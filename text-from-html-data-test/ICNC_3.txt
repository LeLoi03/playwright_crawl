 Feature papers represent the most advanced research with significant potential for high impact in the field. A Feature Paper should be a substantial original Article that involves several techniques or approaches, provides an outlook for future research directions and describes possible research applications.  
 Feature papers are submitted upon individual invitation or recommendation by the scientific editors and must receive positive feedback from the reviewers.  
   
 Editor’s Choice articles are based on recommendations by the scientific editors of MDPI journals from around the world. Editors select a small number of articles recently published in the journal that they believe will be particularly interesting to readers, or important in the respective research area. The aim is to provide a snapshot of some of the most exciting work published in the various research areas of the journal.

 Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Grading from Multi-Channel EEG Time-Series Data Using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network  by Shuwen Yu  ,  William P. Marnane  ,  Geraldine B. Boylan  and  Gordon Lightbody

 A deep learning classifier is proposed for grading hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in neonates. Rather than using handcrafted features, this architecture can be fed with raw EEG. Fully convolutional layers were adopted both in the feature extraction and classification blocks, which makes this architecture simpler, and deeper, but with fewer parameters. Here, two large (335 h and 338 h, respectively) multi-center neonatal continuous EEG datasets were used for training and testing. The model was trained based on weak labels and channel independence. A majority vote method was used for the post-processing of the classifier results (across time and channels) to increase the robustness of the prediction. A dimension reduction tool, UMAP, was used to visualize the model classification effect. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 86.09% (95% confidence interval: 82.41–89.78%), an MCC of 0.7691, and an AUC of 86.23% on the large unseen test set. Two convolutional neural network architectures which utilized time-frequency distribution features were selected as the baseline as they had been developed or tested on the same datasets. A relative improvement of 23.65% in test accuracy was obtained as compared with the best baseline. In addition, if only one channel was available, the test accuracy was only reduced by 2.63–5.91% compared with making decisions based on the eight channels. Full article
