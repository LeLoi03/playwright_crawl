  The 19 th  International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems, Applications AIMSA 2024   
   
  - Towards efficient and sustainable AI methods, systems and applications -  
   
  Golden Sands resort, Varna, Bulgaria September 18 th  - 20 th  , 2024  
   
  **** Proceedings published by Springer/LNCS ****     

 Initiated in 1984, the biennial Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems, Applications (AIMSA) conference is a premier single-track forum for exchanging information and research results on theory and principles of artificial intelligence (AI) along with real-world applications of intelligent systems technology. The conference traditionally brings together researchers and practitioners in all areas of AI from both the academia and industry to meet and share their ideas and experiences and learn about the recent trends and developments in contemporary AI.  
 The 19 th  edition of AIMSA will be held in the beautiful Golden Sands resort near Varna, Bulgaria. With its mild climate and excellent opportunities for outdoor activities, water sports and gastronomy, Golden Sands promise to be a wonderful venue for a memorable conference.  
 TOPICS   The conference is looking for submissions offering innovative methods, systems and applications that demonstrate efficiency and sustainability for the future of AI. Efficiency can be demonstrated against current and traditional methods, systems and applications. Sustainability relates to the required resources, computational power, human wellbeing, positive impact on science and the society.  
 The conference will have three streams, namely:  
 Innovative methods for efficient and sustainable AI 
  Systems for the development and the implementations of efficient and sustainable AI 
  Novel efficient and sustainable AI applications 
   
 All submissions will be subject to a single-blind academic peer review by at least three members of the program committee. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and quality of presentation.  
 The author(s) of the best paper (which will be selected based on the votes of the attendees) of the conference will receive the Best Paper Award during the conference.
