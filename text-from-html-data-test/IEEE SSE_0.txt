 Introduction of SCC  

 Services account for a major part of the IT industry today. Companies increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area and use IT services to address all their peripheral needs. Services Computing is a new science which aims to study and better understand the foundations of this highly popular industry. It covers the science and technology of leveraging computing and information technology to model, create, operate, and manage business services. The 2022 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2022) will contribute in building the pillars of this important science and shaping the future of Services Computing. Part of the SCF 2018, SCC 2018  was successfully held on June 25 - June 30, 2018, Seattle, USA. Part of the SCF 2019, SCC 2019  was successfully held on June 25 - 30, 2019, San Diego, USA. Part of the SCF 2020, SCC 2020  and SCC 2021  was successfully held over the Internet. SCC 2022 was successfully held on December 10 - 14, 2022, Hawaii, USA. SCC 2023 was successfully held on December 17 - 18, 2023, Shenzhen, China. In 2024, we will celebrate our 2024 version of gathering, to strive to advance the largest international professional forum on user-centric services.  
 SCC 2024 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2024 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2024 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2024), 2024 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2024), 2024 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2024), 2024 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2024), 2024 International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2024), and 2024 International Conference on Metaverse (METAVERSE 2024), 2024 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2024), 2024 International conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2024), 2024 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2024), and 2024 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2024).  
 As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), the first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)   was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 ( ICWS-Europe 2003  ) was held in Germany in October 2003. ICWS-Europe'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services ( ECOWS  ), which was held at Erfurt, Germany.  
 Sponsored by Services Society and Springer, SCF 2018 and SCF 2019 were held successfully in Seattle and San Diego, USA. SCF 2020 and SCF 2021 was held successfully online and in Shenzhen, China. SCF 2023 was held successfully in Shenzhen, China. To celebrate its 21-year-old birthday, SCF 2024 will be held on November 16 - 19, 2024, Bangkok, Thailand  .
