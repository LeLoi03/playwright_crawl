 10-Year Impact Award  
   
 The 10-Year Impact Award was awarded to  
 Roman Rädle, Hans-Christian Jetter, Nicolai Marquardt, Harald Reiterer, and Yvonne Rogers  for their work on  
 HuddleLamp: Spatially-Aware Mobile Displays for Ad-hoc Around-the-Table Collaboration   
 https://doi.org/10.1145/2669485.2669500   
  The Impact Award is awarded to a paper published at ISS (ITS in the past) a decade ago. This year’s award went to a paper published at ITS 2014. The Impact Award recipients were decided by a jury consisting of this year’s Papers Chairs (ISS 2023), Papers Chairs from ITS 2014, as well as senior members of the community.  
 The award is given to a paper that has had a significant impact on the ISS community, the broader human-computer interaction community, or the industry. The jury evaluated papers from a number of perspectives, like citations and how they developed over time, which venues and what kinds of papers were citing the work, and the extent of forward-thinking ideas, concepts, or prototypes that would later be adopted widely.

 Congratulations to the award recipients!
