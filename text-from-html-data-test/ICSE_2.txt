  11th ACM/IEEE International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems   
 (SESoS 2023)   
 Hybrid Workshop Announcement    
 The ICSE organizing team will support SESoS 2023 to be held as a hybrid workshop  based on a moderately effective Zoom session for the duration allowing remote presenting/interaction. We encourage authors and other participants to attend SESoS and ICSE for in-person interactions in Melbourne, but authors will be allowed to register for the workshop and do virtual presentations on the workshop date (May 14th, 2023).   
 The 11th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS 2023) provides researchers and practitioners with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, analyze research and development issues, discuss promising solutions, and propose theoretical foundations for development and evolution of complex software-intensive systems, inspiring visions for the future of Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems (SoS) and Software Ecosystems (SECO), as well as paving the way for a more structured community effort.  
 SoS have become increasingly complex and frequently used in highly distributed, dynamic, and open environments. SoS refer to evolving software systems in which constituent systems (themselves systems in their own right) cooperatively work to fulfill specific, complex missions, facing Software Engineering researchers and practitioners with substantial challenges. SECO have also become an important research topic, addressing social issues along with technical aspects of software development. SoS and SECO are closely related and naturally distributed in development teams. In both fields, distributed resources aim at reducing cost and reaching new Information Technology markets. Software Engineering-related problems and challenges are amplified and become more critical when SoS and SECO are analyzed together.  
 Following the successful editions of SESoS in 2013-2018, WDES in 2007-2018, and the joint editions of SESoS/WDES in 2017-2021, this year’s workshop proceeds as SESoS 2022 and focuses on coping with challenges and opportunities on the development and evolution of complex software-intensive systems as well as on the modeling and analysis of technological, organizational, and social solutions in this context.  
 NEWS   
 Authors of the best regular papers of SESoS 2023 will be awarded in the workshop closing session and invited to submit extended versions of their works to a Special Issue in Journal of Software: Evolution and Process   .

 Call for Papers  
  
 Paper Submission and Publication   
 All submitted papers should describe original work and not be published or under review anywhere. The papers must be written in English and will be judged by at least three reviewers on the basis of their clarity, relevance, originality, and contribution.  
 SESoS seeks two kinds of paper submissions:  
 Regular paper  ( at most 8 pages  ): describing original, substantial contributions in research and/or practice; and 
  Position papers and experience reports  ( at most 4 pages  ): describing emerging results, lessons learned, and open problems from concrete applications, or novel ideas and perspectives on research. 
  The page limits include abstract, all figures, tables, and references.  
 All papers should follow the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  and be submitted in PDF format via the EasyChair submission system  . Authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill an electronic IEEE Copyright Form and they will receive further instructions for camera-ready versions.  
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 All accepted and presented papers will appear at the IEEE Digital Library, i.e., it is subject to a mandatory registration and presentation of at least one author of each accepted paper at the workshop.  
 The review process is single-blind  (i.e., authors’ information should be included in the paper).  
 All questions about IEEE template should be emailed to Prof. Awdren Fontão (Proceedings Chair) - awdren.fontao@ufms.br   
 Best Papers Awards   
 Authors of the best regular papers of SESoS 2023 will be awarded in the workshop closing session and invited to submit extended versions of their works to a Special Issue in Journal of Software: Evolution and Process   .   
 Topics of Interest   
 The workshop will focus on the following (and similar) themes:  
 Support to development process (analysis, architecture, construction, maintenance and evolution); 
  Complexity and systems thinking applied to system management and engineering; 
  Platform development and governance; 
  Modeling and analysis; 
  Dynamic reconfiguration at different levels (strategic, tactical, operational) to revisit coordination mechanisms and emergent behavior; 
  Studies on specific domains and areas (open source, mobile, embedded, autonomous systems, AI, digital transformations, IoT technologies, telecommunication etc.); 
  Business and social aspects; 
  Stakeholder communication and coordination; 
  Human and technical trust (in particular, building trust in ecosystems and ecosystem components); 
  Mining software repositories; 
  Security and privacy; 
  Simulation and model-based engineering; 
  Agile development; 
  Decision-making processes and tools; 
  Detection of anomalous behaviors; 
  Techniques and tools for verification/validation/testing; 
  Sustainability and diversity; 
  Continuous engineering practices and digital twins; 
  Empirical Software Engineering for SoS and SECO; 
  Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies; 
  Experience from industrial perspectives and case studies; 
  Challenges and directions for research and practice; 
  Strategies, relationships, and applications of SoS and SECO.
