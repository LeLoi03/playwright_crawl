 Call for Workshops & Tutorials  

 Call for Workshops and Tutorials   
 The 33rd edition of ISFPGA ​invites the submission of half-day and full-day tutorial and workshop proposals. The tutorials and workshops will be held on​ March 1, 2025  in Monterey, California, USA. The aim of the conference tutorial and workshops is to emphasize emerging topics related but not limited to FPGA architectures and tools, reconfigurable computing, and custom hardware acceleration for applications such as communications, machine learning, networking, and other problems. The tutorials are expected to enable beginning researchers to enter the area, current researchers to broaden their scope, and practitioners to gain new insights and applicable skills. The workshops should highlight current topics related to technical and/or industry issues and should include a set of invited presentations and/or panels that encourage the participation of attendees in active discussion.  
 Proposal Format:   
 Each proposal (maximum 2 pages) must include:  
 Title of the tutorial or workshop 
  Organizers: names, affiliation, contact information
