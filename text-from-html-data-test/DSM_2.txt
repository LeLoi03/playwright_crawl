  Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) languages provide a viable and time-tested solution for continuing to raise the level of abstraction, and thus productivity, beyond coding, making systems and software development faster and easier.  
 In DSM, the models are constructed using concepts that represent things in the application domain, not concepts of a given programming language. The modeling language follows the domain abstractions and semantics, allowing developers to perceive them-selves as working directly with domain concepts. Together with frameworks and platforms, DSM can automate a large portion of software production.

 Call for Papers and Demonstrations  
  
 The goals of the workshop are to collect and exchange experiences related to building and using DSMs; continue building and extending the DSM community; and address in focus groups the issues raised in the presented papers and at previous workshops  .  
 The 17th workshop on DSM welcomes submissions that address Domain-Specific Modeling on practical or theoretical levels. They can be research papers, experience reports, position papers or demonstration papers. Some of the issues that we would like to see addressed in this workshop are:  
 Industry/academic experience reports describing success/failure in implementing and using DSM languages/tools 
  Approaches to identify constructs for DSM languages 
  Novel features in language workbenches / tools to support DSM 
  Approaches to implement metamodel-based modeling languages 
  Metamodeling frameworks and languages 
  Modularization technologies for DSM languages and models 
  Novel approaches for code generation from domain-specific models 
  Issues of support/maintenance for systems built with DSM 
  Evolution of languages along with their domain 
  Organizational and process issues in DSM adoption and use 
  Format and Submission   
 Authors are invited to submit their papers in PDF using the submission system at https://dsm19.hotcrp.com/  .
