 The conference aims to gather researchers and developers from both academia and industry worldwide and to explore the state of the art and the prospects of computer vision systems  . The perspective on systems that ICVS historically has, offers a unique opportunity for sharing competence in application development and for elaborating on challenging application-driven research questions.  
 In this context, ICVS 2023 will focus on key application areas for advanced computer vision systems, including but not limited to robotics, healthcare and assisted living and surveillance.
