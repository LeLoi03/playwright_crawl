 SPLASH 2023  
   
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery, to make it the premier conference on the applications of programming languages - at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering.  
 We welcome the community to join us in Lisbon to celebrate humanity at the core of the software development process. We encourage everyone to participate in the many different events co-located with SPLASH, such as OOPSLA or Onward! Papers and Essays. Once again, researchers will circumnavigate the world to meet in Lisbon to discuss science and humanities.  

 Recorded Talks on Youtube  
   
 All the recorded talks are available on SIGPLAN YouTube Channel   
 If you wished to not make your video public, please send and email to sigplan-av+splash23@googlegroups.com  and the Video Chairs will take it down. Please do not  report the video to YouTube as copyright strikes can suspend the channel.
