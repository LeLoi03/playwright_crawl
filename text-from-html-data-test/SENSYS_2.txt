   Conference Call for Papers  
 The ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2023) is the premier computer systems conference focused on the architecture, design, implementation, and performance of networked sensing systems, sensor-oriented data modeling and analytics, and sensor-enabled applications. This year, SenSys is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first SenSys conference held in November, 2003. ACM SenSys brings together academic, industry, and government professionals to a single-track, highly selective forum that takes a broad view on the areas of computing relevant to the future of networked embedded sensor systems. Topics of interests include, but are not limited to, the following:  
   
  ● New platforms and hardware designs for networked sensor systems  
  ● New communication paradigms for ubiquitous connectivity  
  ● Low-power wireless media access control, network, and transport protocol designs  
  ● Systems software, including operating systems, network stacks, and programming  
  ● System services such as time and location estimation  
  ● Low-power operation, energy harvesting, and energy management  
  ● Resource-efficient machine learning for embedded and mobile platforms  
  ● Mobile and pervasive systems with elements of networked sensing  
  ● Data management and analytics, including quality, integrity, and trustworthiness  
  ● Learning algorithms and models for perception, understanding, and adaptation  
  ● Heterogeneous collaborative sensing, including human-robot sensor systems  
  ● Security and privacy in networked sensor applications and systems  
  ● Equity and fairness impacts of automated sensing and decision systems  
  ● Fault-tolerance, dependability, and verification  
  ● Applications and deployment experiences

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2016 edition, 0.00%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 42.25%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 1.41%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 28.17%  of all publications and 28.17%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
