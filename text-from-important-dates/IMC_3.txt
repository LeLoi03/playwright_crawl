 The 2025 Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a three-and-a-half day event focusing on Internet measurement and analysis. The conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. IMC 2025 is the 25th in a series  of highly successful Internet Measurement Workshops and Conferences.  
 The ACM IMC 2025 conference will be held from October 28-31, 2025 in Madison, WI, USA.  
 Announcements  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected. As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see the Call for Papers   . Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.
