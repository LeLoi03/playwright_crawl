 Special Theme: Social REsponsibility   
 The technological progress, the increasing digitalization and emerging trends offer great potential to positively support and facilitate our everyday life. Due to this tremendous influence that technology nowadays has on our society, it is (increasingly) important to carefully consider the impact that digital solutions have on our society during development activities.  
 RE is a socio-technical discipline that aims to understand and analyze the needs of stakeholders affected by the introduction of digital solutions and to communicate these needs to the development team. This mediator role enables our community to have a major impact on the goals, capabilities, functionalities and qualities of digital solutions and thus take RESPONSIBILITY for the social impact that these solutions bring. With this special theme we aim to raise awareness for this “Social REsponsibility”, to share challenges / ideas / project experience and to foster discussions around the following questions:  
 How can our RE community contribute to the “social good”? 
  How to support “Responsible Design” through requirements engineering? 
  How to actively involve the society (respectively large / heterogeneous stakeholder groups) into RE activities (e.g., co-creation / co-design)? 
  How to systematically derive, engineer and evaluate social values and impact? 
  How to align social needs and “intelligent” systems evolution? 
  Paper Categories   
 We invite submissions along the following categories:  
 Technical design papers (15 pages incl. references)  describe the design of new artifacts, i.e., novel solutions for problems relevant to practice and/or significant and theoretically sound improvements of existing solutions. A preliminary validation of the artifacts is also expected. 
  Scientific evaluation papers (15 pages incl. references)  investigate existing real-world problems, evaluate existing artifacts implemented in real-world settings, or validate newly designed artifacts, e.g., by means such as case studies, action research, quasi-controlled experiments, simulations, surveys, or secondary studies if they clearly synthesize the state of reported evidence in literature (via systematic literature reviews or mapping studies). Please refer also to the Empirical Standards for guidelines and review criteria for each research method: https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards 
  Experience report papers (12 pages incl. references)  describe retrospective reports on experiences in applying RE techniques in practice, or addressing RE problems in real-world contexts. These papers focus on reporting the experience and give special attention to practical insights, lessons learned, and/or key takeaways and recommendations to the community. Experience reports may also include studies in which the authors interview practitioners about the application of specific RE techniques or about RE problems in practice. 
  Vision papers (8 pages incl. references)  state where research in the field should be heading. 
  Research previews (8 pages incl. references)  describe well-defined research ideas at an early stage of investigation which may not be fully developed. 
  Each type of paper has its own review criteria, which are listed here.  
 Finally, we cordially invite authors to disclose their research artifacts following our open science guidelines. Authors who wish to disclose their artifacts can find further guidance and support under the Open Science Initiative  .  
 Submission, Reviewing and Publication   
 Contributions must be submitted to Easychair ( https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=refsq2025  )  
 Each submission in the scope of REFSQ will undergo a single-blind review process that will involve at least three members of the program committee.

 Review Criteria  
   
 Each paper category has its own review criteria. We invite authors and reviewers to check the criteria and consider their order of relevance. We also invite authors and reviewers to consider the Open Science initiative  .  
 Technical design papers (15 pages incl. references)   
 Describe the design of new artifacts, i.e., novel solutions for requirements-related problems or significant improvements of existing solutions. A preliminary evaluation of the artifacts is also expected.  
 Review Criteria (in order of relevance):  
 Novelty  : to what extent is the proposed solution novel with respect to the state-of-the-art? To what extent is related literature considered? To what extent did the authors clarify their contribution? [NOTE: The potential lack of novelty is NOT an argument for rejection, but we expect authors to clearly convey the novelty of their contribution in light of the existing body of knowledge 
  Potential Impact/Relevance  : is the potential impact on research and practice clearly stated? Is the potential impact convincing? Has the proposed solution been preliminarily evaluated in a representative setting? 
  Soundness  : has the novel solution been developed according to recognised research methods? Is the preliminary evaluation of the solution sound? Did the authors clearly state the research questions? Are the conclusions of the preliminary evaluation logically derived from the data? Did the authors discuss the limitations of the proposal? 
  Verifiability  : did the authors share their software? Did the authors share their data? Did the authors share their material? Did the authors provide guidelines on how to reuse their artfiacts and replicate their results? [NOTE: sharing data and software is NOT mandatory, but papers that make an effort in this direction should be adequately rewarded] 
  Presentation  : is the paper clearly presented? To what extent can the content of the paper be understood by the general RE public? If highly technical content is presented, did the authors make an effort to also summarise their proposal in an intuitive way? 
  Scientific evaluation papers (15 pages incl. references)   
 Investigate existing real-world problems, evaluate existing real-world implemented artifacts, or validate newly designed artifacts, e.g., by means of case studies, experiments, simulation, surveys, systematic literature reviews, mapping studies, or action research. You might want to check the Empirical Standards for guidelines and review criteria for each research strategy at https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards  .  
 Review Criteria (in order of relevance):  
 Soundness  : has the novel solution been developed according to recognised research methods? Is the research method justified? Is the research method adequate for the problem at hand?
