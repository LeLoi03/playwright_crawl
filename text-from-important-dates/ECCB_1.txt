 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.
