  April 22-24, 2025, Patras, Greece   

  to ANT 2025  
 The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2025) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.
