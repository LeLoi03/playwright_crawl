        
 The 19th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications  
  August 5-7, 2024, Marshall University, Huntington, WV, USA   

   to FNC 2024 that will be held in conjunction with  
   The 21th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC)  &  
  The 14th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology (SEIT)   
  
 What is it about?  Research in networks and communication technologies requires very significant investments of stakeholders for enabling our future networking society. Research in network communication has made several possible innovations having a strong influence on people's lives. Mobile communications and the Internet are two outstanding examples. Future Networks and Communications technologies, including mobile broadband and all optical networks are the key to the ground-breaking inventions to our future technologies. It will enable us to design and build the future communication infrastructure interconnecting and empowering the next generation enabling platforms.  
 While the technology itself develops faster and faster, the deployment and implementation of a new network infrastructure technology can take up to ten years. The future networks communication research will deliver the next generation of network technologies enabling smart connectivity for all, anywhere, and at any time at the highest speed and efficiency so as to meet the overwhelming demand by today's society. This is why we need to enable a very reliable and dependable future networks and communication to ensure that industries; businesses and consumers can access and use the most advanced content and services they call for.  
 Location:  FNC 2024 will be held in Marshall University, Huntington, West Virginia, USA. Huntington, WV, is strategically located at the heart of the Tri-State area, which encompasses parts of West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. This central location makes it a convenient meeting point for conference attendees from across these states and beyond. Conference attendees have the advantage of easy access to multiple airports, ensuring a smooth journey to Huntington. Notable airports in proximity include: Huntington Tri-State Airport (HTS), Yeager Airport (CRW) & Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG). From the vibrant cultural scene to the stunning natural beauty of the Appalachian region, Huntington sets the stage for a truly unforgettable conference experience.  
 Target Audience:  International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC) is designed for practitioners, researchers, scientists and administrators, in the development arenas. FNC will become the new "system blood" as it aims to provide discussions and simulations in the communication technology at the broad level and broadcasting technology and related technologies at the micro level. Through a set of research papers, using innovative and interactive approach, participants can expect to share a set of research that will prepare them to apply new technologies to their work in teaching, research and educational development amid this rapidly evolving landscape.  
 There will be opportunities to attend interactive, high quality, peer reviewed sessions, which will provide detailed insights from forward thinkers working in the themes of the conference. The conference will include a number of specialized workshops as well. Additionally there will be an exhibition for both international businesses and markets to display their latest products and services and to undertake a range of networking opportunities.  
 Scope of FNC:  FNC research effort will help achieving a major promise of the emerging technologies such as, ubiquitous access to broadband, supporting vital applications in our daily lives such as health, energy consumption, environment transport, entertainment or education. The scope of FNC is the development of energy-efficient future network infrastructures that support the convergence and interoperability of heterogeneous mobile, wired and wireless broadband network technologies as enablers of the future Internet. This includes but not limited to ubiquitous fast broadband access and ultra-high speed end-to-end optical connectivity, supporting open services and innovative ambient applications. Scope also embraces novel and evolutionary approaches to tackle network architectures, taking due consideration of users and societal needs for success.
