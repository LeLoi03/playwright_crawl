WAFR is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting of international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. Since its inception in 1994, WAFR has established a reputation as a premier venue for presenting algorithmic work related to robotics. The focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. The design and analysis of algorithms and foundations of robotics raise unique questions in a variety of traditional and new fields.
