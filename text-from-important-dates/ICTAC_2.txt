 Scope   
  The ICTAC conference series aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present research and exchange ideas and experiences within theoretical aspects of computing through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to promote research cooperation between developing and industrial countries.  
 Topics   
  The conference concerns all aspects of theoretical computer science, including, but not limited to:  
    Formal languages and automata    
    Semantics of programming languages    
    Logic in computer science    
    Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory    
    Domain-specific languages    
    Theories of concurrency and mobility    
    Theories of distributed computing    
    Models of objects and components    
    Coordination models    
    Timed, hybrid, embedded, and cyber-physical systems    
    Security and privacy    
    Static analysis    
    Software verification    
    Software testing    
    Program generation and transformation    
    Model checking and theorem-proving    
    Theoretical aspects of quantum computing    
    Theory and methods of trustworthy AI    
    Applications and experiences    

 Publication   
  All accepted papers in categories will appear in the proceedings of the conference that will be published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
  
  All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline, and present the paper.  
  
  There will be a special issue for selected papers from ICTAC 2024 in the Elsevier’s journal Theoretical Computer Science  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
  We solicit submissions, related to the topics of ICTAC, in the following categories:  
    Full papers  describing original research contributions    
    Short papers  describing original work in progress, new ideas, and emerging challenges; and    
    Tool papers  describing tools supporting formal techniques for software modeling, system design, and verification.  
  Submissions must not exceed 16 pages (excluding a bibliography of a maximum of 2 pages). Short and tool papers should not exceed 8 pages.    

 Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged based on originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference’s topics.  
   
  All contributions to ICTAC 2024 have to be submitted electronically in PDF format via Easy Chair  
   
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac24    
   
  Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers (see http://www.springer.com/lncs   ), without modifications of margins and other space-saving measures. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ instructions and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.  
 Venue   
  ICTAC 2024 will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Leiden University. A two-day tutorial and training lectures preceding the conference will take place at the AIT campus in the north of Bangkok. The main conference will be held at the Berkley Hotel conveniently located in the heart of Bangkok. For more information about the venue click here.    
 Contact  
   All questions about submissions should be emailed to the program committee chairs Chutiporn Anutariya and Marcello Bonsangue.
