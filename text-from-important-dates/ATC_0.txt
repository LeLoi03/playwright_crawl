  Call for Papers  
  
 The 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum for sharing the latest research results, ideas, and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation, and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly relying on autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture, to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.  
 Despite this rise in autonomic and self-* systems, there remains a wide range of fundamental challenges in understanding how to design, control, reason about, and trust such systems. The ACSOS conference solicits novel research on these topics in fundamentals and methods as well as applications for autonomic and self-* systems. ACSOS is particularly proud of its long-standing academic breadth and innovative industry contributions and regularly features work from computational biologists through to operating systems researchers â€“ united by the common theme of autonomous systems. The conference program will include research papers, in-practice experience reports, posters, demos, and a doctoral symposium. ACSOS 2024 solicits contributions from among (but not limited to) the following autonomic, self-adaptive and self-organizing theories, methods, and applications:  
 Theories   
 Heuristics 
  Optimization and configuration algorithms 
  Models for complex and adaptive systems 
  Methods   
 Support for adaptive systems | monitoring 
  analyzing 
  planing 
  execution 
  Specification of adaptation in | processes for development, 
  deployment 
  runtime 
  System support for adaptive systems | Operating systems 
  Middleware 
  Communication 
  Distributed learning (e.g., federated learning) 
  Applications   
 Software support for adaptive systems | Patterns in monitoring, analyzing, planning, execution 
  Software architectures 
  Languages for adaptive 
  Experiences and domains | Applications of self-organization in specific use cases 
  Insights of applying and evaluating real-world self-organizing systems | generic platforms, i.e., middleware, operating systems 
  specific applications 
  LLMs for self-adaptive and self-organizing systems (e.g., multi-robot planning) 
  Please note that this list is non-exhaustive. ACSOS strives to be a home for research in adaptive and self-organizing systems.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Research Papers  (up to 10 pages, including images, tables, and references) should present novel ideas in the cross-disciplinary research context described in this call, motivated by problems from current practice or applied research.  
 Experience Reports  (up to 10 pages, including images, tables, and references) cover innovative implementations, novel applications, interesting performance results, and experience in applying recent research advances to practical situations on any topics of interest.  
 Vision Papers  (up to 6 pages, including images, tables, and references) introduce ground-shaking, provocative, and even controversial ideas; discuss long-term perspectives and challenges; focus on overlooked or underrepresented areas, and foster debate.  
 All submissions  will be subject to a rigorous double-blind  peer-review and evaluated based on given criteria.  
 Further instructions will follow.
