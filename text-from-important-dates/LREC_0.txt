 LREC-COLING 2024 - The 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation  

 Lingotto Conference Centre - Torino (Italia)  

 20-25 May, 2024  

 The three-day main conference (22-23-24, May) will be accompanied by a total of three days of workshops and tutorials (20-21-25, May) held in the days immediately before and after.  

 Two major international key players in the area of computational linguistics, the ELRA Language Resources Association  (ELRA) and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics  (ICCL), are joining forces to organize the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation  (LREC-COLING 2024) to be held in Torino  (Italy) on 20-25 May, 2024.   
 The hybrid  conference will bring together researchers and practitioners in computational linguistics, speech, multimodality, and natural language processing, with special attention to evaluation and the development of resources that support work in these areas. Following in the tradition of the well-established parent conferences COLING  and LREC  , the joint conference will feature grand challenges and provide ample opportunity for attendees to exchange information and ideas through both oral presentations and extensive poster sessions, complemented by a friendly social program.  

 The 2024 LREC-COLING Joint Conference will be a one-time shot, then both conferences will be organized alternatively and as stand-alone: COLING in 2025 and LREC in 2026, COLING in 2027 and LREC in 2028, etc.
