  TL;DR:  We study the free exploration mechanism in the multi-agent multi-armed bandits with heterogeneous reward model.   Abstract:   
 This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent bandit scenario in which the rewards observed by agents are heterogeneous---one agent's meat can be another agent's poison. Specifically, the total reward observed by each agent is the sum of two values: an arm-specific reward, capturing the intrinsic value of the arm, and a privately-known agent-specific reward, which captures the personal preference/limitations of the agent. This heterogeneity in total reward leads to different local optimal arms for agents but creates an opportunity for *free exploration* in a cooperative setting---an agent can freely explore its local optimal arm with no regret and share this free observation with some other agents who would suffer regrets if they pull this arm since the arm is not optimal for them. We first characterize a regret lower bound that captures free exploration, i.e., arms that can be freely explored have no contribution to the regret lower bound. Then, we present a cooperative bandit algorithm that takes advantage of free exploration and achieves a near-optimal regret upper bound which tightly matches the regret lower bound up to a constant factor. Lastly, we run numerical simulations to compare our algorithm with various baselines without free exploration. 
 ID: 11 | ViBid: Linear Vision Transformer with Bidirectional Normalization   
  TL;DR:  We empirically demonstrated the shortcomings of softmax-free and the significance of softmax in attention through BiNorm experiments. Binorm is the simplest adaptation of the current matrix multiplication order-changing algorithms.   Abstract:   
 The vision transformer has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks; however, the memory consumption is larger than those of previous convolutional neural network based models because of O(N^2) time and memory complexity of the general self-attention models. Many approaches aim to change the complexity to O(N) to solve this problem; however, they stack deep convolutional layers to retain locality or complicate the architecture as seen in window attention, to compensate for the performance degradation. To solve these problems, we propose ViBid algorithm, which resolves the complexity problem of O(N^2) by replacing Softmax with bidirectional normalization (BiNorm). In addition, it has a much simpler architecture than the existing transformer model with O(N) complexity. Owing to our simple architecture, we were able to use larger resolutions for training, and we obtained a lighter and superior GPU throughput model with competitive performance. ViBid can be used with any transformer method that uses queries, keys, and values (QKV) because of BiNorm, and it is quite universal due to its simple architectural structure.

  TL;DR:  The paper proposes a series of matrix correction algorithms that estimate similarity matrices with incomplete data streams in different online scenarios.   Abstract:   
 The similarity matrix measures the pairwise similarities between a set of data points. It is an essential concept in data processing and is routinely used in practical applications. Obtaining the similarity matrix is usually trivial when the data points are completely observed. However, getting a high-quality similarity matrix often turns hard when there are incomplete observations, which becomes even more complex on sequential data streams. To address the challenge, we propose matrix correction algorithms that leverage the positive semi-definiteness of the similarity matrix to provide improved similarity estimation in both offline and online scenarios. Our approaches have a solid theoretical guarantee of performance and excellent potential for parallel execution on large-scale data. They also exhibit high effectiveness and efficiency in empirical evaluations with significantly improved results over the classical imputation-based methods, benefiting downstream applications with superior performance. 
  TL;DR:  We develop a Gaussian Process based-method to learn choice functions from choice data via Pareto rationalisation.   Abstract:   
 In consumer theory, ranking available objects by means of preference relations yields the most common description of individual choices. However, preference-based models assume that individuals: (1) give their preferences only between pairs of objects; (2) are always able to pick the best preferred object. In many situations, they may be instead choosing out of a set with more than two elements and, because of lack of information and/or incomparability (objects with contradictory characteristics), they may not able to select a single most preferred object. To address these situations, we need a choice-model which allows an individual to express a set-valued choice. Choice functions provide such a mathematical framework. We propose a Gaussian Process model to learn choice functions from choice-data. The proposed model assumes a multiple utility representation of a choice function based on the concept of Pareto rationalisation, and derives a strategy to learn both the number and the values of these latent multiple utilities. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 
    Abstract:   
 Neural Processes (NPs) are appealing due to their ability to perform fast adaptation based on a context set. This set is encoded by a latent variable, which is often assumed to follow a simple distribution. However, in real-word settings, the context set may be drawn from richer distributions having multiple modes, heavy tails, etc. In this work, we provide a framework that allows NPs’ latent variable to be given a rich prior defined by a graphical model. These distributional assumptions directly translate into an appropriate aggregation strategy for the context set. Moreover, we describe a message-passing procedure that still allows for end-to-end optimization with stochastic gradients. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by using mixture and Student-t assumptions that yield improvements in function modelling and test-time robustness.

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel Stochastic GFlowNet method for extending GFlowNets to the more general stochastic environments.   Abstract:   
 Generative Flow Networks (or GFlowNets for short) are a family of probabilistic agents that learn to sample complex combinatorial structures through the lens of ``inference as control''. They have shown great potential in generating high-quality and diverse candidates from a given energy landscape. However, existing GFlowNets can be applied only to deterministic environments, and fail in more general tasks with stochastic dynamics, which can limit their applicability. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces Stochastic GFlowNets, a new algorithm that extends GFlowNets to stochastic environments. By decomposing state transitions into two steps, Stochastic GFlowNets isolate environmental stochasticity and learn a dynamics model to capture it. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic GFlowNets offer significant advantages over standard GFlowNets as well as MCMC- and RL-based approaches, on a variety of standard benchmarks with stochastic dynamics. 
  TL;DR:  BISCUIT identifies causal variables from high-dimensional observations using binary interactions between an external system (e.g. robot) and the causal variables.   Abstract:   
 Identifying the causal variables of an environment and how to intervene on them is of core value in applications such as robotics and embodied AI. While an agent can commonly interact with the environment and may implicitly perturb the behavior of some of these causal variables, often the targets it affects remain unknown. In this paper, we show that causal variables can still be identified for many common setups, e.g., additive Gaussian noise models, if the agent's interactions with a causal variable can be described by an unknown binary variable. This happens when each causal variable has two different mechanisms, e.g., an observational and an interventional one. Using this identifiability result, we propose BISCUIT, a method for simultaneously learning causal variables and their corresponding binary interaction variables. On three robotic-inspired datasets, BISCUIT accurately identifies causal variables and can even be scaled to complex, realistic environments for embodied AI.

  TL;DR:  This paper proposed a memory mechanism to enable the model learning to know unknowns.   Abstract:   
 Unsupervised anomaly detection is a binary classification that detects anomalies in unseen samples given only unlabeled normal data. Reconstruction-based approaches are widely used, which perform reconstruction error minimization on training data to learn normal patterns and quantify the degree of anomalies by reconstruction errors on testing data. However, this approach tends to miss anomalies when the normal data has multi-pattern. Because the model generalizes unrestrictedly beyond normal patterns even to include anomaly patterns. In this paper, we proposed a memory mechanism that memorizes typical normal patterns through a capacity-controlled external differentiable matrix so that the generalization of the model to anomalies is limited by the retrieval of the matrix. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks. 
  TL;DR:  In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply Dropout.   Abstract:   
 For the stable optimization of deep neural networks, regularization methods such as dropout and batch normalization have been used in various tasks. Nevertheless, the correct position to apply dropout has rarely been discussed, and different positions have been employed depending on the practitioners. In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply dropout. We demonstrate that for a residual network with batch normalization, applying dropout at certain positions increases the performance, whereas applying dropout at other positions decreases the performance. Based on theoretical analysis, we provide the following guideline for the correct position to apply dropout: apply one dropout after the last batch normalization but before the last weight layer in the residual branch. We provide detailed theoretical explanations to support this claim and demonstrate them through module tests. In addition, we investigate the correct position of dropout in the head that produces the final prediction. Although the current consensus is to apply dropout after global average pooling, we prove that applying dropout before global average pooling leads to a more stable output. The proposed guidelines are validated through experiments using different datasets and models. 
    Abstract:   
 Bayesian methods are a popular choice for statistical inference in small-data regimes due to the regularization effect induced by the prior. In the context of density estimation, the standard nonparametric Bayesian approach is to target the posterior predictive of the Dirichlet process mixture model. In general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable and so methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an intermediate step. The recent development of quasi-Bayesian predictive copula updates, however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density estimation without the need for posterior approximation. Although these estimators are computationally appealing, they tend to struggle on non-smooth data distributions. This is due to the comparatively restrictive form of the likelihood models from which the proposed copula updates were derived. To address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric model with an autoregressive likelihood decomposition and a Gaussian process prior. While the predictive update of such a model is typically intractable, we derive a quasi-Bayesian predictive update that achieves state-of-the-art results on moderate-sized examples.

  TL;DR:  We show that probabilistic circuits can be overconfident and not robust to out-of-distribution data, and we overcome this challenge by introducing a tractable sampling-free inference procedure to estimate model uncertainty.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are models that allow exact and tractable probabilistic inference. In contrast to neural networks, they are often assumed to be well-calibrated and robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we show that PCs are in fact not robust to OOD data, i.e., they don't know what they don't know. We then show how this challenge can be overcome by model uncertainty quantification. To this end, we propose tractable dropout inference (TDI), an inference procedure to estimate uncertainty by deriving an analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation. Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty estimates in a single forward pass. TDI improves the robustness of PCs to distribution shift and OOD data, demonstrated through a series of experiments evaluating the classification confidence and uncertainty estimates on real-world data. 
  TL;DR:  We propose a contrastive whole-output explanation method for image classification.   Abstract:   
 Explanations for the outputs of deep neural network classifiers are essential in promoting trust and comprehension among users. Conventional methods often offer explanations only for one single class in the output and neglect other classes with high probabilities, resulting in a limited view of the model's behaviors. In this paper, we propose a holistic explanation method for image classification. It not only facilitates an overall understanding of model behavior, but also provides a framework where one can examine the evidence for discriminating competing classes, and thereby yield contrastive explanations. We demonstrate the advantages of the new method over baselines in terms of both faithfulness to the model and interpretability to users. The source code will be made available to the public upon publication of the paper. 
  TL;DR:  We proposed modified retrace to measure the off-policyness between the target policy and the behavior policy, and obtained a convergence guarantee.   Abstract:   
 Off-policy learning is a key to extend reinforcement learning as it allows to learn a target policy from a different behavior policy that generates the data. However, it is well known as ``the deadly triad'' when combined with bootstrapping and function approximation. Retrace is an efficient and convergent off-policy algorithm with tabular value functions which employs truncated importance sampling ratios. Unfortunately, Retrace is known to be unstable with linear function approximation. In this paper, we propose modified Retrace to correct the off-policy return, derive a new off-policy temporal difference learning algorithm (TD-MRetrace) with linear function approximation, and obtain a convergence guarantee under standard assumptions in both prediction and control cases. Experimental results on counterexamples and control tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with traditional algorithms. 
    Abstract:   
 Imbalanced data is ubiquitous in machine learning, such as medical or fine-grained image datasets. The existing continual learning methods employ various techniques such as balanced sampling to improve classification accuracy in this setting. However, classification accuracy is not a suitable metric for imbalanced data, and hence these methods may not obtain a good classifier as measured by other metrics (e.g., Area under the ROC Curve). In this paper, we propose a solution to enable efficient imbalanced continual learning by designing an algorithm to effectively maximize one widely used metric in an imbalanced data setting: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We find that simply replacing accuracy with AUC will cause \textit{gradient interference problem} due to the imbalanced data distribution. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm, namely DIANA, which performs a novel synthesis of model \underline{D}ecoupl\underline{I}ng \underline{AN}d \underline{A}lignment. In particular, the algorithm updates two models simultaneously: one focuses on learning the current knowledge while the other concentrates on reviewing previously-learned knowledge, and the two models gradually align during training.The results show that DIANA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the imbalanced datasets. 
  TL;DR:  To protect users privacy in machine learning as a service, we introduce an effective and efficient adversarial representation learning method with simple noisy features.   Abstract:   
 Recent real-world applications of deep learning have led to the development of machine learning as a service (MLaaS). However, the scenario of client-server inference presents privacy concerns, where the server processes raw data sent from the user's client device. One solution to this issue is to provide an obfuscator function to the client device using Adversarial Representation Learning (ARL). Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy-utility trade-off while overlooking the computational cost and memory burden on the client side. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient ARL method that incorporates feature noise into the ARL pipeline. We evaluated our approach on various datasets, comparing it with state-of-the-art ARL techniques. Our experimental results indicate that our method achieves better accuracy, lower computation and memory overheads, and improved resistance to information leakage and reconstruction attacks. The code is available in the supplementary and will be made public after publication.

  TL;DR:  Through a proper proposal distribution, one can efficiently and tractably marginalize out missing information in marked temporal point processes, thus allowing for accommodating partially observed sequences.   Abstract:   
 Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are a general class of stochastic models for modeling the evolution of events of different types (``marks'') in continuous time. These models have broad applications in areas such as medical data monitoring, financial prediction, user modeling, and communication networks. Of significant practical interest in such problems is the issue of missing or censored data over time. In this paper, we focus on the specific problem of inference for a trained MTPP model when events of certain types are not observed over a period of time during prediction. We introduce the concept of mark-censored sub-processes and use this framework to develop a novel marginalization technique for inference in the presence of censored marks. The approach is model-agnostic and applicable to any MTPP model with a well-defined intensity function. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the method in the context of both parametric and neural MTPP models, with results across a range of datasets including data from simulated Hawkes processes, self-correcting processes, and multiple real-world event datasets. 
    Abstract:   
 Identifying the causes of an event, also termed as causal attribution, is a commonly encountered task in many application problems. Available methods, mostly in Bayesian or causal inference literature, suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) cannot attributing for individuals, (2) attributing one single cause at a time and cannot deal with the interaction effect among multiple causes. In this paper, based on our proposed new measurement, called conditional counterfactual causality effect (CCCE), we introduce an individual causal attribution method, which is able to utilize the individual observation as the evidence and consider common influence and interaction effect of multiple causes simultaneously. We discuss the identifiability of CCCE and also give the identification formulas under proper assumptions. Finally, we conduct experiments on simulated and real data to illustrate the effectiveness of CCCE and the results show that our proposed method outperforms significantly over state-of-the-art methods.

    Abstract:   
 Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) formalize the problem of designing individual controllers for a group of collaborative agents under stochastic dynamics and partial observability. Seeking a global optimum is difficult (NEXP complete), but seeking a Nash equilibrium ‚Äî each agent policy being a best response to the other agents ‚Äî is more accessible, and allowed addressing infinite-horizon problems with solutions in the form of finite state controllers. In this paper, we show that this approach can be adapted to cases where only a generative model (a simulator) of the Dec-POMDP is available. This requires relying on a simulation-based POMDP solver to construct an agent‚Äôs FSC node by node. A related process is used to heuristically derive initial FSCs. Experiment with benchmarks shows that MC-JESP is competitive with existing Dec-POMDP solvers, even better than many offline methods using explicit models. 
    Abstract:   
 Multi-model Markov decision process(MMDP) is a promising framework for computing policies that are robust to parameter uncertainty in MDPs. MMDPs aim to find a policy that maximizes the expected return over a distribution of MDP models. Because MMDPs are NP-hard to solve, most methods resort to approximations. In this paper, we derive the policy gradient of MMDPs and propose CADP, which combines a coordinate ascent method and a dynamic programming algorithm for solving MMDPs. The main innovation of CADP compared with earlier algorithms is to take the policy gradient perspective to adjust model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy improvements to a local maximum. A theoretical analysis of CADP proves that it never performs worse than previous dynamic programming algorithms like WSU. Our numerical results indicate that CADP substantially outperforms existing methods on several benchmark problems. 
  TL;DR:  To remedy the overfitting issues in deep kernels, we propose utilizing infinite-width neural networks to guide their optimization process and retain their Bayesian merits.   Abstract:   
 Combining Gaussian processes with the expressive power of deep neural networks is commonly done nowadays through deep kernel learning (DKL). Unfortunately, due to the kernel optimization process, this often results in losing their Bayesian benefits. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning deep kernels by utilizing infinite-width neural networks. We propose to use the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) model as a guide to the DKL model in the optimization process. Our approach harnesses the reliable uncertainty estimation of the NNGPs to adapt the DKL target confidence when it encounters novel data points. As a result, we get the best of both worlds, we leverage the Bayesian behavior of the NNGP, namely its robustness to overfitting, and accurate uncertainty estimation, while maintaining the generalization abilities, scalability, and flexibility of deep kernels. Empirically, we show on multiple benchmark datasets of varying sizes and dimensionality, that our method is robust to overfitting, has good predictive performance, and provides reliable uncertainty estimations.

  TL;DR:  We introduce a new single-object geospatial tracking dataset from a distributed camera network and present a modeling framework that considers uncertainties for this task.   Abstract:   
 Visual object tracking has seen significant progress in recent years. However, the vast majority of this work focuses on tracking objects within the image plane of a single camera and ignores the uncertainty associated with predicted object locations. In this work, we focus on the geospatial object tracking problem using data from a distributed camera network. The goal is to predict an object's track in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object's location while respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data. We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable tracker affect performance.

  TL;DR:  A multi-view graph contrasting learning (MVGCL) approach to tackle out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) issue in routing problem, which couples a graph pattern learner in a self-supervised fashion with deep reinforcement learning.   Abstract:   
 Recently, neural heuristics based on deep learning have reported encouraging results for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) instances, e.g. uniform. However, in the presence of a distribution shift for the testing instances, their performance becomes considerably inferior. In this paper, we propose a multi-view graph Contrastive learning (MVGCL) approach to enhance the generalization across different distributions, which exploits two graph pattern learners in a self-supervised fashion to facilitate a neural heuristic equipped with an active search scheme. Specifically, we first propose two augmentation methods that are specially designed for routing problems, and our MVGCL leverages graph contrastive learning to extract transferable patterns from VRP graphs to attain the generalizable multi-view (i.e. node and graph) representation. Then it adopts the learnt node embedding and graph embedding to assist the neural heuristic and the active search (during inference) for route construction, respectively. Extensive experiments on randomly generated VRP instances from various distributions, and the ones from TSPLib and CVRPLib show that our MVGCL is superior to the baselines in boosting the cross-distribution generalization performance.

  TL;DR:  We study three classes of tasks (multi-objective tasks, risk-sensitive tasks, and modal tasks), and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when these tasks can be expressed using scalar, Markovian reward functions.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we study the expressivity of scalar, Markovian reward functions in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and identify several limitations to what they can express. Specifically, we look at three classes of RL tasks (multi-objective RL, risk-sensitive RL, and modal RL), and show that most of the instances in each of these three classes cannot be expressed using scalar, Markovian rewards. Among these three classes, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a problem can be reduced to ordinary, scalar reward reinforcement learning. Modal problems have so far not been given any systematic treatment in the RL literature; we thus call attention to them as a new class of problems. Finally, we also show that many of these problems can be solved by means of bespoke RL approaches: this rules out the possibility that those problems that cannot be expressed using Markovian reward functions also are impossible to learn effectively. 
  TL;DR:  We bound the estimated causal effects of continuous-valued treatments when they might be biased by hidden confounders.   Abstract:   
 Inferring causal effects of continuous-valued treatments from observational data is a crucial task promising to better inform policy- and decision-makers. A critical assumption needed to identify these effects is that all confounding variables---causal parents of both the treatment and the outcome---are included as covariates. Unfortunately, given observational data alone, we cannot know with certainty that this criterion is satisfied. Sensitivity analyses provide principled ways to give bounds on causal estimates when confounding variables are hidden. While much attention is focused on sensitivity analyses for discrete-valued treatments, much less is paid to continuous-valued treatments. We present novel methodology to bound both average and conditional average continuous-valued treatment-effect estimates when they cannot be point identified due to hidden confounding. A semi-synthetic benchmark on multiple datasets shows our method giving tighter coverage of the true dose-response curve than a recently proposed continuous sensitivity model and baselines. Finally, we apply our method to a real-world observational case study to demonstrate the value of identifying dose-dependent causal effects. 
  TL;DR:  We develop a new representation consensus technique that helps combining pre-trained models with different feature spaces.   Abstract:   
 Learning an effective global model on private and decentralized datasets has become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied in practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning, enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling homogeneity and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to many practical scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous sensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to use different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore happens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve consensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion approach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates them into a global representation that improves the prediction performance. Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to learn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction. This paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in real-world applications such as power grids and traffic networks.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we analyse the effect of the convolution operator on the embedding geometry.   Abstract:   
 By recursively summing node features over entire neighborhoods, spatial graph convolution operators have been heralded as key to the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Yet, despite the multiplication of GNN methods across tasks and applications, the effect of this aggregation operation has yet to be analyzed. In fact, while most recent efforts in the GNN community have focused on optimizing the architecture of the neural network, fewer works have attempted to characterize (a) the different classes of spatial convolution operators, (b) their impact on the geometry of the embedding space, and (c) how the choice of a particular convolution should relate to properties of the data. In this paper, we propose to answer all three questions by dividing existing operators into two main classes (symmetrized vs. row-normalized spatial convolutions), and show how these correspond to different implicit biases on the data. Finally, we show that this convolution operator is in fact tunable, and explicit regimes in which certain choices of convolutions --- and therefore, embedding geometries --- might be more appropriate. 
  TL;DR:  Development of event sampling algorithm allowing implementation of PDMP samplers for Bayesian neural networks.   Abstract:   
 Inference on modern Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often relies on a variational inference treatment, imposing violated assumptions of independence and the form of the posterior. Traditional MCMC approaches avoid these assumptions at the cost of increased computation due to its incompatibility to subsampling of the likelihood. New Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) samplers permit subsampling, though introduce a model specific inhomogenous Poisson Process (IPPs) which is difficult to sample from. This work introduces a new generic and adaptive thinning scheme for sampling from these IPPs, and demonstrates how this approach can accelerate the application of PDMPs for inference in BNNs. Experimentation illustrates how inference with these methods is computationally feasible, can improve predictive accuracy, MCMC mixing performance, and provide informative uncertainty measurements when compared against other approximate inference schemes.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm (PERIL) for knowledge-based SDM that learns from interaction experience to reason about contextual knowledge.   Abstract:   
 Sequential decision-making (SDM) methods enable AI agents to compute an action policy toward achieving long-term goals under uncertainty. Existing research has shown that contextual knowledge in declarative forms can be used for improving the performance of SDM methods. However, the contextual knowledge from people tends to be incomplete and sometimes inaccurate, which greatly limits the applicability of knowledge-based SDM methods. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for knowledge-based SDM, called PERIL, that learns from interaction experience to reason about contextual knowledge, as applied to urban driving scenarios. Experiments have been conducted using CARLA, a widely used autonomous driving simulator. Results demonstrate PERIL's superiority in comparison to existing knowledge-based SDM baselines. 
  TL;DR:  By convex relaxations of distributional discrepancy optimizations, our method quantifies how close a chain of models approximates a real-world system.   Abstract:   
 Assessing the validity of a real-world system with respect to given quality criteria is a common yet costly task in industrial applications due to the vast number of required real-world tests. Validating such systems by means of simulation offers a promising and less expensive alternative, but requires an assessment of the simulation accuracy and therefore end-to-end measurements. Additionally, covariate shifts between simulations and actual usage can cause difficulties for estimating the reliability of such systems. In this work, we present a validation method that propagates bounds on distributional discrepancy measures through a composite system, thereby allowing us to derive an upper bound on the failure probability of the real system from potentially inaccurate simulations. Each propagation step entails an optimization problem, where -- for measures such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- we develop tight convex relaxations based on semidefinite programs. We demonstrate that our propagation method yields valid and useful bounds for composite systems exhibiting a variety of realistic effects. In particular, we show that the proposed method can successfully account for data shifts within the experimental design as well as model inaccuracies within the simulation. 
  TL;DR:  We prove that previous attempts on designing group-equivariant ViT not effective in some cases, which is then addressed by a novel, effective equivariant positional encoding.   Abstract:   
 Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in computer vision. However, positional encoding in ViT makes it substantially difficult to realize the equivariance, compared to models based on convolutional operations which are translation-equivariant. Initial attempts have been made on designing equivariant ViT but proved not effective in some cases in this paper. To address this issue, we propose a Group Equivariant Vision Transformer (GE-ViT) via a novel, effective positional encoding operation. We prove that GE-ViT meets all the theoretical requirements of an equivariant neural network. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that GE-ViT has made significant improvement over non-equivariant self-attention networks. The code will be released publicly.

    Abstract:   
 Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models for prediction, which have demonstrated their effectiveness in accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) and strong robustness. Obtaining a diverse ensemble set of model parameters results in better Bayesian model averaging performance and better approximation of the true posterior distribution of model parameters. In this paper, we propose the diversity-enhanced probabilistic ensemble method with the adaptive uncertainty-guided ensemble learning strategy for better quantifying uncertainty and further improving the model robustness. Specifically, we construct the probabilistic ensemble model by building a Gaussian distribution of the model parameters for each ensemble component using Laplacian approximation in a post-processing manner. Then a mixture of Gaussian model is established with learnable and refinable parameters in an EM-like algorithm. During ensemble training, we leverage the uncertainty estimated from previous models as guidance when training the next one such that the new model will focus more on the less explored regions by previous models. Various experiments including out-of-distribution detection and image classification under distributional shifts have demonstrated better uncertainty estimation and improved model generalization ability for our proposed method. 
  TL;DR:  To tackle the multi-mention entity link problem, we propose a novel method, consisting of a context-entity joint feature extraction module, a multimodal learning framework, and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method with the pairwise training.   Abstract:   
 Entity linking, bridging mentions in the contexts with their corresponding entities in the knowledge bases, has attracted wide attention due to many potential applications. Previous methods mainly focus on the single-mention scenarios and neglect the scenarios where multiple mentions exist simultaneously in the same context, which limits their performance. In fact, such multi-mention scenarios are pretty common in public datasets and real-world applications. To solve this challenge, we first propose a joint feature extraction module to learn the representations of context and entity candidates, which can take the multimodal information into consideration. Then, we design a pairwise training scheme (for training) and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method (for testing) to model the potential connections between different mentions. We evaluate our method on a public dataset and a self-constructed dataset, NYTimes-MEL, under both the text-only and multimodal settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can largely outperform the state-of-the-art methods, especially in multi-mention scenarios. 
    Abstract:   
 In the emerging paradigm of Federated Learning (FL), large amount of clients such as mobile devices are used to train possibly high-dimensional models on their respective data. Combing (\textit{dimension-wise}) adaptive gradient methods (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad) with FL has been an active direction, which is shown to outperform traditional SGD based FL in many cases. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training federated deep neural networks, and propose a novel FL framework which further introduces \emph{layer-wise} adaptivity to the local model updates to accelerate the convergence of adaptive FL methods. Our framework includes two variants based on two recent locally adaptive federated learning algorithms. Theoretically, we provide a convergence analysis of our layer-wise FL methods, coined Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB, which match the convergence rate of state-of-the-art results in adaptive FL and exhibits linear speedup in terms of the number of workers. Experimental results on various datasets and models, under both IID and non-IID local data settings, show that both Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB achieve faster convergence speed and better generalization performance, compared to various recent adaptive FL methods. 
  TL;DR:  We propose approximate Bayes optimal selection of pseudo-samples in self-training to address the confirmation bias.   Abstract:   
 Semi-supervised learning by self-training heavily relies on pseudo-label selection (PLS). The selection often depends on the initial model fit on labeled data. Early overfitting might thus be propagated to the final model by selecting instances with overconfident but erroneous predictions, often referred to as confirmation bias. This paper introduces BPLS, a Bayesian framework for PLS that aims to mitigate this issue. At its core lies a criterion for selecting instances to label: an analytical approximation of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We derive this selection criterion by proving Bayes optimality of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We further overcome computational hurdles by approximating the criterion analytically. Its relation to the marginal likelihood allows us to come up with an approximation based on Laplace's method and the Gaussian integral. We empirically assess BPLS for parametric generalized linear and non-parametric generalized additive models on simulated and real-world data. When faced with high-dimensional data prone to overfitting, BPLS outperforms traditional PLS methods.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we present a first attempt to learn probabilistic multi-dimensional classifiers which are interpretable, accurate, scalable and capable of handling mixed data.   Abstract:   
 Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) can be employed in a range of applications where one needs to predict multiple class variables for each given instance. Arguably, probabilistic MDC has been studied seldom when compared to its single class variable counterpart. Existing MDC methods often suffer from at least one of inaccuracy, scalability, limited use to certain types of data, hardness of interpretation or lack of probabilistic (uncertainty) estimations. To our best knowledge, this paper is a first attempt to address all these disadvantages simultaneously. We propose a formal framework for probabilistic MDC in which learning an optimal multi-dimensional classifier can be decomposed, without loss of generality, into learning a set of (smaller) single-variable multi-class probabilistic classifiers and a directed acyclic graph. Current and future developments of both probabilistic classification and graphical model learning can directly enhance our framework, which is flexible and provably optimal. A collection of experiments is conducted to highlight the usefulness of this MDC framework. 
    Abstract:   
 Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a popular method for black-box optimization, which relies on uncertainty as part of its decision-making process when deciding which experiment to perform next. However, not much work has addressed the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the BO algorithm and to what extent calibrated uncertainties improve the ability to find the global optimum. In this work, we provide an extensive study of the relationship between the BO performance (regret) and uncertainty calibration for popular surrogate models and acquisition functions, and compare them across both synthetic and real-world experiments. Our results show that Gaussian Processes, and more surprisingly, Deep Ensembles are strong surrogate models. Our results further show a positive association between calibration error and regret, but interestingly, this association disappears when we control for the type of surrogate model in the analysis. We also study the effect of recalibration and demonstrate that it generally does not lead to improved regret. Finally, we provide theoretical justification for why uncertainty calibration might be difficult to combine with BO due to the small sample sizes commonly used.

  TL;DR:  Our paper introduces a new pairwise conditional independence testing algorithm.   Abstract:   
 A simple approach to test for conditional independence of two random vectors given a third random vector is to simultaneously test for conditional independence of every pair of components of the two random vectors given the third random vector. In this work, we show that conditioning on additional components of the two random vectors that are independent given the third one increases the tests' effect sizes while leaving the validity of the overall approach unchanged. Up to the effective reduction of the sample size due to enlarging the conditioning sets, these larger effect sizes lead to higher statistical power. We leverage this result to derive a practical pairwise testing algorithm that first chooses tests with a relatively large effect size and then does the actual testing. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms standard pairwise independence testing and other existing methods if the dependence within the two random vectors is sufficiently high. 
  TL;DR:  A formal analysis of algorithms that would lead to safe shutdown behaviour   Abstract:   
 How can humans stay in control of advanced artificial intelligence systems? One proposal is corrigibility, which requires the agent to follow the instructions of a human overseer, without inappropriately influencing them. In this paper, we provide the first formal definition of corrigibility, and show that it implies appropriate shutdown behavior, retention of human autonomy, and safety in low-stakes settings. We also analyse the related concepts of non-obstruction and counterfactual obedience, as well as three previously proposed corrigibility algorithms, and one new algorithm. 
    Abstract:   
 Under a simplified data model, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of learning from data that have an underlying low-rank tensor structure in both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the supervised setting, we provide an analysis of a Ridge classifier (with high regularization parameter) with and without knowledge of the low-rank structure of the data. Our results quantify analytically the gain in misclassification errors achieved by exploiting the low-rank structure for denoising purposes, as opposed to treating data as mere vectors. We further provide a similar analysis in the context of clustering, thereby quantifying the exact performance gap between tensor methods and standard approaches which treat data as simple vectors. 
    Abstract:   
 Tensor ring (TR) decomposition has recently received increased attention due to its superior expressive performance for high-order tensors. However, the applicability of traditional TR decomposition algorithms to real-world applications is hindered by prevalent large data sizes, missing entries, and corruption with outliers. In this work, we propose a scalable and robust TR decomposition algorithm capable of handling large-scale tensor data with missing entries and gross corruptions. We first develop a novel auto-weighted steepest descent method that can adaptively fill the missing entries and identify the outliers during the decomposition process. Further, taking advantage of the tensor ring model, we develop a novel fast Gram matrix computation (FGMC) approach and a randomized subtensor sketching (RStS) strategy which yield significant reduction in storage and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing TR decomposition methods in the presence of outliers, and runs significantly faster than existing robust tensor completion algorithms. 
  TL;DR:  Pruning networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude can be pruned to obtain small networks of comparable sizes that have low test error and good calibration.   Abstract:   
 Pruning deep neural networks is a widely used strategy to alleviate the computational burden in machine learning. Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that pruned models retain very high accuracy even with a tiny fraction of parameters. However, relatively little work has gone into characterising the small pruned networks obtained, beyond a measure of their accuracy. In this paper, we study small networks obtained via the iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) procedure on data with label noise. We observe empirically that, for a given task, IMP tends to converge to networks of comparable sizes even when starting from full networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude. We analyse the best pruned models in a controlled experimental setup and show that their number of parameters reflects task difficulty and that they are much better than full networks at capturing the true conditional probability distribution of the labels. On real data, we similarly observe that pruned models are less prone to overconfident predictions. Our results suggest that pruned models obtained via IMP not only have advantageous computational properties but also provide a better representation of uncertainty in learning. 
    Abstract:   
 Control variates can be a powerful tool to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators, but constructing effective control variates can be challenging when the number of samples is small. In this paper, we show that when a large number of related integrals need to be computed, it is possible to leverage the similarity between these integration tasks to improve performance even when the number of samples per task is very small. Our approach, called meta learning CVs (Meta-CVs), can be used for up to hundreds or thousands of tasks. Our empirical assessment indicates that Meta-CVs can lead to significant variance reduction in such settings, and our theoretical analysis establishes general conditions under which Meta-CVs can be successfully trained. 
  TL;DR:  We propose algorithms to bound error of any PINN solution to linear ODEs, certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear PDEs. Only residual information and equation structure are required. No network architecture assumptions needed.   Abstract:   
 Neural networks are universal approximators and are studied for their use in solving differential equations. However, a major criticism is the lack of error bounds for obtained solutions. This paper proposes a technique to rigorously evaluate the error bound of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on most linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The error bound is based purely on equation structure and residual information and does not depend on assumptions of how well the networks are trained. We propose algorithms that bound the error efficiently. Some proposed algorithms provide tighter bounds than others at the cost of longer run time.

    Abstract:   
 Randomized experiments (REs) are the cornerstone for treatment effect evaluation. However, due to the practical considerations, REs may encounter difficulty recruiting sufficient patients. Historical controls (HCs) may supplement REs to boost estimation efficiency. Yet, it is possible that there is incomparability between HCs and CCs, resulting in misleading treatment effect evaluation. We introduce a new bias function to measure the difference between the outcome mean function between HCs and REs. We show that the ANCOVA model augmented the bias function for HCs renders a consistent estimator of the average treatment effect, regardless whether the ANCOVA model is correct or not. To accommodate possibly different structure of the ANCOVA model and the bias function, we propose a double penalty integration estimator (DPIE) with different penalization terms for the two functions. With an appropriate choice of penalty parameters, our DPIE ensures consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality even in the presence of model misspecification. DPIE is at least as efficient as the estimator derived from REs alone, which is validated through both theoretical and experimental results.

  TL;DR:  We porpose a framewok and an algorithm to include local knowledge in boosting, with thoeretical and experiemental guarantees.   Abstract:   
 Ensemble methods are a very diverse family of algorithms with a wide range of applications. One of the most commonly used is boosting, with the prominent Adaboost. Adaboost relies on greedily learning base classifiers that rectify the error from previous iteration. Then, it combines them through a weighted majority vote, based on their quality on the learning set. In this paper, we propose a supervised binary classification framework that propagates the local knowledge acquired during the boosting iterations to the prediction function. Based on this general framework, we introduce SamBA, an interpretable greedy ensemble method designed for fat datasets with a large number of dimensions and a small number of samples. SamBA learns local classifiers and combines them, using a similarity function, to optimize its efficiency in data extraction. We provide a theoretical analysis of SamBA, yielding convergence and generalization guarantees. In addition, we highlight SamBA's empirical behavior in an extensive experimental analysis on both real biological and generated datasets, comparing it to state-of-the-art ensemble methods and similarity-based approaches. 
  TL;DR:  We address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue   Abstract:   
 Proper confidence calibration of deep neural networks is essential in safety-critical tasks for reliable predictions. Miscalibration can lead to model over-confidence and/or under-confidence; i.e., the predicted confidence can be greater or less than model accuracy. Recent studies have highlighted the over-confidence issue by introducing calibration techniques and demonstrated success on various tasks. However, miscalibration through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper, we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions. Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence. We report extensive experiments that show that our proposed methods substantially outperform existing calibration techniques. We also validate the automatic failure detection of the proposed calibration technique using our class-wise miscalibration score with a risk-coverage curve. Results show that our methods significantly improve failure detection as well as trustworthiness of the model.

  TL;DR:  Better certified segmentation leveraging randomized smoothing as well as off-the-shelf denoising diffusion and segmentation models.   Abstract:   
 The robustness of image segmentation has been an important research topic in the past few years as segmentation models have reached production-level accuracy. However, like classification models, segmentation models can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which hinders their use in critical-decision systems like healthcare or autonomous driving. Recently, randomized smoothing has been proposed to certify segmentation predictions by adding Gaussian noise to the input to obtain theoretical guarantees. Nonetheless, this method exhibits a trade-off between the amount of added noise and the level of certification achieved. In this paper, we address the problem of certifying segmentation prediction using a combination of randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our experiments show that combining randomized smoothing and diffusion models significantly improves certified robustness, with results indicating a mean improvement of 21 points in accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-Context and Cityscapes public datasets. Our method is independent of the selected segmentation model and does not need any additional specialized training procedure. Our pipeline and code will be made publicly available online.

    Abstract:   
 Text classifiers built on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question-answering. However, these text classifiers sometimes make uncertain predictions, which challenges their trustworthiness during deployment in practical applications. Much effort has been devoted to designing various probes in order to understand what PLMs capture. But few works have explored factors influencing PLM-based classifiers' predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework CUE for interpreting uncertainties of PLM-based models' predictions. In particular, we first map PLM-encoded representations to a latent space via a variational auto-encoder. We then generate text representations by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in predictive uncertainty. By comparing the predictive uncertainty difference between the perturbed text representation and the original text representation, we are able to identify the latent dimensions that cause uncertainty and thus trace back to input features that lead to uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for linguistic acceptability classification, emotion classification, and natural language inference show the feasibility of our proposed framework.

    Abstract:   
 The Right to Explanation is an important regulatory principle which allows individuals to request actionable explanations for algorithmic decisions. However, several technical challenges arise when providing such actionable explanations in practice. For instance, models are periodically retrained to handle dataset shifts, and this may in turn invalidate some of the previously prescribed explanations thus rendering them unactionable. But, it is unclear if and when such invalidations occur, and what factors determine explanation stability i.e., if an explanation remains unchanged amidst model retraining due to dataset shifts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned gaps and provide one of the first theoretical and empirical characterizations of the factors influencing explanation stability. To this end, we conduct rigorous theoretical analysis to demonstrate that model curvature and robustness, weight decay parameters, and the magnitude of the dataset shift are key factors that determine the extent of explanation (in)stability. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets not only validates our theoretical results, but also demonstrates that the aforementioned factors dramatically impact the stability of explanations produced by various state-of-the-art methods. 
  TL;DR:  We propose two novel improvable gap balancing algorithms for multi-task learning, instead of the classic loss balancing strategy.   Abstract:   
 In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient balancing has recently attracted more research interest than loss balancing since it often leads to better performance. However, loss balancing is much more efficient than gradient balancing, and thus it is still worth further exploration in MTL. Note that prior studies typically ignore that there exist varying improvable gaps across multiple tasks, where the improvable gap per task is defined as the distance between the current training progress and desired final training progress. Therefore, after loss balancing, the performance imbalance still arises in many cases. In this paper, following the loss balancing framework, we propose two novel improvable gap balancing (IGB) algorithms for MTL: one takes a simple heuristic, and the other (for the first time) deploys deep reinforcement learning for MTL. Particularly, instead of directly balancing the losses in MTL, both algorithms choose to dynamically assign task weights for improvable gap balancing. Moreover, since IGB is shown to be complementary to gradient balancing, we also provide a fusion paradigm to combine both loss balancing and gradient balancing for MTL. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IGB algorithms lead to the best results in MTL via loss balancing and achieve further improvements when combined with gradient balancing. 
  TL;DR:  We propose a version of a security game that takes into account a possibility of a two-phase attack.   Abstract:   
 A standard model of a security game assumes a one-off assault during which the attacker cannot update their strategy even if new actionable insights are gained in the process. In this paper, we propose a version of a security game that takes into account a possibility of a two-phase attack. Specifically, in the first phase, the attacker makes a preliminary move to gain extra information about this particular instance of the game. Based on this information, the attacker chooses an optimal concluding move. We derive a compact-form mixed-integer linear program that computes an optimal strategy of the defender. Our simulation shows that this strategy mitigates serious losses incurred to the defender by a two-phase attack while still protecting well against less sophisticated attackers. 
  TL;DR:  We prove a high-probability bound for the instantaneous swap regret with respect to the randmoness of both learner and adversaries.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we study a multi-agent bandit problem in an unknown general-sum game repeated for a number of rounds~(i.e., learning in a black-box game with bandit feedback), where a set of agents have no information about the underlying game structure and cannot observe each other's actions and rewards. In each round, each agent needs to play an arm~(i.e., action) from a (possibly different) arm set~(i.e., action set), and \emph{only} receives the reward of the \emph{played} arm that is affected by other agents' actions. The objective of each agent is to minimize her own cumulative swap regret, where the swap regret is a generic performance measure for online learning algorithms. We are the first to give a near-optimal high-probability swap-regret upper bound based on a refined martingale analysis for the exponential-weighting-based algorithms with the implicit exploration technique, which can further bound the expected swap regret instead of the pseudo-regret studied in the literature. It is also guaranteed that correlated equilibria can be achieved in a polynomial number of rounds if the algorithm is played by all agents. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to verify the performance of the studied algorithm. 
  TL;DR:  We identify experimental artifacts in OOD detection benchmark studies, so we question the reliability of OOD detector rankings.   Abstract:   
 Reliable detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is becoming a critical requirement for machine learning systems deployed in safety-critical applications. Recently, many OOD detectors have been developed in the literature, and their performance has been evaluated using empirical studies based on well-established benchmark datasets. However, these studies do not provide a conclusive recommendation because the performance of OOD detection depends on the benchmark datasets. In this work, we want to question the reliability of the OOD detection performance numbers obtained from many of these empirical experiments. We report several experimental conditions that are not controlled and lead to significant changes in OOD detector performance and rankings of OOD methods. These include the technicalities related to how the DNN was trained (such as seed, train/test split, etc.), which do not change the accuracy of closed-set DNN models but may significantly change the performance of OOD detection methods that rely on representation from these DNNs. We performed extensive sensitivity studies to quantify the instability of OOD performance measures due to unintuitive experimental artifacts, which need to be more rigorously controlled and accounted for in many current OOD experiments. Experimental studies in OOD detection should improve methodological standards regarding experiment control and replication. 
  TL;DR:  We give the first algorithm to have provable false positive rate for online change point detection with heavy tailed data   Abstract:   
 We study algorithms for online sequential change-point detection, where samples are presented one at a time, a change in the underlying mean must be detected as early as possible, and the data distribution could be heavy tailed. We present an algorithm based on clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that works even if we only assume that the second moment of the data generating process is bounded. We derive guarantees on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate (FPR) over the family of all distributions with bounded second moment. Thus, our method is the first online change point detection mechanism that guarantees finite-sample FPR, even if the underlying observations are drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. The technical contribution of our paper is to show that clipped-SGD can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provide confidence bounds at all confidence values. We use this robust estimate via a simple union bound and construct a sequential change-point algorithm with finite-sample FPR guarantees. We further demonstrate through simulations that our algorithm works well in a variety of situations whether the underlying data are heavy-tailed, light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete. No other algorithm achieves bounded FPR theoretically or empirically, over all the settings we study simultaneously.

  TL;DR:  This paper describes a unified active query framework that can be applied to any problem which involves learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity.   Abstract:   
 Active learning is commonly used to train label-efficient models by adaptively selecting the most informative queries. However, most active learning strategies are designed to either learn a representation of the data (e.g., embedding or metric learning) or perform well on a task (e.g., classification) on the data. However, many machine learning tasks involve a combination of both representation learning and a task-specific goal. Motivated by this, we propose a novel unified query framework that can be applied to any problem in which a key component is learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity. Our approach builds on similarity or nearest neighbor (NN) queries which seek to select samples that result in improved embeddings. The queries consist of a reference and a set of objects, with an oracle selecting the object most similar (i.e., nearest) to the reference. In order to reduce the number of solicited queries, they are chosen adaptively according to an information theoretic criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on two tasks -- active metric learning and active classification -- using a variety of synthetic and real world datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that actively selected NN queries outperform recently developed active triplet selection methods in a deep metric learning setting. Further, we show that in classification, actively selecting class labels can be reformulated as a process of selecting the most informative NN query, allowing direct application of our method. 
    Abstract:   
 One of the objectives of continual learning is to prevent catastrophic forgetting in learning multiple tasks sequentially, and the existing solutions have been driven by the conceptualization of the plasticity-stability dilemma. However, the convergence of continual learning for each sequential task is less studied so far. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of memory-based continual learning with stochastic gradient descent and empirical evidence that training current tasks causes the cumulative degradation of previous tasks. We propose an adaptive method for nonconvex continual learning (NCCL), which adjusts step sizes of both previous and current tasks with the gradients. The proposed method can achieve the same convergence rate as the SGD method when the catastrophic forgetting term which we define in the paper is suppressed at each iteration. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of continual learning over existing methods for several image classification tasks. 
  TL;DR:  We propose a new robust score-based quickest change detection algorithm that can be applied to unnormalized models.   Abstract:   
 Detecting an abrupt and persistent change in the underlying distribution of online data streams is an important problem in many applications. This paper proposes a new robust score-based algorithm called RSCUSUM, which can be applied to unnormalized models and addresses the issue of unknown post-change distributions. RSCUSUM replaces the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the Fisher divergence between pre- and post-change distributions for computational efficiency in unnormalized statistical models and introduces a notion of the ``least favorable'' distribution for robust change detection. The algorithm and its theoretical analysis are demonstrated through simulation studies. 
    Abstract:   
 Many \textit{event sequence} data exhibit mutually exciting or inhibiting patterns. Reliable detection of such temporal dependency is crucial for scientific investigation. The \textit{de facto} model is the Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP), whose impact function naturally encodes a causal structure in Granger causality. However, the vast majority of existing methods use direct or nonlinear transform of \textit{standard} MHP intensity with constant baseline, inconsistent with real-world data. Under irregular and unknown heterogeneous intensity, capturing temporal dependency is hard as one struggles to distinguish the effect of mutual interaction from that of intensity fluctuation. In this paper, we address the short-term temporal dependency detection issue. We show the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for cross-impact from MHP has an error that can not be eliminated but may be reduced by order of magnitude, using heterogeneous intensity not of the target HP but of the interacting HP. Then we proposed a robust and computationally-efficient method modified from MLE that does not rely on the prior estimation of the heterogeneous intensity and is thus applicable in a data-limited regime (e.g., few-shot, no repeated observations). Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones by notable margins, with highlighted novel applications in neuroscience.

  TL;DR:  This paper applies copulas to model unobserved dependencies between times of event and censorship in survival analysis, reducing bias in learned survival curves.   Abstract:   
 Survival datasets describe a set of instances (e.g., patients), and provide, for each, either the time until an event (e.g., death), or the censoring time (e.g., when lost to follow-up ‚Äì which is a lower bound on the time until the event). We consider the challenge of survival prediction: learning, from such data, a predictive model that can produce an individual survival distribution for a novel instance. Many contemporary methods of survival prediction implicitly assume that the event and censoring distributions are independent conditional on the instance‚Äôs covariates ‚Äì a strong assumption that is difficult to verify (as we observe only one outcome for each instance) and which can induce significant bias when it does not hold. This paper presents a parametric model of survival that extends modern non-linear survival analysis by relaxing the assumption of conditional independence. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate that our approach significantly improves estimates of survival distributions compared to the standard that assumes conditional independence in the data.

  TL;DR:  This paper gives a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to count the number of directed acyclic graphs in a Markov equivalence class under background knowledge constraint.   Abstract:   
    Abstract:   
 Significant progress has been made in developing identification and estimation techniques for missing data problems where modeling assumptions can be described via a directed acyclic graph. The validity of results using such techniques rely on the assumptions encoded by the graph holding true; however, verification of these assumptions has not received sufficient attention in prior work. In this paper, we provide new insights on the testable implications of three broad classes of missing data graphical models, and design goodness-of-fit tests for them. The classes of models explored are: sequential missing-at-random and missing-not-at-random models which can be used for modeling longitudinal studies with dropout/censoring, and a no self-censoring model which can be applied to cross-sectional studies and surveys. 
  TL;DR:  We introduce a conditional optimism-based exploration method for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.   Abstract:   
 Efficient exploration is critical in cooperative deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we propose an exploration method that efficiently encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of the theoretically justified tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees). The high-level intuition is that to perform optimism-based exploration, agents would achieve cooperative strategies if each agent's optimism estimate captures a structured dependency relationship with other agents. At each node (i.e., action) of the search tree, UCT performs optimism-based exploration using a bonus derived by conditioning on the visitation count of its parent node. We provide a perspective to view MARL as tree search iterations and develop a method called Conditionally Optimistic Exploration (COE). We assume agents take actions following a sequential order, and consider nodes at the same depth of the search tree as actions of one individual agent. COE computes each agent's state-action value estimate with an optimistic bonus derived from the visitation count of the state and joint actions taken by agents up to the current agent. COE is adaptable to any value decomposition method for centralized training with decentralized execution. Experiments across various cooperative MARL benchmarks show that COE outperforms current state-of-the-art exploration methods on hard-exploration tasks.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we propose a simple multi-modal framework for crystalline materials, which fuse both graph structural and textual representation together to improve property prediction accuracy.   Abstract:   
 Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate prediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e crystal graph structure, where they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture important global periodic structural information like space group number, crystal symmetry, rotational information etc, which influence different crystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials to model global structural information into graph structure to learn a more robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple multi- modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline materials. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe fusing textual representation with crystal graph structure provides consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own vanilla version. We are going to share the textual dataset, that we have curated for both the benchmark material databases with the community for future use. 
  TL;DR:  We connect calibration in regression and classification with the notion of parity (whether the next observation increases or decreases w.r.t. the current observation), and propose methods to produce parity calibrated predictions.   Abstract:   
 In a sequential prediction setting, a decision-maker may be primarily concerned with whether the continuous-valued future observation will increase or decrease compared to the current one, rather than the actual value of the future observation. We introduce the parity calibration framework, where the goal is to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates for the increase-decrease event in a timeseries. While these ``parity" probabilities can be extracted from a distributional forecast, such a strategy does not work as expected and can have poor practical performance. We then observe that although the original task was regression, parity calibration can be expressed as binary calibration. Drawing on this connection, we use a recently proposed online binary calibration method to achieve parity calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real-world case studies in epidemiology, weather forecasting, and model-based control in nuclear fusion.

  TL;DR:  This paper introduces a contrastive learning framework for deep graph matching.   Abstract:   
 Deep graph matching techniques have shown promising results in recent years. In this work, we cast deep graph matching as a contrastive learning task and introduce a new objective function for contrastive mapping to exploit the relationships between matches and non-matches. To this end, we develop a hardness attention mechanism to select negative samples which captures the relatedness and informativeness of positive and negative samples. Further, we propose a novel deep graph matching framework, \emph{Stable Graph Matching} (StableGM), which incorporates Sinkhorn ranking into a stable marriage algorithm to efficiently compute one-to-one node correspondences between graphs. We prove that the proposed objective function for contrastive matching is both positive and negative informative, offering theoretical guarantees to achieve dual-optimality in graph matching. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by conducting experiments on standard graph matching benchmarks. 
  TL;DR:  Top down inspired end to end method for hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasting   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic, hierarchically coherent forecasting is a key problem in many practical forecasting applications -- the goal is to obtain coherent probabilistic predictions for a large number of time series arranged in a pre-specified tree hierarchy. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep probabilistic model for hierarchical forecasting that is motivated by a classical top-down strategy. It jointly learns the distribution of the root time series, and the (dirichlet) proportions according to which each parent time-series is split among its children at any point in time. The resulting forecasts are naturally coherent, and provide probabilistic predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We experiment on several public datasets and demonstrate significant improvements of up to 26% on most datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we also provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to the more traditional bottom-up modeling.

 In this paper, we present FLASH, a framework which addresses for the first time the central AutoML problem of Combined Algorithm Selection and HyperParameter (HP) Optimization (CASH) in the context of Federated Learning (FL). To limit training cost, FLASH incrementally adapts the set of algorithms to train based on their projected loss rates, while supporting decentralized (federated) implementation of the embedded hyperparameter optimization (HPO), model selection and loss calculation problems. We provide a theoretical analysis of the training and validation loss under FLASH, and their tradeoff with the training cost measured as the data wasted in training sub-optimal algorithms. The bounds depend on the degree of dissimilarity between the datasets of the clients, a result of FL restriction that client datasets remain private. Through extensive experimental investigation on several datasets, we evaluate three variants of FLASH, and show that FLASH performs close to centralized CASH methods.

  TL;DR:  We propose to use latent space energy-based model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties and optimize molecule properties by sampling with gradual distribution shifting.   Abstract:   
 Generation of molecules with desired chemical and biological properties such as high drug-likeness, high binding affinity to target proteins, is critical for drug discovery. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties. Our model assumes an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space. Conditional on the latent vector, the molecule and its properties are modeled by a molecule generation model and a property regression model respectively. To search for molecules with desired properties, we propose a sampling with gradual distribution shifting (SGDS) algorithm, so that after learning the model initially on the training data of existing molecules and their properties, the proposed algorithm gradually shifts the model distribution towards the region supported by molecules with desired values of properties. Our experiments show that our method achieves competitive performances on various molecule design tasks.

  TL;DR:  This paper shows that bidirectional attention is equivalent to continuous bag of words with mixture-of-experts weights, and builds on this equivalence to argue about linear structures on the embeddings and give extensions to sequence and tabular data   Abstract:   
 Bidirectional attention has emerged as a key component of modern large language models, which includes self-attention mechanism, position encodings, and the MLM objective. Despite its widespread use, few studies have examined the inductive bias underlying bidirectional attention: What sets bidirectional attention models apart from its non-attention predecessors like CBOW? Are they completely different model classes? In this paper, we show that, upon reparameterization, bidirectional attention---namely training single-head single-layer attention with position encodings using the MLM objective---is equivalent to CBOW with mixture-of-experts weights, hence bidirectional attention as mixture of continuous word experts. This viewpoint enables us to characterize when embeddings from bidirectional attention exhibit a similar linear structure to its non-attention predecessors (e.g., word2vec, GloVe). It also suggests immediate extensions of bidirectional attention beyond text, including general non-textual sequence data and tabular data. Empirically, we demonstrate the attention-based approach to tabular data improves out-of-distribution generalization. 
    Abstract:   
 Off-policy methods are the basis of a large number of effective Policy Optimization (PO) algorithms. In this setting, Importance Sampling (IS) is typically employed as a what-if analysis tool, with the goal of estimating the performance of a target policy, given samples collected with a different behavioral policy. However, in Monte Carlo simulation, IS represents a variance minimization approach. In this field, a suitable behavioral distribution is employed for sampling, allowing diminishing the variance of the estimator below the one achievable when sampling from the target distribution. In this paper, we analyze IS in these two guises in the context of PO. We provide a novel view of off-policy PO, showing a connection between the policy improvement and variance minimization objectives. Then, we illustrate how minimizing the off-policy variance can, in some circumstances, lead to a policy improvement, with the advantage, compared with direct off-policy learning, of implicitly enforcing a trust region. Finally, we present numerical simulations on continuous RL benchmarks, with a particular focus on the robustness to small batch sizes. 
    Abstract:   
 Black-box adversarial attacks designing adversarial examples for unseen deep neural networks (DNNs) have received great attention over the past years. However, the underlying factors driving the transferability of black-box adversarial examples still lack a thorough understanding. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the role of the generalization behavior of the substitute classifier used for generating adversarial examples in the transferability of the attack scheme to unobserved DNN classifiers. To do this, we apply the max-min adversarial example game framework and show the importance of the generalization properties of the substitute DNN from training to test data in the success of the black-box attack scheme in application to different DNN classifiers. We prove theoretical generalization bounds on the difference between the attack transferability rates on training and test samples. Our bounds suggest that operator norm-based regularization methods could improve the transferability of the designed adversarial examples. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments showing the role of the substitute network's generalization in generating transferable adversarial examples. Our empirical results indicate the power of Lipschitz regularization and early stopping methods in improving the transferability of designed adversarial examples. 
    Abstract:   
 In many real-world problems, the learning agent needs to learn a problem‚Äôs abstractions and solution simultaneously. However, most such abstractions need to be designed and refined by hand for different problems and domains of application. This paper presents a novel top-down approach for constructing state abstractions while carrying out reinforcement learning (RL). Starting with state variables and a simulator, it presents a novel domain-independent approach for dynamically computing an abstraction based on the dispersion of Q-values in abstract states as the agent continues acting and learning. Extensive empirical evaluation on multiple domains and problems shows that this approach automatically learns abstractions that are finely-tuned to the problem, yield powerful sample efficiency, and result in the RL agent significantly outperforming existing approaches. 
    Abstract:   
 When perceiving the world from multiple viewpoints, humans have the ability to reason about the complete objects in a compositional manner even when the object is completely occluded from partial viewpoints. Meanwhile, humans can imagine the novel views after observing multiple viewpoints. The remarkable recent advance in multiview object-centric learning leaves some problems: 1) the partially or completely occluded shape of objects can not be well reconstructed. 2) the novel viewpoint prediction depends on expensive viewpoint annotations rather than implicit view rules. This makes the agent fail to perform like humans. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative model for videos. To reconstruct the complete shape of the object accurately, we enhance the disentanglement between different latent representations: view latent representations are jointly inferred based on the Transformer and then cooperate with the sequential extension of Slot Attention to learn object-centric representations. The model also achieves the new ability: Gaussian processes are employed as priors of view latent variables for generation and novel-view prediction without viewpoint annotations. Experiments on multiple specifically designed synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed model can 1) make the video decomposition, 2) reconstruct the complete shapes of objects, and 3) make the novel viewpoint prediction without viewpoint annotations.

  TL;DR:  This paper proposes a regularized online optimization problem with concave and DR-submodular regularizers, and presents efficient algorithms for both cases with theoretical performance guarantees.   Abstract:   
 The utilization of online optimization techniques is prevalent in many fields of artificial intelligence, enabling systems to continuously learn and adjust to their surroundings. This paper outlines a regularized online optimization problem, where the regularizer is defined on the average of the actions taken. The objective is to maximize the sum of rewards and the regularizer value while adhering to resource constraints, where the reward function is assumed to be DR-submodular. Both concave and DR-submodular regularizers are analyzed. Concave functions are useful in describing the impartiality of decisions, while DR-submodular functions can be employed to represent the overall effect of decisions on all relevant parties. We have developed two algorithms for each of the concave and DR-submodular regularizers. These algorithms are easy to implement, efficient, and produce sublinear regret in both cases. The performance of the proposed algorithms and regularizers has been verified through numerical experiments in the context of internet advertising. 
  TL;DR:  This is the first work that considers to protect the privacy of a Gaussian process regression model via secret sharing.   Abstract:   
 Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a non-parametric model that has been used in many real-world applications that involve sensitive personal data (e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.) from multiple data owners. To fully and securely exploit the value of different data sources, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving GPR method based on secret sharing (SS), a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technique. In contrast to existing studies that protect the data privacy of GPR via homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or federated learning, our proposed method is more practical and can be used to preserve the data privacy of both the model inputs and outputs for various data-sharing scenarios (e.g., horizontally/vertically-partitioned data). However, it is non-trivial to directly apply SS on the conventional GPR algorithm, as it includes some operations whose accuracy and/or efficiency have not been well-enhanced in the current SMPC protocol. To address this issue, we derive a new SS-based exponentiation operation through the idea of ‚Äúconfusion-correction‚Äù and constructing a privacy-preserving matrix inversion algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition. More importantly, we theoretically analyze the communication cost and the security of the proposed SS-based operations. Empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that our proposed method can achieve reasonable accuracy and efficiency under the premise of preserving data privacy. 
  TL;DR:  We introcued a novel universal graph contrastive learning by defining a Laplacian peturbation.   Abstract:   
 Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is an effective method for discovering meaningful patterns in graph data. By evaluating diverse augmentations of the graph, GCL learns discriminative representations and provides a flexible and scalable mechanism for various graph mining tasks. This paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework based on Laplacian perturbation. The framework employs a complex Hermitian adjacency matrix which enables the application of a novel graph Laplacian. Unlike existing GCL methods, the proposed framework is not restricted to specific graph types and enjoys a wider range of applicability. We demonstrate that a spectral graph convolution based on the Laplacian extracts the representations of diverse graph types successfully. Our extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets, covering multiple graph types, show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both node classification and link sign prediction tasks. 
  TL;DR:  We show formally why and when incorporating tiered background knowledge into equivalence classes of DAGs leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency.   Abstract:   
 Equivalence classes of DAGs (represented by CPDAGs) may be too large to provide useful causal information. Here, we address incorporating tiered background knowledge yielding restricted equivalence classes represented by ‚Äòtiered MPDAGs‚Äô. Tiered knowledge leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency: We show that construction of tiered MPDAGs only requires application of Meeks 1st rule, and that tiered MPDAGs (unlike general MPDAGs) are chain graphs with chordal components. This entails simplifications e.g. of determining valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Further, we characterise when one tiered ordering is more informative than another, providing insights into useful aspects of background knowledge. 
  TL;DR:  We propose a novel method for handling long range dependencies in neural policies for RDDL RMDPs   Abstract:   
 We focus on the learning of generalized neural policies for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) expressed in RDDL. Recent work first converts the instances of a relational domain into an instance graph, and then trains a Graph Attention Network (GAT) of fixed depth with parameters shared across instances to learn a state representation, which can be decoded to get the policy Sharma et al. [2022]. Unfortunately, this approach struggles to learn policies that exploit long-range dependencies -- a fact we formally prove in this paper. As a remedy, we first construct a novel influence graph characterized by edges capturing one-step influence (dependence) between nodes based on the transition model. We then define influence distance between two nodes as the shortest path between them in this graph -- a feature we exploit to represent long-range dependencies. We show that our architecture, referred to as Symbolic Influence Network (SINet), with its distance-based features, does not suffer from the representational issues faced by earlier approaches. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that we are competitive with existing baselines on 12 standard IPPC domains, and perform significantly better on six additional domains (including IPPC variants), designed to test a model's capability in capturing long-range dependencies. Further analysis shows that SINet automatically learns to focus on nodes that have key information for representing policies that capture long-range dependencies. 
  TL;DR:  We consider bandit problems where arms return rewards sporadically, and examine interesting approximations that speed up existing best arm algorithms.   Abstract:   
 We consider the best arm identification (BAI) problem in the stochastic multi-armed bandit framework where each arm has a tiny probability of realizing large rewards while with overwhelming probability the reward is zero. A key application of this framework is in online advertising where click rates of advertisements could be a fraction of a single percent and final conversion to sales, while highly profitable, may again be a small fraction of the click rates. Lately, algorithms for BAI problems have been developed that minimise sample complexity while providing statistical guarantees on the correct arm selection. As we observe, these algorithms can be computationally prohibitive. We exploit the fact that the reward process for each arm is well approximated by a Compound Poisson process to arrive at algorithms that are faster, with a small increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem in an asymptotic regime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward amounts increase to infinity. This helps illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm. It also sheds light on the underlying structure of the optimal BAI algorithms in the rare event setting.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we leverage constraint generation methods to obtain an efficient learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRCs).   Abstract:   
 High-dimensional} data is common in multiple areas, such as health care and genomics, where the number of features can be hundreds of thousands. In such scenarios, the large number of features often lead to inefficient learning. Constraint generation methods have recently enabled efficient learning of L1-regularized support vector machines (SVM). In this paper, we leverage such methods to obtain an efficient learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRC). The proposed iterative algorithm also provides a sequence of worst-case error probabilities and performs feature selection. Experiments on multiple high-dimensional datasets show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in high-dimensional scenarios. In addition, the worst-case error probability provides useful information about the classifier performance, and the features selected by the algorithm are competitive with the state-of-the-art.
