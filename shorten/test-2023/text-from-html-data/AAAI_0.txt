  Welcome to the AAAI 23 conference!  
 This year we welcome you to interact in person, online and remotely. In addition to in person events, registered attendees can participate at your convenience through prerecorded talk presentations and online forums.  
    For those arriving in person, please look for the main entrance to the South Building from Mount Vernon Place. If you are connecting from the Marriott Marquis, please see our Know Before You Go  page for detailed instructions.  
 For those who can’t be with us in person, you can participate in live talks remotely with your questions, or to deliver your talk. To access the conference content, go here for:  Technical Program; Bridges  , Tutorial and Lab Forum  ; and Workshops Program  (Access is specific to your registration type).  
 The Mobi conference planner will help you plan for interesting sessions, plan coffee breaks with friends, and help rearrange your travel if needed. To arrange your sessions, Mobi’s planner can help you search for interesting topics and talks by friends, come up with a schedule, and suggest options to fill in the gaps.  
  The purpose of the AAAI conference series  is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers.  
 Collaborative Bridge Theme  Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. Follow this link for some of the ways that you can participate in this year’s Bridge theme.   
 We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.
