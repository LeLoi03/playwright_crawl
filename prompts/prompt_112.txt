 HIS 2023 Theme:  Hybrid Approaches for Large Language Models and Generative AI  
 Join the feast of Hybrid Computational Intelligence researchers!  
 Welcome to the 23th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2023) online, 2023. Hybridization of intelligent systems is a promising research field of computational intelligence focusing on synergistic combinations of multiple approaches to develop the next generation of intelligent systems. A fundamental stimulus to the investigations of HIS is the awareness that combined approaches will be necessary if the remaining tough problems in Artificial Intelligence are to be solved.  
 The objectives of HIS 2023 are: to increase the awareness of the research community of the broad spectrum of hybrid techniques, to bring together AI researchers from around the world to present their cutting-edge results, to discuss the current trends in HIS research, to develop a collective vision of future opportunities, to establish international collaborative opportunities, and as a result to advance the state of the art of the field.  
 HIS 2023 will be a hybrid conference that will run fully in-person and fully virtually to take advantage of the best that the two modalities can offer. Besides regular paper presentations, the technical programme will include 8-10 plenary lectures and poster sessions. HIS 2023 Organising Committee also recognises the benefits of virtual conferences allowing participation at a cheaper rate. This allows a higher number of research scholars and students to attend. Selected authors will have the option to attend and present the papers virtually or present in one of the three venues in Europe and Asia.  
 We look forward to welcoming you online!

  Program 
 At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies are dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.  
 Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.  
 HLPP symposia provide a forum for discussion and research about such high-level approaches to parallel and distributed programming.  
 Topics  
 HLPP 2023 invites papers on all topics in high-level parallel programming, its tools and applications including, but not limited to, the following aspects:  
 High-level parallel programming and performance models (e.g. BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.) and tools 
  Declarative parallel and distributed programming methodologies based on functional, logical, data-flow, actor, and other paradigms 
  Applications of parallel and distributed systems using high-level languages and tools 
  Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods for parallel and distributed computing

 Submission  
 Papers submitted to HLPP 2023 must describe original research results and must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere else. As it is traditional for HLPP symposia, the accepted papers will be distributed at the symposium in draft proceedings, and revised papers will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming.  
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews by members of the international technical program committee. Papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation.  
 Manuscripts must be prepared with the Springer IJSS latex macro package using the single column option (\documentclass[smallextended]{svjour3}) and submitted via the EasyChair Conference Management System as one pdf file. The strict page limit for initial submission and camera-ready version is 20 pages in the aforementioned format.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the HLPP 2023 symposium and present the paper.  
 After the symposium the authors of the papers will have ample time to revise their papers and to incorporate both reviewer feedback and presentation feedback from the whole audience during the symposium.

 Welcome to the 30th iteration of the IEEE Hot Interconnects symposium. HotI30 will be held virtually.  
 IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core on-chip interconnects to those within systems clusters, and data centers. Leaders in industry and academia attend the conference to interact with individuals at the forefront of this field.  
 Our objective is to address the data center networking and the supercomputing communities. We hope you can join us and benefit not only from the content but also from the prime networking opportunities this event always offers.  
 Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its conferences. Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed. Diversity is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. Inclusion is the active engagement of Diversity and Equity. A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination.  
 For this reason, the IEEE Computer Society is firmly committed to team compositions in all sponsored activities, including but not limited to, technical committees, steering committees, conference organizations, standards committees, and ad hoc committees that display Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.  
 IEEE Computer Society meetings, conferences and workshops must provide a welcoming, open and safe environment, that embraces the value of every person, regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, religion, national origin, ancestry, or disability.

 2024 Conference Theme –  Can Interconnects Keep up with AI?   
 The explosion of AI and workloads related to machine learning and deep learning boggles the mind. Whether in massive data centers, edge locations, automobiles, or consumer appliances, AI stands to improve many tasks useful to people at work or at leisure. The demand for GPUs, DPUs, TPUs, and IPUs taxes the ability of their manufacturers to meet the market demand. Efficient utilization of these xPUs requires high speed and highly scalable interconnects. Whether between xPUs or between an xPU and memory, data transfer can easily become a bottleneck in computing efficiency.  
 In this edition of IEEE Hot Interconnects, we explore advances in interconnection networks that alleviate this bottleneck. Solutions including optical circuit switching, dense photonic data paths, high-performance fabrics, and more will expand from the specialized applications of HPC to the pervasive applications of AI and in the process will become more affordable. This year’s HotI will thus be captivatingly relevant.
