 About MEDES 2023    
 In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environments namely “digital ecosystems” connected to the web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them.  
 With the help of the computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its “digital components”, in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms.  
 Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.  
 The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to web technologies and resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end. The conference seeks related original research papers, industrial papers and proposals for demonstrations, and tutorials and workshops.  
 The conference is In collaboration with ACM SIGAPP and the Proceedings will be published and indexed by Springer CCIS  .

 MEDI 2023 CFP     
 Overview  
 The Twelfth International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.  
 Why Sousse?  
 The city is host to many international conferences and other important regional and international events. We have chosen Sousse to host the MEDI-2023 for its exoticism and modernity. The facilities for hosting conferences in the city have evolved, especially in terms of hotels and conference centers.  
 Medi 2023 will be Organized in Hotel Sousse Pearl Marriott Resort & Spa 5*  , Sousse- Tunisia  
 Sousse Pearl Marriott Resort & Spa is conveniently located within walking distance (01 Km) of the city's oldest area. It is also just a few steps away from all the main tourist attractions.
