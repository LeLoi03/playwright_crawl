  All News   

 The FSCD  conference includes all research of the inter-related formal areas of researchers in formal structures for computation and deduction in general, and in particular all subjects that were previously covered by the RTA  and TLCA  conferences.  
 The name of the new conference comes from an unpublished but important book by Gérard Huet  that has been a strong influence on many researchers in our area. We are grateful to Gérard for allowing us to reuse the name.  
 We look very much forward to serve the scientific community with this new conference, which inherits as well as updates and modernizes the scope of the conferences it replaces. The call for papers for the next FSCD, below, give further details on the subjects of the conference.

 The proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) of Schloss Dagstuhl. All LIPIcs proceedings are open access.  
 Special Issue  
 There will be a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science of selected papers. More details will be provided later.  
 Submission guidelines  
 The submission site is:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2025   
 Submissions must be formatted using the LIPIcs style files  and submitted via EasyChair.  
 Submissions can be made in two categories. Regular research papers are limited to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices. They must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. System descriptions are limited to 15 pages, excluding references. Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal consideration. A system description must present new software tools, or significantly new versions of such tools, in which FSCD topics play an important role. An archive of the code with instructions on how to install and run the tool must be submitted. In addition, a webpage where the system can be experimented with should be provided.  
 One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the work in person at the conference. In case that this is not possible for some unforeseen reason, online presentation will be arranged, but in person registration will still be required.  
 Best paper award by junior researchers  
 The programme committee will select a paper in which at least one author is a junior researcher, i.e. either a student or whose PhD award date is less than three years from the first day of the meeting. When submitting the paper, other authors should declare to the PC Chair that at least 50% of contribution is made by the junior researcher(s).

They must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. System descriptions are limited to 15 pages, excluding references. Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal consideration. A system description must present new software tools, or significantly new versions of such tools, in which FSCD topics play an important role. An archive of the code with instructions on how to install and run the tool must be submitted. In addition, a webpage where the system can be experimented with should be provided.  
 One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the work in person at the conference. In case that this is not possible for some unforeseen reason, online presentation will be arranged, but in person registration will still be required.  
 Best paper award by junior researchers  
 The programme committee will select a paper in which at least one author is a junior researcher, i.e. either a student or whose PhD award date is less than three years from the first day of the meeting. When submitting the paper, other authors should declare to the PC Chair that at least 50% of contribution is made by the junior researcher(s).

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.

 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

  Call for Papers  
 General information  
 FSE 2025 will take place in Rome, Italy on March 17-21, 2025. FSE 2025 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research  (IACR).  
 The scope of FSE concentrates on fast and secure primitives for symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, hash functions, message authentication codes, (cryptographic) permutations, authenticated encryption schemes, cryptanalysis and evaluation tools, and security issues and solutions regarding their implementation.  
 Since 2017, FSE also solicits submissions for Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers aim at reviewing and contextualizing the existing literature in a particular area in order to systematize the existing knowledge in that area. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions.  
  
 How to submit

 Publication Model  
 From 2017, FSE has moved to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. Submitted articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in Gold Open Access (free availability from day one) by the Ruhr University of Bochum in an issue of the newly established journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology  (ToSC).  
 The yearly FSE event will consist of presentations of the articles accepted to the journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology as well as invited talks and social activities. This new model has been established as a way to improve reviewing and publication quality while retaining the highly successful community event FSE. For any further information, please view the ToSC FAQ page  .  
 For FSE 2025, authors can submit papers to the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology four times, every three months on a predictable schedule. Authors are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. In addition to accept and reject decisions, papers may be provided with "minor revision" decisions, in which case the paper is conditionally accepted and an assigned shepherd will verify if the changes are applied, or "major revision" decisions, in which case authors are invited to revise and resubmit their article to one of the following two submission deadlines, otherwise the paper will be treated as a new submission. We endeavor to assign the same reviewers to revised versions.  
 Papers accepted for publication before the end of January 2025 will be presented at that year's conference. Note that it is mandatory that accepted papers at the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology journal are presented at the corresponding FSE event.  
   
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the General Chairs.

  FSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Research Papers FSE 2025   
   
 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

Please also note that the names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Education Papers 
  Call for Education Papers  
  
 The FSE 2025 Education Track provides a venue for sharing of research and innovation in software engineering education. Submissions are expected to have a strong focus on the learning and teaching of software engineering, as a topic of courses and degree programs in higher education, as well as continuing education and on-the-job training. The work should be original, demonstrating novelty either in empirical insights or educational approach.  
 Topics of interest   
 To be relevant to the conference, a paper must be original, with the innovation or research findings focussing on software engineering education. More specifically, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative learning and teaching approaches for software engineering 
  Empirical studies of learning effectiveness and student satisfaction 
  Curriculum change and development in software engineering education 
  Identifying current and emerging competence needs for software engineering graduates 
  Assessment and evaluation in software engineering education 
  Enhancing soft skills of software engineering students 
  Sustainability and ethics in software engineering education 
  Tools and platforms for software engineering education 
  Games-based learning in software engineering education 
  Project-based and problem-based learning in software engineering education 
  Work-integrated learning in software engineering education 
  Continuing education and on the job-training for software engineers 
  Implications of AI on graduate competence needs 
  Usage of AI to support learning and assessment 
  Academic integrity in software engineering education 
  Addressing student well-being, belonging and equity 
  Paper categories   
 FSE 2025 wants to make the sharing of educational research as forthcoming as possible. For this reason, we provide two paper categories for the Education Track:  
 Short papers (5 pages, plus 1 page with references): Ideal for shorter contributions, such as lessons learnt from innovative educational approaches. 
  Long papers (10 pages, plus 2 pages with references): Ideal for thorough empirical research papers about software engineering education. 
  Both types of submissions should clearly identify their novel contribution to software engineering education research, either in terms of the novelty of the educational approach explored, or in the originality of the findings beyond already established knowledge.  
 Both paper types will be reviewed based on the same evaluation criteria, but short papers may have a smaller set of contributions and somewhat less validation than full papers. All accepted papers will appear in the main conference proceedings.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 All submissions will be evaluated based on originality, significance, soundness, thoroughness of evaluation, quality of presentation, and appropriate discussion of related work. Additional key reviewing criteria for the education track are listed below.  
 Educational focus | : The paper provides original insights either on the current status of software engineering education, and/or how it could be improved. 
  Clarity and potential utility of lessons learned | : The clarity in which the lessons learned are presented, and to what extent they may be useful to other educators or educational researchers. 
  Important Dates   
 All dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h)  
 Submission deadline - January 15, 2025 
  Author notification - March 25, 2025 
  Camera ready - April 21, 2025 
  How to Submit   
 Submissions must be in English.  
 for short papers: 5 pages for all text and figures, plus 1 page for references. 
  for long papers: 10 pages for all text and figures plus 2 pages for references. 
  Submissions can be double-blind, but do not have to be. We leave it up to the authors to judge whether they want to include their names, affiliation, and the company in which the work was performed.  
 At the time of submission, all papers must conform to the FSE 2025 Format and Submission Guidelines  .  
 Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 Education submission site: https://fse2025-seet.hotcrp.com/

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

  FSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Research Papers FSE 2025   
   
 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 General information FSE 2025 will take place in Rome, Italy on March 17-21, 2025. FSE 2025 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). The scope of FSE concentrates on fast and secure primitives for symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, hash functions, message authentication codes, (cryptographic) permutations, authenticated encryption schemes, cryptanalysis and evaluation tools, and security issues and solutions regarding their implementation. Since 2017, FSE also solicits submissions for Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers aim at reviewing and contextualizing the existing literature in a particular area in order to systematize the existing knowledge in that area. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions. Stipends Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the General Chairs. Publication Model From 2017, FSE has moved to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. Submitted articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in Gold Open Access (free availability from day one) by the Ruhr University of Bochum in an issue of the newly established journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC). The yearly FSE event will consist of presentations of the articles accepted to the journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology, as well as invited talks and social activities. This new model has been established as a way to improve reviewing and publication quality while retaining the highly successful community event FSE. For any further information, please view the ToSC FAQ page. For FSE 2025, authors can submit papers to the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology four times, every three months on a predictable schedule. Authors are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. In addition to accept and reject decisions, papers may be provided with "minor revision" decisions, in which case the paper is conditionally accepted and an assigned shepherd will verify if the changes are applied, or "major revision" decisions, in which case authors are invited to revise and resubmit their article to one of the following two submission deadlines, otherwise the paper will be treated as a new submission. We endeavor to assign the same reviewers to revised versions. Papers accepted for publication before the end of January 2025 will be presented at that year's conference. Note that it is mandatory that accepted papers at the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology journal are presented at the corresponding FSE event.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-09-16

  FSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Research Papers FSE 2025   
   
 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

  The official publication date is the date the journal issue is made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be as early as July 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. Please also note that the names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ 
  Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research.  
 Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  
 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks please see the general formatting instructions  .   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

16. Conference FTfJP_0:
Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs (FTfJP)  
 Goals  
 The Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs (FTfJP) workshop aims to bring together people working on formal techniques and tool support for Java, or closely related languages such as C# or Scala, either with the aim to describe, analyse, and verify aspects and properties of these programming languages themselves (type systems, semantics bytecode verification, etc.), or of programs written in these languages.  
  Java-like languages provide a good platform to bridge the gap between formal techniques and practical program development, because of the reasonably clear semantics and standardised libraries.  
   
 In 2002 the name of the workshop was changed slightly - from "Formal Techniques for Java Programs" to "Formal Techniques for Java- like  Programs" - to include not just work on Java, but also work on related languages such as C# or Scala.  
   
 Steering Committee  
 The steering committee of FTfJP consists of:  
   
 Werner Dietl 
  Radu Grigore 
  Gary T. Leavens 
  Rosemary Monahan  (chair) 
  Alex Summers 
    
 Previous members:  
   
 Peter Müller

 Submission Guidelines  
   
 Submissions must be in electronic form via EasyChair  using the LIPIcs LaTeX style file available here  . Submissions must not exceed 15 pages (excluding bibliography), but may include a clearly marked appendix containing technical details. The appendix will be read only at the discretion of the program committee. Simultaneous submissions to journals or other conferences with published proceedings are disallowed.  
 Reviewing for FSTTCS 2024 is double-blind  . Hence, authors must make a reasonable effort to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Specifically, kindly replace your name and affiliation on the first page with the submission number and do not include any acknowledgements in your submission. Also, authors should cite their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed”, please write “XYZ et al. showed”). Submitting a paper that is available at a public preprint server (such as, arXiv) is admissible. In that case, please do not cite that version of your work in the submission itself.  
 Accepted papers will be published as proceedings of the conference in the ​Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)  ​ as a free, open, electronic archive with access to all. Authors will retain full rights over their work. The accepted papers will be published under a ​CC-BY license​  . For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, one of the authors must commit to presenting the paper in person at the conference.  
 Authors must submit abstracts by July 5 and full papers by July 12.

  Call for Papers - FTfJP 2022 
  Participation: Participation in the workshop is hybrid as with ECOOP 2022, but registration through the ECOOP registration system is required. As a hybrid event, when considering virtual mode, the registration system will provide you with the link to participate in the Zoom conference sessions.  
 Formal techniques can help analyse programs, precisely describe program behaviour, and verify program properties. Modern programming languages are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new programming languages (PL) research challenges.  
 Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other. FTfJP is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields.  
 The workshop has a broad PL theme; the most important criterion is that submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community. The term “Java-like” is somewhat historic and should be interpreted broadly: FTfJP solicits and welcomes submission relating to programming languages in general, beyond Java, including C#, Scala, etc.  
 Example topics of interest include (but not limited to):  
 Language design and semantics 
  Type systems 
  Concurrency and new application domains 
  Specification and verification of program properties 
  Program analysis (static or dynamic) 
  Program synthesis 
  Security Pearls (programs or proofs) 
  Programming environments 
  FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, tools, and position papers. Webpages for previous workshops in this series are available at: https://ftfjp.github.io/  .  
 We plan that, as in previous years, accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Papers - FTfJP 2022  
  
 Submissions   
 Contributions are sought in two categories:  
 Full Papers (6 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, tool, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions. 
  Short Papers (2 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD. 
  All submissions and reviews will be managed within EasyChair. Submissions should be made via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2022  . There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).  
 Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, there is no need to anonymize submissions.  
 The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.  
 Formatting and Publication   
 All authors should use the official “ACM Master article template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template pages ( https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ). Latex users should use the “sigconf” option as well as “review” (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers). To that end, the following latex code can be placed at the start of the latex document: \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}  
 We plan that, as in previous years, accepted papers will be published in a venue such as the ACM Digital Library, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.  
 Selected papers will also be considered for extended versions to be submitted to the Journal of Object Technology (JOT).  

 Place  
   
 All presentations are scheduled to be held either in person or remotely. Feel free to join in via zoom if you cannot make it to Berlin.  
 Place: Room Stockholm 2 at the Hotel Scandic [in person participation]

 Call for Papers  
  
 ECOOP  is a conference about programming originally focused on object-orientation, but now including all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions.  
  
  Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:  
 Research. | The most traditional category for papers that advance the state of the art. 
  Reproduction. | An empirical evaluation that reconstructs a published experiment in a different context in order to validate the results of that earlier work. 
  Experience. | Applications of known PL techniques in practice as well as tools. Industry papers will be reviewed by practitioners. We welcome negative results that may provide inspiration for future research. 
  Pearls/Brave New Ideas. | Articles that either explain a known idea in an elegant way or unconventional papers introducing ideas that may take some time to substantiate. These papers may be short. 
   Submissions   
 Submission must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work. In case of doubt, contact the chair. Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style  template. To reduce friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will be reformatted).  
 ECOOP uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DB FAQ. /if in doubt, contact the chairs.  
 There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue.  
 Authors will be given a three-day period to read and respond to the reviews of their papers before the program committee meeting. Responses have no length limit.  
 ECOOP 2022 will have two deadlines for submissions, three months apart. Future years may have more deadlines. Papers submitted in each round can be (a) accepted, (b) rejected, or (c) asked for revisions. Revisions can be submitted at a later round. Papers retain their reviewers during revision.  
  Artifact Evaluation and Intent   
 To support replication of experiments, authors of research papers may submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. They will be asked whether they intend to submit an artifact at submission time. It is understood that some paper do not have artifacts. AEC members will serve on the extended review committee.  
  Journal First and Journal After   
 We have Journal First / After arrangements with ACM’s Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Elsevier’s Science of Computer Programming (SCP) and AITO’s Journal of Object Technology (JOT).  
 Only new research papers are eligible to be Journal First (JF). JF papers will have an extended abstract in the ECOOP proceedings. The deadline is that same as round 1 of submissions and the notification is aligned with round 2 notification. TOPLAS JF papers should be submitted according to this announcement. SCP JF papers should follow this call for papers. JF papers are presented at the conference and eligible for awards.  
 Journal After (JA) papers are papers for which the authors request to be considered for post conference journal publication. Once accepted by the ECOOP PC, these papers will be forwarded to the journal editors. Reviews and reviewers will be forwarded and used at the editor’s discretion. JA papers will have an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) in the conference proceedings.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 FAQ  
   
 Frequently Asked Questions   

 Multiple deadlines   
 Q: What are use-cases of the new submission process?    
 Overall, multiple deadlines are meant to speed up the reviewing cycle and better support revisions. Our expectation is that more  papers will be accepted with this new process.  
 A paper is submitted in R1. Reviewers find it good as is, the paper is accepted. A preprint is added to the conference website as soon as the camera ready copy is complete. The paper is presented at ECOOP’22. 
  A paper is submitted in R1. The reviewers requires changes. Authors have one month to revise and resubmit for R2. The same reviewers check the paper, and accept it. Authors have one more month to finalise their work. The paper is presented at ECOOP’22. 
  A paper is submitted in R2. The reviewers require changes. The paper will not be presented at ECOOP’22. Authors can resubmit at the next deadline (TBA). The same reviewers check the paper, if accepted, a pre-print is put on the ECOOP’23 website and the paper is presented in 2023. 
  Artifacts   
 Q: Are artifacts required?    
 No! But if an artifact is not provided, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  
 Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?    
 Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  
 Q: Can an artifact help clear up confusion about a paper’s result?    
 Yes! That is the whole point of allowing artifacts to be submitted together with the paper.  
 Q: Who reviews artifacts?    
 The Artifact Evaluation Committee as usual.  
 Authors: Double-Blinding Submissions   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?    
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity.  
 Q: Should I change the name of my system?    
 No.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?    
 Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the chair.  
 Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work?    
 No. But we recommend to change the title to distinguish the papers.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media?    
 There is a tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs. Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, workshops, job interviews, etc. 
  Post on arXiv or a similar site. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact us.  
 Reviewers: Double-blind   
 Q: What should I do if I if I learn the authors’ identity?    
 If at any point you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, you should contact the Program Chair. Otherwise you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from regular blind reviewing. In particular, you should refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: The authors provided a URL to supplemental material, what should I do?    
 Contact the Chair, who will download the material on your behalf.  
 Q: Can I seek an outside review?    
 No.

 About 
  Program 
  20th Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs   
 Formal techniques can help analyze programs, precisely describe program behavior, and verify program properties. Languages such as Java, C#, and Scala are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new PL research challenges.  
 Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other. FTfJP is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields. The workshop has a broad PL theme; the most important criterion is that submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community. Example topics of interest include:  
 Language design and semantics 
  Type systems 
  Concurrency and new application domains 
  Specification and verification of program properties 
  Program analysis (static or dynamic) 
  Security 
  Pearls (programs or proofs) 
  FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers. Just as the number and the feature set of Java-like languages is expanding, the term “Java-like” should be interpreted broadly.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Contributions related to formal techniques for Java-like programs are sought in two categories:  
 Full Papers.  In 6 two-column pages, the paper should present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions.  
 Short Papers.  In 2 two-column pages, the paper should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.  
 Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and based on their potential to generate interesting discussions. The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.  
 Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library by default, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. The use of ACM’s template for the SIGPLAN format  is required. At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.

 Fun with Algorithms  
 Algorithms and data structures are the base of all computing, from CRUD APIs to highly optimized data processing.  
 Software Design   
 Fun   
   
 Most of us probably have forgotten more than we remember about them though from college (or maybe never learned them in the first place) because we don't necessarily use them on a daily. But just like math, good knowledge about data structures and algorithms lay the foundation for how to think about difficult problems, and how to understand where and what to optimize.  
 This session is a programming language agnostic journey through problem solving - graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, representations and data structures. How to build solutions from first principles and combine algos to build up from easy to medium to hard leet code or advent of code style problems.  
 I'll also share how algorithm puzzles and competitive programming brought the fun back into programming for me, and how I use these skills in my day job.

 Call for Papers  
  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions is expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience. Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of software testing and analysis methods or tools.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artifact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 In particular, replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently. This means that it is also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artifacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artifacts the study is built on, and to submit those artifacts to the artifact evaluation  . Artifacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Two Submission Deadlines and Major Revisions   
 ISSTA 2024 features two submission deadlines. The instructions in this call apply to both deadlines. You can choose to submit at either deadline. Only papers submitted to the first deadline may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the second deadline. Papers submitted to the second deadline will be either accepted or rejected, i.e., there is no option for a major revision.  
 Papers that are rejected during the first round may not be resubmitted to the second round  . Authors who try to bypass this rule (e.g., by changing the paper title without significantly changing paper content, or by making small changes to the paper content) will have their papers desk-rejected without further consideration. Papers rejected from the first or second submission round can, of course, be submitted to ISSTA 2025 without any restrictions.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors are acknowledging that that all co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of the paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Research Papers, Experience Papers, and Replicability Studies should be at most 10 pages in length, with at most 2 additional pages for references only. The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 10 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission, e.g., “XXX (Experience Paper)”. All authors should use the official “ACM Master article template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template  pages. Latex users should use the “sigconf” option, as well as the “review” (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and “anonymous” (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following Latex code can be placed at the start of the Latex document:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,review, anonymous]{acmart} \acmConference[ISSTA 2024]{ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis}{16-20 September, 2024}{Vienna, Austria}   Submit your papers via the HotCRP ISSTA 2024 submission website  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews during a rebuttal period. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chair may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The authors will have a chance to read the additional reviews and respond to them during the additional short response period. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2024 will conduct double-blind reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors have the right to upload preprints on arXiv or similar sites, but they must avoid specifying that the paper was submitted to ISSTA.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles, and encourage all contributing authors to disclose data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee, or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Data must be shared in an anonymized way (e.g., no information on authors/affiliations in the code) via a site that reveals neither the authors’ nor the reviewers’ identities (e.g., not via Google Drive). At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.  
 Publication Date   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Body   
 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will host the 28th ISIF Fusion Conference  from July 7-11, 2025, the first ever in South America. Rio de Janeiro never fails to impress with its modern outlook that reflects its progression through the times of yore. The historic sites, sparkling beaches, green belts and cheerful attitude of the locals attract tourists where heaven meets earth. If Ronaldo played football at the Maracanã stadium, then Christ the Redeemer put Rio on the world map. Rio's carnival, with its energetic samba dancers jiggling their hips, attracts thousands of tourists from around the world. The rain-forests, museums, beaches, gardens and the glitz of the city have made Rio what it is today Brazil's top-notch tourist destination.

 7th – 11th July 2024  

 JOIN US AT THE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION FUSION IN VENICE, ITALY  

 With the proliferation of sensor technology and ever-increasing amounts of data generated, Information Fusion  is critical for combining noisy and possibly conflicting observations from various sensors and actors into actionable, coherent information about the underlying situation. The 27  th   International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)  is providing a scientific forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government agencies to discuss the latest advancements on classical model-based and emerging data-driven autonomous methodologies on sensor  , data  , information  and knowledge fusion  , new system frameworks  , hybrid processing techniques, and the associated challenges at the systemic level  , including system design paradigms and issues of system control, management, test, and evaluation.   
  
 Venice, Italy,  will be home to FUSION 2024  . Venice was founded over 1,500 years ago on 117 different islands in the middle of the Venetian Lagoon in Northern Italy. This pioneering city was built on water, and water is totally incorporated into the daily life of its inhabitants.  
 Venice was one of the most powerful European States for several centuries, giving birth to a unique culture and lifestyle. The waters of the lagoon rise and flood the city on a regular basis, complicating efforts to preserve its architecture, which includes Italian, Arabic, Byzantine, and Renaissance forms.  
 Today Venice is recognized as part of the artistic and architectural heritage of all humanity. Venice and its lagoon were collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It is renowned nationally and internationally for its charm and its enchanting landscapes. The visitor arriving in Venice is transported into another world, one of incomparable atmosphere and beauty.  
 Churches, museums, and art galleries are present in every corner of the city. Venice is a tourist city par excellence, and over the years has perfected its ability to welcome its visitors.  
 We look forward to welcoming you to Italy.

 Contest 2025: Live Challenge  
  
 ← GD'25  Call for participation  Creative Topic  Live Challenge    
   
 Minimizing the \(k\) in \(k\)-Plane Drawings  
 (This is a preliminary version of the 2025 challenge and rules, more details to follow soon.)  
 We shall hold the Graph Drawing Challenge in a format similar to a typical programming contest. At the start of the challenge, teams of contestants will receive the collection of challenge graphs. After one hour, the teams will submit their final drawings and the team with the highest cumulative score wins.  
 Teams will be allowed to use any combination of software and human interaction systems to produce the best drawings. To accommodate both teams wishing to prepare for the challenge and teams wishing simply to participate, with no preparation, we will be providing, in advance, a small set of graph visualization tools. These tools are not necessarily meant to solve the problems at hand but are there to help the teams manually draw and manipulate the graphs. To further the development of new tools and to help promote tools already in existence, teams are also welcome and highly encouraged to create and bring their own software packages.  
 There will be two categories in the challenge that are judged independently:  
 Automatic  : This category is for teams using their own tool. Since we assume that the tool contains special algorithms to solve the challenge automatically, these teams will receive larger challenge graphs. Manual fine-tuning is allowed. 
  Manual  : This category is for teams using the provided graph editor. The graph editor does not contain any specific algorithm to solve the challenge. It allows only to change vertex locations. This category is for creating manual solutions without help of an automatic algorithm. Teams in this category will receive smaller challenge graphs. The tool is available in the submission system  . 
  The challenge focuses of finding drawings of graphs that have as few crossings as possible per edge. In other words, the aim is to find a \(k\)-plane drawing of the graph with \(k\) being as low as possible, where a \(k\)-plane drawing is one where each edge has at most \(k\) crossings.  
 Here is an overview of the rules for the challenge:  
 The challenge will take place for one hour during the Graph Drawing Symposium. 
  Teams may consist of up to three participants each. Each team should bring their own computers and/or software tools to the challenge. 
  Each team is required to have a representative on sight during the challenge | (Details on how this rule is going to be implemented will follow. It will be possible to name a representative in some shape or form who does not need to be a team member.) 
  Software tools for manually solving the challenge will be provided for each team with time available prior to the challenge to set-up and practice with the system. 
  At the start of the challenge, contestants will receive a collection of graphs in the format described below. 
  For each graph, the team submitting the \(k\)-plane drawing with the smallest \(k\) receives the highest score. Scores for other submissions of the same graph shall be weighed with respect to this value. 
  The team with the highest total score over all graphs wins. 
  \(k\)-Plane Drawings  
 We consider only straight-line \(k\)-plane drawings in this challenge. We require that no two vertices are placed on the same coordinate and that no vertex is contained in the interior of a segment forming an edge. A drawing is said to be \(k\)-plane if there are at most \(k\) crossings per edge. To count crossings we take the maximum number of crossings over all edges. Crossings will always be counted pairwise, i.e., if three edges or more cross in the same point each pair of edges is counted as one crossing.  
 All drawings have to use integer coordinates in the range \(0\) to a provided maximum value (see below for how this is specified). To avoid the grid-size being the limited factor we will always set the size of the grid to at least \(n^2\) where \(n\) is the number of vertices of the provided graph. Below two drawings of the same graph as examples. The graph is \(K_7\) minus one edge, we see that, unsurprisingly, a drawing with all vertices placed on the boundary of a disk is not always optimal.  
  Figure 1: A 4-plane drawing.    Figure 2: A 2-plane drawing of the same graph.     
 File Format  
 For the GD Contest 2023, a JSON  format described below will be used. The contest graphs will be provided in this format and the final submissions should be prepared using the same format. A valid JSON file consists of the following entries:  
 nodes | : An array with one element per node of the graph. Each element has the following entries: | id | : The id of the node. Has to be an integer between 0 and #nodes-1. 
  x | : The x-coordinate of the node. Has to be an integer between 0 and width. 
  y | : The y-coordinate of the node. Has to be an integer between 0 and height. 
  edges | : An array with one element per edge of the graph. Each element has the following entries: | source | : The | id | of the source node. 
  target | : The | id | of the target node. 
  width | (optional): The maximum x-coordinate of the grid. Has to be a non-negative integer. If unspecified, the width is set to 1,000,000. 
  height | (optional): The maximum y-coordinate of the grid. Has to be a non-negative integer. If unspecified, the height is set to 1,000,000. 
  Sample File  
 Below is a simple example:  
 { "nodes": [ { "id": 0, "x": 1, "y": 0 }, { "id": 1, "x": 0, "y": 2 }, { "id": 2, "x": 2, "y": 2 }, { "id": 3, "x": 1, "y": 4 }], "edges": [ { "source": 0, "target": 1 }, { "source": 0, "target": 2 }, { "source": 1, "target": 2 }, { "source": 1, "target": 3 }, { "source": 2, "target": 3 }], "width": 6, "height": 6 }     
   
 How to participate  
 The Live Challenge will be part of the 33rd International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization, the precise date and location are going to be announced soon.  
 If you wish to participate in the manual category, you will attempt to solve the problems using the supplied tool.  
 If you wish to participate in the automatic category, you can use any software you wish to solve the problems, including the supplied tool. However, problems instances will be much larger than in the manual category.  
 You may use at most one computer per team.   
 The challenge will be run through an online submission system. We are currently updating the system for the 2025 challenge, but you can play with the previous version for 2024 here  . The problem currently loaded in the tool is unrelated to the one of 2025.

 About Graph Drawing 2025  
 Graph Drawing is concerned with the geometric representation of graphs and constitutes the algorithmic core of Network Visualization. Graph Drawing and Network Visualization are motivated by applications where it is crucial to visually analyze and interact with relational datasets. Examples of such application areas include data science, social sciences, Web computing, information systems, biology, geography, business intelligence, information security and software engineering.  
 The symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization has been the main annual event in this area for more than 30 years. Its focus is on combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of graph drawing as well as the design of network visualization systems and interfaces.

  GECCO 2025 @ Málaga (hybrid)  
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference  
 July 14 - 18, 2025  

 Why GECCO?  
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation since 1999. Topics include: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, learning for evolutionary computation, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real world applications, search-based software engineering, theory, benchmarking, reproducibility, hybrids and more.  
  This is GECCO   Call for Sponsors    

  Málaga  
 Málaga is a thriving and dynamic city in Southern Spain. Bathed by the Mediterranean Sea and surrounded by Málaga Mountains, the city enjoys a warm climate tempered by the proximity of the sea. This has contributed to make Málaga one of the main touristic destinations in Europe. The city has however much more to offer than sun and beaches.  
 Indeed, Málaga is a city of Art & Culture: having been founded by the Phoenicians in 7th century BC and subsequently ruled by Romans, Moors, and Castilian Kings, the city comprises numerous monuments (the Roman Theater, the Moorish Fortress and Castle, the Cathedral, etc.), churches, palaces, and noteworthy buildings that illustrate this historical past.  
 Málaga was also the home town of Pablo Ruiz Picasso, and not surprisingly it is also known as the City of Museums with +30 museums devoted to Painting, Sculpture, Music, Jewellery, Sports, just to name a few.  
 All of the above can be complemented by letting oneself be embedded in Malagueño life style, enjoying the local gastronomy, the warm weather, and the hospitality of the people. And if you need more, Málaga is an excellent base for exploring nearby places, thanks to its exceptional transport infrastructure.

 General Information    
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025) will present the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real-world applications, theory, hybrids and more. The full list of tracks   is available.  
 The GECCO 2025 Program Committee invites the submission of technical papers describing your best work in genetic and evolutionary computation. Full papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references) should present original work that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Main Proceedings  of GECCO. For full papers, a separate abstract needs to be submitted first by January 22, 2025  . Full papers are due by the non-extensible  deadline of January 29, 2025  .  
 Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously evaluated in a double-blind review process. Evaluation is done on a per-track basis, ensuring high interest and high expertise of the reviewers. Review criteria include the significance of the work, technical soundness, novelty, clarity, writing quality, relevance and, if applicable, sufficiency of information to permit replication.  
 Besides full papers, poster-only papers of at most 4 pages (including references) may be submitted. Poster-only papers should present original work that has not yet reached the maturity and completeness of research results that are published as full papers at GECCO. The review of poster-only papers follows the same double-blind process mentioned above. Accepted poster-only papers will appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Companion Proceedings  of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 29, 2025  , and no abstract needs to be submitted first.  
 By submitting a paper, the author(s) agree that, if their paper is accepted, they will:  
 Submit a final, revised, camera-ready version to the publisher on or before the camera-ready deadline 
  Register at least one author before | May 8, 2025 | to attend the conference 
  Attend the conference (at least one author) 
  Present the accepted paper at the conference 
  Each paper accepted needs to have at least one author registered. If an author is presenting more than one paper at the conference, she/he does not pay any additional registration fees.

 Alternatively, you can follow this link to go directly to the paper submission website    . You must use the submission website to submit all kinds of contributions to GECCO (including the abstract of full papers).  
 Paper Categories    
 Full papers   
  Papers in this category concern the traditional full papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references)  , that are aimed to present original new work in genetic and evolutionary computation that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the main proceedings of GECCO.  
 Mandatory abstract submissions of at most 200 words for full papers are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 22 2025  ; submissions of the full papers themselves are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 29, 2025  .   
 Poster-only papers   
  Submissions are allowed that are targeted at being a poster-only paper of at most 4 pages (including references)  . Such papers should still present work in genetic and evolutionary computation that is original and new, but has not yet reached the stage of the more mature, complete research results that are typically published in full papers at GECCO. Accepted poster-only papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the companion proceedings of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by the non-extensible  deadline of January 29, 2025   . All conditions for the submission of full papers also apply to poster-only papers.  
 Double-Blind Review Process    
 Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously reviewed in a double-blind review process. In other words, authors should not know who the reviewers of their work are and reviewers should not know who the authors are. To this end, the following information is very important:  
 Submitted papers should be ANONYMIZED. This means that they should NOT contain any element that may reveal the identity of their authors. This includes author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments. Moreover, any references to any of the author's own work should be made as if the work belonged to someone else.    

  If you are using LaTeX, consider using the following header to remove author listing and to remove sections marked as containing identifying information (e.g. Acknowledgements):  
  \documentclass[dvipsnames,format=sigconf,anonymous=true,review=true]{acmart}   
 Publication Policy    
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Simultaneously submitting work to another conference or journal that is substantially similar to work also submitted to GECCO, is NOT ALLOWED  . Material may later be revised and submitted to a journal, if this is permitted by the journal.  
 It is also NOT ALLOWED  to submit work to GECCO that is substantially similar to work already accepted or published in other conferences or journals. GECCO is however still interested in such related publications. For this reason, researchers are invited to submit abstracts of their work recently published in top-tier conferences and journals to the Hot Off the Press track. Contributions will be selected to be presented at GECCO based on quality and interest to the GECCO community.  
 A notable exception to the above is the simultaneous submission of work to arXiv. Reviewers will be asked not to actively look for such submissions, but if they are aware of them, this will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date will be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 The submitted contributions will be checked using anti-plagiarism systems. Those papers or posters with a high percentage of plagiarism, exceeding the page limit, simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal, or falling out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without review.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies    , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects    .  
 Supplementary Material    
 It is possible to submit supplementary material (e.g., videos, a PDF appendix, source code, data, mathematical proofs) in addition to the PDF of the paper. In particular, we encourage authors to submit source code to support replication of experiments as described in their paper. At the time of submission, all the supplementary material must also be anonymized.  
 You can upload supplementary material as a PDF, ZIP archive (.zip) or a compressed tarball (.tgz or .tar.gz). Please use informative filenames and do not upload more than 10MB.

 General Information    
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025) will present the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real-world applications, theory, hybrids and more. The full list of tracks   is available.  
 The GECCO 2025 Program Committee invites the submission of technical papers describing your best work in genetic and evolutionary computation. Full papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references) should present original work that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Main Proceedings  of GECCO. For full papers, a separate abstract needs to be submitted first by January 22, 2025  . Full papers are due by the non-extensible  deadline of January 29, 2025  .  
 Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously evaluated in a double-blind review process. Evaluation is done on a per-track basis, ensuring high interest and high expertise of the reviewers. Review criteria include the significance of the work, technical soundness, novelty, clarity, writing quality, relevance and, if applicable, sufficiency of information to permit replication.  
 Besides full papers, poster-only papers of at most 4 pages (including references) may be submitted. Poster-only papers should present original work that has not yet reached the maturity and completeness of research results that are published as full papers at GECCO. The review of poster-only papers follows the same double-blind process mentioned above. Accepted poster-only papers will appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Companion Proceedings  of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 29, 2025  , and no abstract needs to be submitted first.  
 By submitting a paper, the author(s) agree that, if their paper is accepted, they will:  
 Submit a final, revised, camera-ready version to the publisher on or before the camera-ready deadline 
  Register at least one author before | May 8, 2025 | to attend the conference 
  Attend the conference (at least one author) 
  Present the accepted paper at the conference 
  Each paper accepted needs to have at least one author registered. If an author is presenting more than one paper at the conference, she/he does not pay any additional registration fees.

  More detailed information on the review process and the publication policy can be found below. Further instructions for paper formatting and submitting papers can be found on the Paper Submission Instructions   page.  
 Alternatively, you can follow this link to go directly to the paper submission website    . You must use the submission website to submit all kinds of contributions to GECCO (including the abstract of full papers).  
 Paper Categories    
 Full papers   
  Papers in this category concern the traditional full papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references)  , that are aimed to present original new work in genetic and evolutionary computation that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the main proceedings of GECCO.  
 Mandatory abstract submissions of at most 200 words for full papers are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 22 2025  ; submissions of the full papers themselves are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 29, 2025  .   
 Poster-only papers   
  Submissions are allowed that are targeted at being a poster-only paper of at most 4 pages (including references)  . Such papers should still present work in genetic and evolutionary computation that is original and new, but has not yet reached the stage of the more mature, complete research results that are typically published in full papers at GECCO. Accepted poster-only papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the companion proceedings of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by the non-extensible  deadline of January 29, 2025   . All conditions for the submission of full papers also apply to poster-only papers.  
 Double-Blind Review Process    
 Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously reviewed in a double-blind review process. In other words, authors should not know who the reviewers of their work are and reviewers should not know who the authors are. To this end, the following information is very important:  
 Submitted papers should be ANONYMIZED. This means that they should NOT contain any element that may reveal the identity of their authors. This includes author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments. Moreover, any references to any of the author's own work should be made as if the work belonged to someone else.    

  If you are using LaTeX, consider using the following header to remove author listing and to remove sections marked as containing identifying information (e.g. Acknowledgements):  
  \documentclass[dvipsnames,format=sigconf,anonymous=true,review=true]{acmart}   
 Publication Policy    
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Simultaneously submitting work to another conference or journal that is substantially similar to work also submitted to GECCO, is NOT ALLOWED  . Material may later be revised and submitted to a journal, if this is permitted by the journal.  
 It is also NOT ALLOWED  to submit work to GECCO that is substantially similar to work already accepted or published in other conferences or journals. GECCO is however still interested in such related publications. For this reason, researchers are invited to submit abstracts of their work recently published in top-tier conferences and journals to the Hot Off the Press track. Contributions will be selected to be presented at GECCO based on quality and interest to the GECCO community.  
 A notable exception to the above is the simultaneous submission of work to arXiv. Reviewers will be asked not to actively look for such submissions, but if they are aware of them, this will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date will be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 The submitted contributions will be checked using anti-plagiarism systems. Those papers or posters with a high percentage of plagiarism, exceeding the page limit, simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal, or falling out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without review.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies    , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects    .  
 Supplementary Material    
 It is possible to submit supplementary material (e.g., videos, a PDF appendix, source code, data, mathematical proofs) in addition to the PDF of the paper. In particular, we encourage authors to submit source code to support replication of experiments as described in their paper. At the time of submission, all the supplementary material must also be anonymized.  
 You can upload supplementary material as a PDF, ZIP archive (.zip) or a compressed tarball (.tgz or .tar.gz). Please use informative filenames and do not upload more than 10MB. Consider making the code available in a publicly accessible repository with a declared plan to enable permanent accessibility (e.g. zenodo).  
 The supplementary material may or may not be considered when evaluating the paper, at the discretion of the reviewers.

 The IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium is the flagship event established and organized by the Internet Technical Committee (ITC), a joint committee of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) and the Internet Society (ISOC). The GI Symposium provides a top forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advances in the current and future Internet and Internet-related technologies. The focus of the GI symposium is on experimental systems over the Internet and the design of future global Internet technologies, such as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing, Artificial-Intelligence-based intelligent Internet, industrial Internet, and vehicular and drone networks, especially on a global Internet scale. The GI symposium also has a special focus on measurements-related aspects, besides the emerging technologies. In addition to the traditional research papers, we encourage papers with well-thought-through concepts and positions, papers that contrast proposed approaches, papers that clarify and compare inherent differences between competing technologies, and heresies.  
 The topics of interest for the GI 2024 include but are not limited to the following:  
 Routing, switching and addressing 
  Future Internet and next-generation network architectures 
  Information-centric networking, Software-defined networking, and network function virtualization 
  Wireless Internet and Internet technologies for 5G/6G 
  Datacenter network architectures and performance 
  Integration of in-network computation, cloud, and edge/fog computing 
  Next generation Internet applications in the cloud continuum 
  Machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics for intelligent Internet 
  Space-air-ground integrated network 
  Quantum Internet and quantum networking 
  Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine, sensor, and vehicular/drone networks 
  Industrial Internet and time-sensitive and deterministic networks 
  Integrating blockchain with distributed Internet edges 
  Energy-efficient green communications 
  Geo-distributed applications, consistency, and latency challenges 
  Content delivery and management 
  Internet exchanges, remote peering, and peer-to-peer networks 
  Internet structure and analysis 
  Network-aware applications 
  Real-world Measurements and deployments 
  Distributed systems and novel distributed Internet applications 
  Online social networking 
  Internet measurement, modeling, and visualization 
  Large-scale network operations, management, and performance monitoring

 GI 2025  will be held in Kelowna, British Columbia, from May 26 to May 29, 2025. We seek submissions covering all aspects of graphics, HCI, and visualization. All paper submissions are rigorously peer-reviewed by at least three members of the international program committee. Visit the conference site for details.     
   
 AWARDS  Each year, the CHCCS recognizes outstanding Canadian researchers and students who have made significant advances and contributions to the fields of computer graphics and human-computer interaction (HCI).     
   
 ARCHIVES  Graphics Interface (GI) is the longest running conference in the field. Browse our extensive conference proceedings archive (1971 – Present) for information about past conferences.     
   
 AI/GI/CRV  While Graphics Interface was held in conjunction with the Computer and Robot Vision (CRV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences for many years, in 2020 it will be held independently with the objective of reducing costs for participants, and in particular increasing student participation.

  About Graphics Interface 

 About Graphics Interface  
 Computer graphics, visualization and human-computer interaction (HCI)  

 Graphics Interface (GI)  is an annual international conference devoted to computer graphics and human-computer interaction (HCI). With a graphics track and an HCI track having equal weights in the conference, GI offers a unique venue for a meeting of minds working on computer graphics and interactive techniques. GI is the longest running conference in the field (the first conference was held in 1969), consistently attracting high-quality submissions from graphics, HCI, as well as visualization.  
 The conference prides itself on high quality reviewing with all paper submissions being fully peer reviewed by at least two members of the program committee and two external reviewers. Since 2004, accepted papers have been archived in the ACM Digital Library,  while earlier years are available in the Graphics Interface Archive  .  
 The Michael A. J. Sweeney Award  is awarded at the conference to the best student papers in graphics and HCI. This award comes with a CHCCS sponsored $200 cash prize, and, in some years, an industry sponsored prize. Authors of selected top papers have been invited to submit extended and revised manuscripts to be considered, with partial reviewer continuity, for journal publication in IEEE TVCG  (since 2015) and in a special section of  Computers and Graphics   (since 2012). Theses journal publication agreements are renewed annually.  
 GI features two invited keynote speakers  , one from the area of graphics and the other from human-computer interaction. The conference includes a posters and demos session  featuring late breaking research and work in progress with high potential. Best posters are selected for both the HCI and graphics tracks. Each set of winning poster co-authors receive a CHCCS sponsored $50 cash prize, or in some years an industry sponsored prize.  
 An additional keynote talk is given by the winner(s) of the CHCCS Achievement Award  , and invited talks are given by winners of the Alain Fournier  and Bill Buxton Ph.D. Dissertation  awards. GI is held in conjunction with Computer and Robot Vision (CRV)  and Artificial Intelligence (AI)  . A single registration provides access to all keynotes, invited and paper talks, as well as the common poster and demo session of the three conferences.  
 Sponsors  
  Graphics Interface  is sponsored by the Canadian Human-Computer Communications Society (CHCCS/SCDHM)  . Vision Interface  is sponsored by the Canadian Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Society  (CIPPRS) and the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Conference  is sponsored by the Canadian Society for the Computational Studies of Intelligence  (CAIAC).  
 Getting Involved  
 All Graphics Interface attendees are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting, or to contact any member of the Executive Committee  about CHCCS/SCDHM  . We encourage anyone interested in the future of Graphics Interface to attend and get involved.  
 If you wish to receive announcements about the Graphics Interface conference or other CHCCS/SCDHM activities you can subscribe to the Mailing List  .
