  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 Deadlines   
 Early Registration Deadline | December 9, 2024 
  Reserve Now: Hotel Reservation Deadline Extended! | December 13, 2024 
  Deadline Passed: Submissions | July 5, 2024 

 Important Submission Information  
 Submissions are due by 11:59 p.m. on July 5, 2024, anywhere on earth. Submissions received after this time will not be considered. All submissions must be in PDF format and submitted electronically.  
 There is a single submission deadline for both registering and submitting a paper; there is not a separate abstract deadline.   
 Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair and vice chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and the discussion remain confidential from the authors. PC submissions are not eligible for the best paper award.  
 Anonymous Submissions   
 The conference will employ a fairly lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”).  
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 We note that a similar policy has recently been incorporated in several other major venues in TCS.  
 Rebuttal Phase  
 Authors will have an opportunity to respond to initial reviews during a rebuttal phase. The initial reviews will be released to authors by September 6, and author-responses are due on September 10. Further instructions will be sent to the authors at that time.  

 General Information  
  
 Acceptance Notification | The Program Committee will distribute acceptance notices and final paper submission instructions to authors of accepted papers by early October 2024. These instructions must be followed to ensure inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 SIAM will distribute a follow-up notice and post a list of accepted papers in October 2024. 
  Speaker Cancellation | The Organizing Committee expects every speaker in a scheduled presentation to register and attend.  
 If it becomes necessary for a speaker to cancel a presentation, he or she should try to find an alternate presenter immediately, preferably a co-author. See SIAM Policy on Substitute Speakers and Remote Presentations  . Contact SIAM at [email protected]   immediately with any change to a scheduled presentation.  
 A “no-show” or cancelled presentation can cause serious inconvenience to the attendees and organizers. The committee thanks all speakers in advance for their compliance to this request. 
  Proceedings | The proceedings will be posted online in early January 2025. 

 Submission Instructions  
 Submission Link  
 Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF format (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  
 The submission server is available at https://soda25.hotcrp.com  .   
 For questions related to SODA submissions, contact the PC Chairs Yossi Azar and Debmalya Panigrahi at [email protected]   .  
 Paper Selection  
 Selection of papers will be based on the extent to which the results and the presentation yield new insights for the design, use, or analysis of efficient algorithms. We encourage submissions from researchers in the discrete mathematics, and experimental and applied algorithms communities.  
 Submission Format  
 Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. The submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. The submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics researchers. Proofs must be provided which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, references, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.  
 The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 ½ x 11 inch) paper.  
 A submission that deviates from these guidelines risks summary rejection without consideration of its merits. All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and selected subreviewers, although the program committee may also interact with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to learn about closely related submissions.  
 Papers eligible for the Best Student Paper award should indicate their eligibility at the time of submission. There is a box provided for this purpose on the submission server. Note that any paper whose authors are all full-time students at the time of submission is eligible for the award. Visit the Special Events page  for details.  
 The Program Committee will distribute acceptance notices and final paper submission instructions to authors of accepted papers by early October 2024. These instructions must be followed to ensure inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 SIAM will distribute a follow-up notice and post a list of accepted papers in October 2024.  
 Simultaneous Submissions  
 Results previously published in another conference proceedings or journal (or scheduled for publication prior to SODA) will not be accepted at SODA. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with a published proceedings is not allowed. At the time that the author signs SODA's copyright transfer agreement, the author must affirm that no copyright transfer agreement permitting the publication of a similar paper in a journal or elsewhere has been signed.  
 The authors should consult the PC chair in the case of any doubt regarding this policy.  
 Paper Awards

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 International Workshop  

 SOFA Conferences  
 Soft computing (SC) is a collection of methodologies that are trying to cope with the main disadvantage of the conventional (hard) computing: the poor performances when working in uncertain conditions. The fundamental idea of soft computing is to emulate the human like reasoning. The classic constituents of SC are fuzzy logic, neural network theory and probabilistic reasoning, but new methods are continuously emerging: belief networks, genetic algorithms, anytime algorithms, chaos theory, some parts of learning theory, etc. Due to the large variety and complexity of the domain, the constituting methods of SC are not competing for a comprehensive ultimate solution. Instead they are complementing each other, for dedicated solutions adapted to each specific problem. Hundreds of concrete applications are already available in control, decision making, pattern recognition and robotics. The SC systems are tolerant to imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth. Their main advantages are tractability, robustness, and low cost implementations. At the same time SC is a major developing vector of the Artificial Intelligence.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

  Preface  
   
  These two volumes constitute the Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications, or SOFA 2016, which will be held on August 24–26, 2016, in Arad, Romania. This edition was organized by Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad, Romania, University of Belgrade, Serbia, in conjunction with Institute of Computer Science, Iasi Branch of the Romanian Academy, IEEE Romanian Section, Romanian Society of Control Engineering and Technical Informatics (SRAIT)—Arad Section, General Association of Engineers in Romania—Arad Section and BTM Resources Arad. Soft computing concept was introduced by Lotﬁ Zadeh in 1991 and serves to highlight the emergence of computing methodologies in which the accent is on exploiting the tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty to achieve tractability, robustness, and low solution cost. Soft computing facilitates the use of fuzzy logic, neurocomputing, evolutionary computing and probabilistic computing in combination, leading to the concept of hybrid intelligent systems. Combining of such intelligent systems’ tools and a large number of applications can show the great potential of soft computing in all domains. The volumes cover a broad spectrum of soft computing techniques, theoretical and practical applications ﬁnd solutions for industrial world, economic, and medical problems. The conference papers included in these proceedings, published post conference, were grouped into the following area of research: • Methods and Applications in Electrical Engineering • Knowledge-Based Technologies for Web Applications, Cloud Computing, Security Algorithms and Computer Networks • Biomedical Applications • Image, text and signal processing • Machine Learning and Applications • Business Process Management • Fuzzy Applications, Theory and Fuzzy and Control • Computational Intelligence in Education

  Introduction to Choquet Calculus Michio Sugeno Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan Abstract. In this talk, we give a brief introduction to a recent topic “Choquet calculus” where calculus consists of integrals and derivatives. Modern integrals, namely Lebesgue integrals initiated by Lebesgue in 1902, are associated with the concept of “measures.” Lebesgue measures are deﬁned as additive set functions with certain conditions, and hence, Lebesgue integrals hold additivity by inheriting the property of measures. In the latter half of the twentieth century, a new concept of “measures without additivity” named fuzzy measures was proposed by Sugeno in 1974. Fuzzy measures (non-additive measures in general) are deﬁned as monotone set functions and considered as a natural extension of Lebesgue measures leading to the concept of non-additive integrals with respect to non-additive measures, where we note that monotonicity contains additivity in it. In 1953, Choquet studied the so-called Choquet functionals based on capacities, where capacities representing “potential energy” of a set were also monotone set functions but not captured as “measures” as in the sense of Lebesgue. Together with the appearance of fuzzy measures, Choquet functionals were ﬁnally re-formulated as non-additive integrals with respect to fuzzy measures by Höle in 1982. Since then, various non-additive integrals with respect to non-additive measures have been suggested. Among them, we focus on Choquet integrals which are the most general extension of Lebesgue integrals. Once we obtain the concept of integrals, we become curious about their inverse operations. In the case of Lebesgue integrals, Radon and Nikodym gave Radon-Nikodym derivatives as inverse operations in 1913 and 1930, respectively. It is well-known that with the aid of Radon-Nikodym derivatives, Kolmogorov proved the existence of conditional probabilities in 1933 and thus initiated modern probability theory, where probabilities are nothing but Lebesgue measures. On the other hand in fuzzy measure theory, conditional fuzzy measures have been not well deﬁned in the sense of Kolmogorov. Very recently, inverse operations of Choquet integrals were studied as “derivatives with respect to fuzzy measures” (Sugeno 2013). In this talk, we deal with Choquet calculus (Sugeno 2015) based on Choquet integrals and derivatives. So far, most studies on Choquet integrals have been devoted to a discrete case. In Choquet calculus, we deal with continuous Choquet integrals and derivatives as well. First, we show how to calculate continuous Choquet integrals. To this aim, we consider distorted Lebesgue measures as a special class of fuzzy measures, and nonnegative and non-decreasing functions. The Laplace transformation is used as a basic tool for calculations. Distorted Lebesgue measures are obtained by monotone transformations of Lebesgue measures according to the idea of distorted probabilities suggested by Edwards in 1953. We remember that Kahneman was awarded Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002, where his cumulative prospect theory is based on “Choquet integrals with respect to distorted probabilities.” Next, we deﬁne

  derivatives of functions with respect to distorted Lebesgue measures, where the derivatives correspond to Radon-Nikodym derivatives in the case of Lebesgue integrals. We also discuss the identiﬁcation of distorted Lebesgue measures which is a problem arising particularly in Choquet calculus. Then, we show some relations between Choquet calculus and fractional calculus which is recently getting very popular, for example, in control theory. Also, we consider differential equations with respect to distorted Lebesgue measures and give their solutions. Lastly, we present the concept of conditional distorted Lebesgue measures deﬁned with the aid of Radon-Nikodym-like derivatives.

  Emotional Facial Expressions: Communicative Displays or Psychological Universals? Anna Esposito Department of Psychology, and IIASS, Seconda Università di Napoli, Italy [email protected]  ; [email protected]  http://www.iiassvietri.it/anna.html Abstract. Emotional feelings permeate our everyday experience, consciously or unconsciously, driving our daily activities and constraining our perception, actions, and reactions. During daily interactions, our ability to decode emotional expressions plays a vital role in creating social linkages, producing cultural exchanges, influencing relationships, and communicating meanings. Emotional information is transmitted through verbal (the semantic content of a message) and nonverbal (facial, vocal, gestural expressions, and more) communicative tools and relations and exchanges are highly affected by the way this information is coded/decoded by/from the addresser/addressee. The accuracy above the chance in decoding facial emotional expressions suggested they can play the role of psychological universals. However, this idea is debated by data suggesting that they play the role of social messages dependent upon context and personal motives. These open questions are discussed in this talk, at the light of experimental data obtained from several experiments aimed to assess the role of context on the decoding of emotional facial expressions. The reported data support more the idea that facial expressions of emotions are learned to efﬁciently and effectively express intentions and negotiate relations, even though particular emotional aspects show similarities across cultural boundaries. Research devoted to the understanding of the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in the decoding of emotional states during interactional exchanges is particularly relevant in the ﬁeld of Human-Human, Human-Computer Interaction and Robotics, for building and hardenind human relationships, and developing friendly, emotionally, and socially believable assistive technologies.

  Soft Data Analysis Based on Cluster Scaling Mika Sato-Ilic University of Tsukuba, Japan [email protected]  Abstract. There is a growing need to analyze today’s vast and complex societal data; however, conventional data analysis that is dependent on statistical methods cannot deal with the frequently complex data types that make up this data. As early as 2000, the following six challenges were reported as important future challenges in the core area statistical research in the twenty-ﬁrst century. The six challenges pointed out are (1) scales of data, (2) data reduction and compression, (3) machine learning and neural networks, (4) multivariate analysis for large p, small n (high dimension low sample size data), (5) Bayes and biased estimation, and (6) middle ground between proof and computational experiment. Soft data analysis which is soft computing-based multivariate analysis is the core area in which to combine conventional statistical methods and machine learning or data mining methods, and has a strong capability to solve the statistical challenges in the twenty-ﬁrst century. In soft data analysis, we have developed cluster-scaled models which use the obtained cluster as the latent scale for explaining data. While the original scale does not have the capacity to work as the scale for complex data, a scale that is extracted from the data itself will have the capability to deal with the vast and complex data. This presentation outlines the problems and challenging issues of statistical data analysis caused by the new vast and complex data, how our cluster-scaled models are related with these issues, and how the models solve the problems with some applications.

  Why the Brain Can and the Computer Can’t Biology Versus Silicon Valeriu Beiu Universitatea “Aurel Vlaicu” din Arad, Romania [email protected]  Abstract. This presentation aims to follow on von Neumann’s prescient “The Computer and the Brain” (Yale Univ. Press, 1958) and—relying on the latest discoveries—to explain how the Brain achieves ultra-low power and outstandingly high reliability (nano-)computing, while our silicon-based computers cannot. The tale will be reversed as starting from the brain, and in particular from very fresh experimental results, for information processing and communication. We shall proceed from the gated ion channels which are the nano-switches of the brain. Understanding the ways, ion channels communicate will allow analyzing the statistical behaviors of arrays of gated ion channels. These will be followed by unexpected results showing that highly reliable communication using arrays of absolutely random devices is possible at amazingly small redundancy factors ( > < y ¼ y0 þ mt ;t 2 R z ¼ z0 þ nt > > : Ox þ My þ Nz þ P ¼ 0 If Ol þ Mm þ Nn 6¼ 0 means that the system has an unique solution, in other words the intersection between the line and the plan is a single point. B. Eye Tracking System After the exterior detection was performed the system has to do an interior detection, to ﬁnd out the clear position of the driver. The eyes and the face of the driver have to be protected against glare, that’s why we decided to use an eye tracking system for this evaluation. An eye tracking system is usually used to monitor the driver’s loss of attention. It starts with a face detection followed by eye detection and the last step is the evaluation of the eye state [7]. If the face is turned side or the eyes are closed for a few seconds the system alerts the driver by flashing some interior light or through some vibrations in the steering wheel [12]. The head’s and eyes’ movements are monitored with cameras usually equipped with active infrared illumination. The cost of an eye tracking system is high at this moment. Such systems are not installed on the commercial vehicles only the high-end ones dispose of them. In [8] Hong et al. proposed a low cost eye tracking system which has to be placed on the driver’s head. The gaze of the subject is monitored using two cameras and two mirrors installed on the side of the head. Our system needs only the information regarding the position of the head and eyes in order to protect them from the undesired glare phenomenon. So, if the vehicle is not equipped with an eye tracking system an after-market one can be used to point out the position of the driver, like the one presented above. C. Head-up Display Head-up Displays (HUD) are becoming more and more popular, especially on high-class vehicles. If the ﬁrst variants of HUD were able to display only some basic

  9  
   
  information like speed and navigation icons, the latest variants are more complex and can exhibit 3D images, the so called augmented reality technology, such as navigation information, lane guidance or potential dangers. As it was already mentioned, head-up display were basically designed to display useful information in the driver’s ﬁeld of view in order to discard any kind of distraction. A HUD with the characteristics of projecting unlimited combination of images without any ﬁxed dial’s position [10] is the desired solution for our system in order to reduce the glare effect on driver’s vision. Comparing to most of the existing commercial head-up displays, the one used in our system has to able to deal with 3 constrains: • to be dynamically adjustable on both axis, x and y • to dynamically adjust the image opacity based on the sun brightness intensity • to dynamically adjust the size of the projected image All these three conditions can be fulﬁlled with the new generation of HUD, based on DLP technology [11] without any hardware change, only a few software improvements are needed which mean very low costs. In [9] Wientapper et al. proposed a head-up display variant which has as input information the viewer’s head position in order to display the image in the ideal position for the driver. If such a HUD with internal calibration becomes reality on the commercial vehicles, the complexity of our proposed system decreases, being no need of an additional eye tracking system. In Fig. 6 is illustrated the result of rejecting glare from the image. The system gathers the data from the light sensor and eye tracking system and projects an adjusted image (in opacity and size) on the windshield.

  4 System Deployment - Functionality In this section will be explained the functionality of the Digital Sunshade based the below flow chart (Fig. 7). Our proposal is to let the driver to decide if he wants to use the head-up display functionality or the digital sunshade functionality because both functionalities can’t work in parallel.

  When the digital sunshade functionality is chosen, the sun tracking system starts the monitoring. If on the windshield’s surface is detected brighter light than the predeﬁned threshold, the system gets the data from the sun sensor regarding the sun position. Beside the information regarding to the sun position, the sun tracking system has to offer also information regarding the light intensity level and the size of the spot which has to be covered. When the system detects light on the windshield it automatically starts also an interior detection, to ﬁnd out if the sun rays are disturbing the driver. If they do, all these information are sent to the ECU in order to initiate the projection process. The head-up display integrated in this system has to be able to project light in every point of the windshield. The ECU conﬁgures the image which has to be displayed based on the information gathered from the sun tracking system (position, brightness level and size of the spot) and eye tracking system (driver’s position). These data are sent to the head-up display which projects an adapted image (opacity and size) so that the entire disturbing area to be covered (see Fig. 6).  
   
  5 Conclusions Sometimes light and solar energy is useful, such as for agriculture [13], but the car driving sunshine deﬁnitely bothers us. In this paper is presented a new concept of an anti-glare system able to protect the driver against the annoying sun rays no matter where these are crossing the windshield. Nowadays the solution for the glare problem is the sun visor, but its biggest drawback is that it can protect only the top area of the windshield. Unfortunately the glare phenomenon is unpredictable; we have to go against the sun rays crossing directly the windshield surface but also with sun rays reflected from a wet or icy road. For the latter category the sun visor is useless. The automotive companies are working hard to ﬁnd a solution for this problem; the one proposed until now, with an integrated thin ﬁlm, is expensive from the manufacturing point of view.

  We analyzed the problem together with the state of the art and we concluded that the proposed method can be a cost-efﬁcient variant. The system is able to protect the driver against glare, no matter where the rays are hitting the windshield, and is also reasonable from the cost point of view because we used equipments already installed in the vehicle, we only gave them new functionalities: using the GPS system and some light sensors we detected the sun position, with the eye tracking system we indicated the driver’s position and in the last phase with the help of a head-up display we project an image on the windshield in the disturbing area. Furthermore, using the same principles exhibited above, the system can be improved such as to become useful also for headlamps glaring.

  1 Introduction We are living in an era of computers and machines and they all communicate with each other using binary information “0” and “1”, very fast and easy for them, but inappropriate and hard to understand for humans. We have been using computers power and speed to solve a lot of our problems but more and more we realize that there still exist problems that somehow can be better solved by humans. Instead of numerical algorithms we humans use intuition and world knowledge to solve our problems and this is very different from computer’s way of thinking. Therefore we have a gap between our human way of doing things and the computers way. A classical solution to ﬁll this gap is represented by the visual programming languages (VPL) that lets users create their applications graphically, by manipulating basic program elements. In VPLs textual instructions are replaced by spatial arrangements of graphic symbols (blocks) allows programming with visual expressions. The simplest VPL (known as dataflow) are based on “boxes and arrows” approach, where entities are represented as boxes and the relations between them by arrows, lines or arcs. The objective of our work is to facilitate the design and the development of general purpose expert systems with a very friendly, fast and portable VPL.  
   
  2 On the Expert Systems Expert systems were introduced by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by Edward Feigenbaum, who is sometimes referred as the “father of expert systems”. E. Feigenbaum, said that the key insight of early expert systems was that “intelligent

  systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the speciﬁc formalisms and inference schemes they use” [1]. The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases (Mycin) and identifying unknown organic. Until then, research had been focused on attempts to develop very general-purpose problem solvers such as those described by Allen Newell and Herb Simon [2]. In addition to Feigenbaum key early contributors were Edward Shortliffe, Bruce Buchanan, and Randall Davis. Expert systems were among the ﬁrst truly successful forms of AI software [3–7]. Research on expert systems was also active in France. In the US the focus tended to be on rule-based systems, ﬁrst on systems hard coded on top of LISP programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as IntelliCorp. In France research focused more on systems developed in Prolog. The advantage of expert system shells was that they were easier for non-programmers to use. The advantage of Prolog environments was that they weren’t focused only on IF-THEN rules. Prolog environments provided a much fuller realization of a complete First Order Logic environment [x]. In the 1980s, expert systems proliferated. Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the Fortune 1000 companies applied the technology in daily business activities. Interest was international with the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project in Japan and increased research funding in Europe. In 1981 the ﬁrst IBM PC was introduced, with the MS-DOS operating system. The imbalance between the relatively powerful chips in the highly affordable PC compared to the much more expensive price of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time created a whole new type of architecture for corporate computing known as the client-server model. Using a PC, calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe. This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications. As a result, client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market. Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop. They were a natural ﬁt for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts. Up until that point the primary development environment for expert systems had been high end Lisp machines from Xerox, Symbolics and Texas Instruments. With the rise of the PC and client server computing vendors such as IntelliCorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools. In addition new vendors often ﬁnanced by Venture Capital started appearing regularly. These new vendors included Aion Corporation, Neuron Data, Exsys, and many others. In the 1990s and beyond the term “expert system” and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon. There are two interpretations of this. One is that “expert systems failed”: the IT world moved on because expert systems didn’t

  deliver on their over hyped promise, the fall of expert systems was so spectacular that even AI legend Rishi Sharma admitted to cheat in his college project regarding expert systems, because he didn’t consider the project worthwhile [x], the other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success. As IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines such tools migrated from standalone tools for the development of special purpose “expert” systems to one more tool that an IT professional has at their disposal. Many of the leading major business application suite vendors such as SAP, Siebel and Oracle integrated expert system capabilities into their suite of products as a way of specifying business logic. Rule engines are no longer simply for deﬁning the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic. They often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments.  
   
  3 BES, the Basic Expert System BES (Basic Expert System) is a new visual fuzzy-expert system development shell belonging to the VPL family that ﬁlls the gap between human expertise and the computer way of “thinking” by using a graphical approach instead of algorithms and code. If using BES it is possible for the human expert to create and design his own expert system by representing the knowledge base in a graphical manner, that is easy to understand and easy to make. After creating an expert system, BES runs it in real time, so the human expert may test very easy the entire application, without concerning about the inference engine that is behind the scene. A reference product when creating BES was VisiRule, created by LPA (Logic Programming Associates), and our concrete objective was to make portable standalone applications extremely fast and easy to build.  
   
  4 The BES Tomato Disorder Diagnostic Expert System Several applications were already developed with BES, which proved to be extremely friendly and effective in all senses. The most complex of these application is a Tomato Disorder Diagnostic Expert System, which is relying on the expert knowledge provided by Texas AgriLife [8] (Figs. 1, 2 and 3).

  Introduction  
   
  The correct management of electrical power asks to establish and know in each moment the state of power cables. The operation of electrical power network assumes state parameters so diﬀerent that detecting of faults is practical impossible without removing the cables set out of voltage. More, knowing the behavior in time of power cables is a combined result where found it also the work regime of given subsystem. An overview of the research and reported technical solutions allows the identiﬁcation of the stages already presented. It is to emphasize that a special attention is paid to technical solutions which allow the cables fault detection [1,5,7–9,11]. It is obvious that they are studied particular faults which can be detected in particular situations. In all these situations, the power cable is seen as a part of an electric circuit. By means of some ad-hoc scheme sit is possible to detect and locate the faults. The faults in power cable are short-circuits, damaged insulation, interruption. The theoretical grounds are very simple, but the technical solutions are depending of the quality of technical means, especially the sensitivity of measurements means. c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E.

  So, the research goal is to develop a predictive diagnosis system. The searched technical solutions will be able that, together with the measurement means, to ensure the decisional support necessary to process data, information and knowledge able to describe the technical system of power cables. The prediction issue is an important one because once the prediction accurate achieved [2,6,10] it allows arguing decision-making processes which can be well implemented inclusively in automatic work regimes. The prediction, as anticipating technique, is less dependent of phenomena and application ﬁelds as long as the interest variables are eﬃciently measured. The found solutions are alternative manners to be used in diﬀerent applications. The work aims to present the designing and building of an expert system dedicated to diagnose and predict the state of electrical cables in use. First one deﬁnes the problem to be solved. They are approached some theoretical grounds regarding the modeling of dynamical behavior of power cables, of the predictability issue, with direct application on hybrid models and methods able to keep the dynamics inside of hybrid models. A further chapter insist son the ways to operate with hybrid models and next section is dedicated to the functional model of power cable, model which proves to be a hybrid one. The last section includes conclusions on the manner to build and use an intelligent diagnoses and prediction system dedicated to power cables. Some points of view to be used further in order to capitalize the suggested solution are also introduced.

  The Issue of Underground Power Cables Monitoring Sustainable Development and Technical Achievements  
   
  Sustainable development is a concept that is opposed to growth, seemingly bound-less consumerism, to the contempt for the earth’s resources. Sustainable development is a reaction to more frequent and alarming signals of those who invoke the need to protect the environment. When talking about sustainable development, a special concerned class of technical achievements are those that are built for permanent use, for a considerable time period, have a particularly important role in daily life, undertaken with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and material eﬀorts. Such achievements are the dams, the bridges, and infrastructure parts of water supply systems, power, oil and gas networks, and communication systems. All these achievements are parts of complex systems, with large size and density, with high resources concentration, often in areas of large human agglomerations. These technical systems are very similar and have some common features: (i) They require very important investments. (ii) They are serving large human communities and are unique, i.e. not necessarily involve alternative to take their services if special circumstances occur (technical functional redundancy).  
   
  20

  (iii) They cover services which do not involve permanent interruptions allowing lasting interventions. (iv) They are diﬃcult to follow as operating state due to environments where they are implanted. (v) In terms of constructive manner point of view, they have special features that are rarely found in other systems, making them unique or little studied. Among these means of technical support of the civilization, the subject of current research is focusing on the underground power cables. It appears easily that these technical systems fulﬁll abundantly the conditions listed above. 2.2  
   
  Underground Power Cable as Technical System  
   
  Underground power cable appears as a means to transport electric energy. Of the physical point of view, the power cable acts as a resistance, at most as a electrical impedance. From the technical point of view, however, the power cable is a mechanical assembly that operates under the electric and electromagnetic ﬁelds action. The cable contains layers of diﬀerent materials for roles of mechanical protection of the conductor itself as in Fig. 1. 1 2 3 4

  During operation, under the action of physical-chemical factors in the environment, in the cable occurs corrosion phenomena. These phenomena provoke degradations of the outer covering which further propagate to the active conductor. In time, the consequence of the corrosive action of environment is the emergence of possibilities of electrical undesirable interactions with the environment. These interactions, called currently faults, provoke the destructive eﬀects of electricity, mainly, melting and evaporation of the materials involved. The faults occurrence means the interruption of power supply. The time duration of the interruption comprises the fault identiﬁcation and location, the period of intervention preparation and the duration to eliminate the fault. In this duration, it is required, if possible, that the beneﬁciary, the consumer of electric power to be supplied from alternative sources, most often by switching other electrical functional subnets. It should be added that power networks are comprised of segments of cables that make up subnets between power substations. The discussion of this paper is limited to the power end consumers and suppliers groups, residential or industrial. It is to remember that maintenance of a network of power cables assumes high costs, both in terms of identiﬁcation and location fault, and from the point of view of intervention. 2.3  
   
  Monitoring the Faults in Underground Power Cables  
   
  Hereinafter, the treatment of faulty underground power cable relates to the fault detection and location. The two actions are complementary and necessary. Fault detection requires knowing all its features. From this point of view is talking about short circuits and interruptions. In both cases the normal operation ceases but the consequences are regarding the rest of the network where the fault occurs. Locating the fault involves establishing the spatial coordinates of the place where it occurred. Since the underground power cables are not directly accessible, monitoring of their technical condition is quite always via indirect methods and techniques. Of practical interest particularly enjoys the predictive diagnosis of underground power cables. Predictive diagnostics [3,4] allows early fault detection and location. Such diagnosis is done by using some information on operation and maintenance, mainly resistances and voltages that can be measured within the network. The main parameters and indicators that enable predictive diagnostics are those given in Table 1. Analysis of this information will be carried out in relation with the destination, with the way to obtain, with interpretation and manipulation manner, with representation mode.

  Implementation Details Regarding the Expert System Describing the Knowledge  
   
  A ﬁrst primary analysis of the available information indicates that this information: (a) is non-homogeneous; (b) it is diverse; (c) it comes from multiple sources and requires preliminary processing. Another characterization of available information is considering its purpose. The available information is used to ensure the prediction of life expectancy of underground power cables. Ensuring the life of the cable corresponds with an indirect anticipation of the moment of the next fault. 3.2  
   
  Principle of Using the Knowledge  
   
  The lack of homogeneity of the information underlying the decision-making process regarding the life of power cable requires the use of an expert system. Its main functions are: (i) Gathering primary information on a power cable according the template and value domains in Table 1 with examples of some situations as in Table 4. (ii) Saving of parameters of the cable introduced at operators option. (iii) Printing the information for a cable introduced into the system together with the conclusion on its state.  
   
  24  
   
  D. Isoc  
   
  The expert system involves a set of interactions that will be detailed in relation to the activities developed in cooperation with the human operator. Expected life of the cable is determined in relation to a set of values of predicted inﬂuence factors. As a rule, these inﬂuence factors parameters are obtained in relation to the nearest cable model found in the knowledge base and to the value of reference inﬂuence factor that the parameter has on the life of the cable: Real f actor =  
   
  Real parameter × Ref erence f actor Ref erence parameter  
   
  (1)  
   
  The expert system is based on the principles set out in [4] and [3] respectively. This requires the establishment of the implementation details to ensure operation within the expected limits. The expert is prepared to use the information in Table 1. This information corresponds to the used model. The same information can be provided by the user as a result of his relevant measurements. From Table 1 it follows how the designer provides connections between values and ways of interaction with the operator as in Table 2. In the information framework as in Table 1, there are a number of situations where the nature of the information should be speciﬁed because it must be validated during operation. A designation of some of these situations is given in Table 3. The established relations are those that customize the processing manner with the operation and ensure the speciﬁcity of the interaction way of implementing of expert system.

  (i) That the information on underground cables is comprised of two distinct sets: (a) a set of information obtained directly by measurements or factual ﬁndings; (b) a set of information relating to the inﬂuence factor associated to measured parameter during the normal operation of underground cable. (ii) That it is established how to get information on the analyzed cable, i.e. from human operator by direct input and validation for numerical information or from human operator by selecting, for other kind of information. In special situations, there is a possibility of open format, especially for information that is not relevant to processing but only for identifying the work cases. (iii) That the information entered by the operator is operated by intermediate information associated to inﬂuence factors on the normal life of the cables. In fact, this information is the expert system work manner and assumes the included expertise that can not be described directly in the working mechanism of expert system. In Table 1 there is a large amount of information to be processed. Much of this information is entered by a human operator in two diﬀerent situations. The ﬁrst situation is where the human operator wants to introduce in the knowledge base of expert system a new piece of knowledge. The knowledge identiﬁes to a new cable. The second situation is where the human operator introduces the situation of a cable to be analyzed and treated by means of information known by the expert system. In all cases, decisive is the way to build the cable model that is given by means of the set of inﬂuence factors acting together with the characteristic variables, known as attributes, on the value of the life of the cable. In analyzing the data in Table 1 it is necessary to point out that here, in the white ﬁelds, is the measurable information or information that can be collected and each is provided with a weighting factor. Weighting factors present in the gray cells are defaults as value domain and they emphasize the importance that the informed user, the human expert, gives to the variables associated to the attributes of knowledge face to the possible complex relation to get the life of the cable. In preparing the connection between human operator and expert system important is to point the manner of treatment of information. This responsibility

In the information that appears in Table 1 exists a number of situations where the nature of information should be speciﬁed because it will be validated during operation. A designation of some of representative cases is given in Table 3. In certain situations in Table 1 shall apply some notations to be used when the parameter are diﬃcult to introduce into a simpliﬁed table, in which case are allowed notations as in Table 4. 3.3  
   
  Implementing the Working Algorithm  
   
  For best results in predicting the cable life expectancy, each cable is described by a table which has elements associated with the relevant information for describing the cable, but also for its operation. It is assumed that one works with a reference cables Cai that have the parameters {pai1 , pai2 , pai3 , pai 4} and the value of the cable life expectation is pai0 . In relation to this reference cable is considered another cables for which were achieved measurements where from the parameter set is {pax1 , pax2 , pax3 , pax4 }. It is seeking to determine the predicted lifetime px0 of the given cable. The assumption implied by the prediction method is that each parameter intervenes on the cable life expectation by an inﬂuence factor {wi1 , wi2 , wi3 , wi4 }, value resulting from appreciation heuristic. This is the reason why all the information on a reference cable Cai , i.e. its parameters, paij , j = 1 · · · m, is entered into the reference data base as in Table 1. Be a case where it is a Cai reference cable with a number of m = 4 parameters. In this case the associated parameter structure is formed with the values: Cai (1, 1) = pi1 ; Cai (1, 2) = wi1 ; Cai (2, 1) = pi2 ; Cai (2, 2) = wi2 ; Cai (3, 1) = pi3 ; Cai (3, 2) = wi3 ;  
   
  Expert System for Predictive Diagnosis (1) Principles and Knowledge Base  
   
  27  
   
  Cai (4, 1) = pi4 ; Cai (4, 2) = wi4 ; Cai (5, 1) = pi0 ; Cai (5, 2) = 1; In order to achieve a predictive diagnosis, the cable Cax is considered. For this cable, the life expectation is seeking and that one builds its own array of values: Cax (1, 1) = pax1 ; Caxi (1, 2) = wx1 ; Cax (2, 1) = pax2 ; Caxi (2, 2) = wx2 ; Cax (3, 1) = pax3 ; Caxi (3, 2) = wx3 ; Cax (4, 1) = pax4 ; Caxi (4, 2) = wx4 ; where the cable life and operating time is kept in the table raw Cax (5, 1) = pax0 which corresponds to Cax (5, 2) = wx and where wx =  
   
  wx1 + wx2 + wx3 + wx4 wi1 + wi2 + wi3 + wi4  
   
  (2)  
   
  pax0 = pai0 × wx  
   
  (3)  
   
  and The weights {wx1 , wx2 , wx3 , wx4 } can be determined in two ways: – by reporting the parameters of cable to the parameters of reference cable as: wx1 =  
   
  pax1 pai1  
   
  pax2 pai2 pax3 = pai3 pax4 = pai4  
   
  (4)  
   
  wx2 =  
   
  (5)  
   
  wx3  
   
  (6)  
   
  wx4  
   
  (7)  
   
  – by other computing relationships into which, for example, one ﬁnds the relationships between measured parameters as in the manner: wx1 = f1 (pax1 , pax2 , pax3 , pax4 )  
   
  (8)  
   
  wx2 = f2 (pax1 , pax2 , pax3 , pax4 )  
   
  (9)  
   
  wx3 = f3 (pax1 , pax2 , pax3 , pax4 )  
   
  (10)  
   
  wx4 = f4 (pax1 , pax2 , pax3 , pax4 )

  The above situation corresponds to the case where the reference base has a single cable or a search has been found that the closest to the examined cable of Cax is the i - th cable, i.e. Cai . Now it considers that the reference cable base, with the same number of parameters, comprises the cables Ca1 , Ca2 , Ca3 to which the analyzed cable Cax is reported in order to predict its life expectation. The parameter array is being built in parallel as shown in Table 5. According to the principle of prediction, it must be found the Ci cable that is most similar to the analyzed cable, Cx in terms of all description parameters. Once the parameters of analyzed cable i.e. pax1 , pax2 , pax3 , pax4 were determined by measurement or by other way, it follows the stage of selecting the most similar cable. The choice is made by a synthetic indicator resulted for each comparison basis. For reasons of validity, one uses the mean square error and then it follows: – for the Cax and Ca1 cables:  E1 = 0.25 × [(p11 − px1 )2 + (p12 − px2 )2 + (p13 − px3 )2 + (p14 − px4 )2 ] (12) – for the Cax and Ca2 cables:  E2 = 0.25 × [(p21 − px1 )2 + (p22 − px2 )2 + (p23 − px3 )2 + (p24 − px4 )2 ] (13) – for the Cax and Ca3 cables:  E3 = 0.25 × [(p31 − px1 )2 + (p32 − px2 )2 + (p33 − px3 )2 + (p34 − px4 )2 ] (14) With the degree of similarity between the analyzed cable and each reference known, the selection process is capable of determining the most similar cable, that is of the cable with the i-index and so that the value of synthetic index of similarity is maximized: i = arg mini (E1 , E2 , E3 )

  We can identify two situations: – If there is only one cable to the one observed, be it Ca2 . In this situation, the predicted life expectation of analyzed cable is given in terms of the inﬂuence factors of the parameters on its and the global inﬂuence factor of the analyzed cable wx : wx1 + wx2 + wx3 + wx4 wx = (16) w21 + w22 + w23 + w24 concretely pax0 = pa20 × wx (17) – If there are more similar cables with the analyzed cable, be them Ca1 and Ca3 . In this situation, cable life expectation will result as a weighted average pax0 = pa10

  Context and knowledge are the eﬀect of a life experience or an experience veriﬁed by an expert or, generally, of a connoisseur. Operation of an expert system dedicated to prediction allows that for a new context, to anticipate the conclusion or the knowledge that can be reached. The associated algorithm is given in Table 6. From the algorithm shown in Table 6 it can be ascertained that: (i) each known cable is a piece of knowledge; (ii) the pieces of knowledge have many component types; (iii) the component parts of the piece of knowledge are of many types: nonnumerical data, experimental determined numerical data, numerical data determined by calculating using indirect ways; (iv) each component part of each piece of knowledge intervenes in reality describing by means of a weighting or inﬂuence factor. The weighting factors are unique for a given knowledge base and they are depending of the accumulated expertise of its users. (v) each piece of knowledge enters in the inference result in term with the similarity degree of analyzed cable with the given piece of knowledge.

  Here are recognizable the modules and functional connections of the expert system. The knowledge base as KB is one that comprises an expertise organized as a set of n conﬁrmed experiments described by sheets constructed as in Table 1. This expertise matches a set of cables for which is known the characterization information and the life of operation. Each piece of knowledge P 1, P 2, · · · consists of a context, Cx1, Cx2, · · · and an associated knowledge K1, K2, · · · . The purpose of the expert system is to determine the K0 knowledge that could correspond to known context, Cx0 . In order to do that, one seeks to select the situations in knowledge base KB that are most close with the given problem and so, ﬁlling the piece of knowledge, P0 . The process of determining follows the course of the selection process which is done in a selection unit, SU under the control of a selection control unit SCU . Through selectors S1, S2, · · · , Sn the context of knowledge pieces is compared with the context of the problem knowledge piece, P0 . At the end of selection, an enabling unit, AU allows to these s leq n knowledge pieces to access an inference machine, IE. Through inference algorithm described in Table 6 the inference engine predicts the expectation life the presented problem presented and complements the knowledge piece P0 with the knowledge K0.

  Concluding Remarks  
   
  In this paper one argues the achievement principles of a knowledge base of an expert system dedicated to predictive diagnosis, that is the evaluation of the life expectation of a power cable working underground an is subjected to corrosion. It is ascertained that modeling of underground power cable requires a signiﬁcant amount of non-homogeneous information of individual natures. The knowledge base is built of cables about one knows how they have evolved over time and operate or the accidents that have aﬀected. It is anticipated that the manner of using of knowledge will be by means of an expert system that works by making a weighted average of numerical information representing the available knowledge. The ﬁnal value of the predicted cable life expectation requires knowledge as numerically weighted on values with associated signiﬁcance following procedures or experiences. Each cable known formerly the prediction is one knowledge piece and contributes to determining the value of life expectation. The structure and operating manner of designed expert system are as the standard, but the inference algorithm is a speciﬁc one and works with speciﬁc knowledge pieces.

  Abstract. Once the conceptual part deﬁned and established, developing an expert system assumes steps of engineering in the context of practices and procedures. Obviously, the already achieved expert system requires adjustments and reﬁnements involving a signiﬁcant eﬀort. There are given principles to design the man-machine interface and the operating algorithm. Follows specifying the principles of testing technologies and then build it, together with the test data.

  Introduction  
   
  In general, the development of an expert system is treated mostly by mathematical grounds and of treating of knowledge. Rarely, details as man-machine interface and system testing are considered as objects worthy of attention for scientiﬁc research. We take advantage of the fact that expert system for diagnosis of electrical underground power cables is an application suﬃciently specialized to be described fully, including the ways of construction of the solution its manmachine interface and how it was built testing technology together with the test data set. Among the applications that were the basis of documenting, there is an adaptive application [6] in the sense that the interface is built on the latest operated applications. The diagnostic expert system is characterized by the need to complete the entire set of information and then, by activating a simple inference engine. In this way such a solution is not justiﬁed. Comparative analysis of [9] shows a big diﬀerence between interfaces made in universities and the commercial products. It is noted especially the complexity of products made in universities. It also noted the most abundant use of techniques and details in interfaces achieved in universities, such as graphic objects, mouse, c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E. Balas et al.

  screen, text editing, use of hypertext and gesture recognition. One explanation might be the lack of a pertinent, realistic vision on the eﬀective use of a manmachine interface. Is also noteworthy that, despite the growing number of expert systems in recent years, research reported in graphical user interfaces exist, especially in 80–90 years [5,7,10]. By intent, it is distinguished paper [8] where it one put a synthesis of conceptual issues that could form the basis for human-machine interfaces. However, the main conclusion is that which would be required depends on the design methodology which does not really exist. In the absence of methodologies to build man-machine interface for application to develop expert systems, the author believes that it is useful to approach the issue and solve it the most explicitly. In this context, the ﬁrst conclusion of the author is that for a rational use and within the limits of its intended destination as diagnostic expert systems, the man-machine interface must be designed by one who knows both the knowledge base and the way of thinking of the user. It also retains the assembly ergonomicseﬀective operation need-algorithmic description. Together with the man-machine interface it is approached the developing of testing technology and the developing of test data set. In the ﬁrst part of the paper are given details of man-machine interface, including its speciﬁcation. In a second part are given the test principles of expert system and further are introduced two relevant case studies for testing technology and test data set choice. Finally, one concentrates the conclusions of this approach to build the expert system for predictive diagnostics.

  Details on Specification and Building a Man-Machine Interface for an Expert System  
   
  In general, between the expert system and the human operator there is a speciﬁc action. The interaction is guided by the man-machine interface. It is profoundly wrong to consider that an eﬀective interface can be derived from a general purpose interface or the human-machine interface system should enjoy all the amenities of a general purpose product-program. 2.1  
   
  General Functions  
   
  The interface is a constructive detail of the expert system that gives it accessibility and, ﬁnally, the acceptability of the beneﬁciaries. In this situation, the interface is built having in mind hypothesis of industrial implementation, but the product is made in minimal technological conditions to ensure the operation according to the stated principles. Functions which the interface has to provide are: i. Reception and validation of information that characterizes the cable to be analyzed. In order to receive the requested knowledge is deﬁned the information to be introduced by the human operator as in Table 1.  
   
  36

  ii. The possibility that the operator can simply act to attain the expert system goal without having any special training. iii. The possibility of software to be easily tested, especially since it is an expert system operating with complex knowledge. iv. The possibility that the solution oﬀered by the expert system to be justiﬁed in the sense indicated by the element of knowledge base that was considered like closest to the present analyzed case. The expert system interacts with the operator by means of several actions: i. entering data for the purposes of characterizing analyzed cable by measurable parameters; ii. operative activation of commands to achieve desired actions; iii. input date validation; iv. reporting the parameters of analyzed cable and of resulted solution, respectively of predicted lifetime. In Table 2 are deﬁned selectors that should be provided for the expert system dedicated to analysis and life prediction of underground power cables. In Table 3 are described the eﬀects of commands and how they interact with other possible actions. 2.2  
   
  Building the Interface of Expert System  
   
  Expert system interface is designed to implement deﬁned commands. The principle that it respects the interface is that its users have enough freedom of action in a deﬁned framework of limitations and safeguards. In Fig. 1 is given the expert system’s main board. It is ascertained that there is a part for working parameters. It was chosen that this sub-screen have dual utility. It is to remember that maintenance of a network of power cables assumes high costs, both in terms of identiﬁcation and location fault, and from the point of view of intervention.

  Testing and Using the Expert System  
   
  Testing an expert system is a necessity before it is placed in service. There is no single test technology. In the literature, which is recommended, in diﬀerent forms [1–4], is going through all routes leading from premises to conclusions. Such exhaustive testing is suitable for expert systems that work on a limited and predeﬁned knowledge base. In this case it is a diﬀerent kind of expert system. First, the knowledge base is not limited but it enriches by means of accumulated experience. Accumulation of knowledge can be done from the outside from accumulated experiences or by including situations already considered and solved.

  When tests an expert system it should keep in mind that behind the results are more knowledge together with the rules of use. Components of knowledge pieces are at least of a three categories: (a) numerical with direct assignment, (b) calculated based on predeﬁned account relationships and (c) other, basically logical. It is noteworthy that the component parts of knowledge pieces have not identical relations with the lifetime of the analyzed cable. This makes the testing technology still more complicated. It is noted that veriﬁcation test should be performed with a large number of cases, that reference cables and checking the components parts of knowledge to be ‘practiced’, that is to have many values. 3.1  
   
  Organizing of Testing  
   
  In these circumstances, the test is regarded by examples. In a superﬁcial manner, testing is exempliﬁed by construction the tests as below: Test 1. The cable has identical parameters with the parameters of ﬁrst of the analyzed reference cables of the knowledge base. It may be noted that there are three tables that relate to cable analyzed (Table 1) which includes the solution of expert system, the knowledge base describing the set of reference cables (Table 2) and a table that allows the evaluation of details that refers to the joining of analyzed cable and the reference cable.

It is ascertained that when the parameters of analyzed cable are identical to those of a cable of the set of reference cables, the lifetime of analyzed cable is the same of the reference situation of Table 3.

  The above two situations are part of the tests battery that was built to validate the achieved expert system. From this point of view, it is considered that the assessment succeeded. Regarding the information in Table 1 is to remember some details: i. The introduction of information on the analyzed cable involves both objective information, and entering the values of inﬂuence factors. ii. Information on all parameters of cable, inclusively of inﬂuence factors, may be partially in the sense that the expert system assigns defaults. In this way the system can cope with imprecise information. The existence of inﬂuence factors covers that knowledge of the expert that is doubtful through ignorance regarding the involved physic-chemical phenomena. Diﬀerent values of inﬂuence factors in Table 1 indicate that referred specimens of cables are coming from diﬀerent sources. There, the specialists who assessed them found that they could be the values that they are able to support them. The size of reference cable set is a guarantee of prediction quality. It is obvious that the predicted value is among the available knowledge pieces. Clearly the highlight of the weight to aﬀect each knowledge piece in the ﬁnal outcome is diﬃcult. By the nature of the tasks undertaken testing, the research that might be necessary will be avoided. Test 2 performed mainly based on information from Table 4, makes a check that covers both the theoretical used basis and how to implement a system expert. Construction of the test is based on the assumption that doubling the cable mean load should lead to a half of lifetime of the cable if other parameters are not changed. Tables 3 and 4 have the role of working tools. Together with Table 1 they form the testing technology of the expert system. The task of designing these documents devolve upon the project group. Despite many aspects of fundamental research, these documents are part of professional product documentation and once built the product, it must be sent to the end user. Testing will not be completed with technical reception of expert system. The testing must be repeated after a period of time agreed with beneﬁciary and must be extended to newly entered knowledge pieces whether they are analyzed cables whether they are the results of laboratory research or experimental results.

  On the one hand sub-screens of work parameters is used for inspection, maintenance and updating of the knowledge base. On the other hand, during the analysis, the same sub-screens will provide the ﬁnal result on the position of the predicted lifetime (Table 6). In Fig. 2 one gives the operating sub-screen. This is divided in three key areas. The ﬁrst area is the introduction of a new reference cable or advance under the existing cable base during maintenance. The other two areas correspond to the analysis commands for updating and maintaining the database of reference cables. The third area is for mandatory commands i.e. abandon of last activated command and exit command (Table 7).

  This means that these commands can not be accessed by the other person than having administrator authority. This speciﬁcity is resolved by the existence of an access password. By recognizing the password, the operator can access distinctly analysis command or analysis and the updating commands.

  Testing and Using the Expert System  
   
  Testing an expert system is a necessity before it is placed in service. There is no single test technology. In the literature, which is recommended, in diﬀerent forms [1,3], is going through all routes leading from premises to conclusions. Such exhaustive testing is suitable for expert systems that work on a limited and predeﬁned knowledge base. In this case it is a diﬀerent kind of expert system. First, the knowledge base is not limited but it enriches by means of accumulated experience. Accumulation of knowledge can be done from the outside from accumulated experiences or by including situations already considered and solved. When tests an expert system it should keep in mind that behind the results are more knowledge together with the rules of use. Components of knowledge pieces are at least of a three categories: (a) numerical with direct assignment, (b) calculated based on predeﬁned account relationships and (c) other, basically logical. It is noteworthy that the component parts of knowledge pieces have not identical relations with the lifetime of the analyzed cable. This makes the testing technology still more complicated. It is noted that veriﬁcation test should be performed with a large number of cases, that reference cables and checking the components parts of knowledge to be ‘practiced’, that is to have many values.

  Concluding Remarks  
   
  Once conceptually done, an expert system should be achieved as inference engine but also as human-machine interface. This interface comes to provide to users access to obtain right answers to questions. Achieved interface put together necessary functions and the facility of receiving information on the knowledge pieces that are then exploited. Since the users have diﬀerent authority one creates the user with access to all the information, i.e. including the rights to update the knowledge base, and an ordinary user who has access only to solve key issues that prediction lifetime of underground power cables. Such information is used in development projects of the power supply network. It is grounded and exempliﬁed the testing technology of achieved expert system.

  From the tests set that have been designed and implemented, in work are given two tests. The ﬁrst test is the reproduction of the identical case and the second is to obtain predictable solution based on the information that comes from the expert in problems of corrosion.

  Abstract. The paper is focusing on dynamic transmission network expansion planning (DTNEP). The DTNEP problem has been approached from the retrospective and prospective point of view. To achieve this goal, the authors are developing two software tools in Matlab environment. Power flow computing is performed using conventional methods. Optimal power flow and network expansion are performed using artiﬁcial intelligence methods. Within this ﬁeld, two techniques have been tackled: particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA). The case study refers to a real power system modeled on the Center, Northern, Eastern and Southern parts of the Romanian Power System. Keywords: Power transmission expansion  Software-tool

  1 Introduction The dynamic transmission network expansion planning (DTNEP) is discussed within this paper, in retrospective and prospective manner. A set of network expansion candidates are proposed. The power flow is performed using conventional methods for all scenarios. The optimal power flow (OPF) is computed for the maximum expansion solution (including all the expansion scenarios) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA). Having the optimal maximum expansion solution, the optimal expansion solution is computed also using PSO and GA. For all these purposes own software tools have been developed in Matlab environment. They are able to be linked with other well-known computer aided power system analysis software, importing the power system database. Two types of GAs are used within this paper. Binary coded GA for the expansion planning stage and real coded GA for the OPF. Dynamic programming represents an optimal solution selection methodology considering speciﬁc constraints, following a step-by-step decision process [1, 2]. Discrete dynamic programming with ﬁnite horizon is discussed within the current paper. Decisions are taken at speciﬁc time moments, following a ﬁnite number of computing steps. Currently, within the power engineering ﬁeld, the heuristic and meta-heuristic methods are widely used to solve optimization problems. In case of transmission network expansion planning (TNEP), they are used to generate possible solutions, © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  evaluation and selection of candidates, until the algorithm is not able to ﬁnd a better solution. A reduced mathematical model is their main characteristic. The major drawback refers to the difﬁculties for tuning their parameters. A multi-stage approach of the problem under discussion is tackled in [3]. Authors are proposing a new constructive heuristic approach considering security-constrained TNEP. It is based on a local random search used to select the values of the control variables. It is applied for Ecuadorian and Chilean Power Systems. The major drawback refers to the use of a DC model. In [4] the TNEP is solved as a mixed integer nonlinear non-convex programming model. The optimization is performed based on the differential evolutionary algorithm (DEA). The use of AC load flow model is the great beneﬁt of the paper, providing realist and accurate results. The technique is tested on Garver’s 6 bus and IEEE 24 bus test system. GA based TNEP multi-stage solving is proposed in [5]. The GA is used in conjunction with the probabilistic optimization. The objective function refers to the investment costs, absorption of private investment and system reliability. The case study refers to the IEEE 24 buses test power system. The wind generation is taken into consideration. The TNEP problem influenced by the uncertainties related to wind power generation is also investigated in [6]. In this case the Cuckoo search algorithm is used as an optimization tool. As is stipulated in [7] the use of AC mathematical model has been proposed by only very few researchers. Its complexity is augmented if it is desired to be tackled in the smart grids context. The problem is solved considered the N−1 security criterion. DEA is used and tested on Garver’s 6 bus test power system. In [8] two sources of uncertainties are analyzed in conjunction with TNEP: intermittent renewable energy generation and loads. The objective function terms are represented by the investment and operating costs. The adaptive tabu search algorithm is applied. The AC load flow mathematical model is used and interior point non-linear programing. IEEE 79 buses RTS test system is used as case study. In [9] a comparison is performed between the use of energy storage and N-1 criterion in TNEP studies. The problem is statically approached considering energy storage model, within a system with base load generators and peaking power plants. Four TNEP models are proposed for comparative analysis and N-1 network security constraints. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming problem. IEEE 24 RTS test system is used as case study. A static TNEP mathematical model is proposed in [10]. DC power flow is used. The problem is solved with and without generated power rescheduling. Artiﬁcial bee colony is used as an optimization tool for small IEEE test systems. A long-term TNEP mathematical model is proposed in [11], based on balancing investment costs and reducing consumer costs. To achieve this goal a hierarchical framework is proposed, being sensitive to different agents operating on diverse timelines. An equilibrium model is introduced combining grid operating concerns with the short-term competitive behavior of generating units. According to [12] the use of robust optimization techniques is appreciated compared with stochastic mathematical programming methods in TNEP. Several uncertainties are considered (in order to obtain more realistic results). The mathematical

  model is represented by three-level mixed-integer optimization problem, solved using different strategies. IEEE 24 and 118 buses test systems are used. The discrete PSO approach is used in [13] to solve the TNEP problem. Non-linear mixed optimization model is used with DC power flow. Case studies are represented by IEEE 6 and 24 buses test systems and 46 buses power Brazilian system. [14] deals with DTNEP. The time evolution of the network expansion is provided considering a large number of technical and economic constraints. Results are provided only in synthesis, referring to the power system of Vietnam. Following the introduction presented within the 1st section, the 2nd one refers to the DTNEP methodology. The 3rd section deals with TNEP solving using GAs. The developed software tools are briefly presented within the 4th section. The case study is tackled within the 5th section. The 6th one is focusing on results discussing. Finally, conclusions are synthesized within the 7th section.  
   
  2 Dynamic Network Expansion Planning The DTNEP is discussed for the following time steps: 2015 year– initial stage, 2020, 2025, 2030 – intermediary stages and 2035 – ﬁnal stage. The prospective approach (forward direction) and retrospective one (backward direction) has been considered. Two issues have to be solved: • consumed power forecast correlating the power generation capacity; • admissible solution domain deﬁnition – it contains the network elements’ list that are allowed to be part of the optimal solution for the ﬁnal stage (2035 year). According to the prospective analysis, the starting point refers to the 2015 year. In the following, the expansion solutions are computed step-by-step for the successive years: 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2035. The provided results for 2035 year represent the ﬁnal solution for the entire 20 years analyzed period. The admissible solutions’ domain has been considered to be the maximum expansion one extracting the network elements already introduced for each expansion stage. A static expansion planning solving is applied for each intermediary stage. The non-linear optimization problem is solved using evolutionary techniques: PSO and GA. According to the retrospective analysis, the starting point is represented by the maximum expansion solution, year 2035. In the following, the expansion solutions are computed step-by-step for the successive years: 2035, 2030, 2025 and 2020. The results obtained for 2035 year represents the ﬁnal solution. The comments provided at the prospective analysis for the admissible solution domain deﬁnition and static expansion solving at each intermediary stage are suitable for this case too. The use of both approaches offers the advantage of comparing the intermediary solutions (2020, 2025, 2030 years) and, especially, the ﬁnal one (2035 year). Mathematical model for transmission network expansion planning is presented. Two artiﬁcial intelligence solving techniques have been tackled: PSO and GA. The optimization problem has a multi-criteria character. The following components are included within the global objective function:

  3 Genetic Algorithm (GA) Based TNEP The population represents a set of possible solutions. Each chromosome contains binary digits (0, 1), representing the state for the network expansion candidates. Thus, for this stage we are dealing with binary coded GA.

  The chromosome has d length, being able to be written as: xi ¼ fxi1 ; xi2 ; . . .; xid g;  
   
  i ¼ 1; 2;    ; nc  
   
  ð5Þ  
   
  Each chromosome is evaluated based on the OBF objective function. The computing process ﬁnishes if the solution is not able to be improved. The algorithm stages are the following ones: (a) chromosomes forming the population are randomly initialized with 0 and 1: x0i ¼ fx0i;1 ; x0i;2 ; . . .; x0i;d g;  
   
  i ¼ 1; 2;    ; np  
   
  ð6Þ  
   
  (b) GA based OPF is computed for the conﬁguration coded by each chromosome; (c) initial population is evaluated based on OBF value. The best chromosome is saved in x0elit : f ðx0elit Þ ¼ minfOBFðx0i Þg; i ¼ 1; 2; . . .; nc  
   
  ð7Þ  
   
  (d) for a speciﬁc t computing step (t = 0, 1, 2,…) the chromosomes forming the population subjected to recombination are selected; (e) npr ¼ v  nc =2 chromosome pairs that are subjected to crossover are formed and chromosome pairs that are going to be copied unaltered; (f) offspring are formed starting from the npr pairs subjected to crossover (in one point or in several points); (g) number of chromosome genes subjected to mutation is computed; (h) 1st chromosome belonging to the population obtained at previous step is replaced with the best of the old population: x1t þ 1 ¼ xtelit  
   
  ð8Þ  
   
  (i) OPF is computed for the conﬁgurations coded by each chromosome. Current population is evaluated based on OBF value. New xelit value is computed: þ1 f ðxtelit Þ ¼ minfFOBðxti þ 1 Þg;  
   
  i ¼ 1; 2; . . .; nc  
   
  ð9Þ  
   
  (j) if the OBF value is not able to be improved for a given number of steps, the computing process ﬁnishes. The operating condition corresponding to the last xelit value represents the optimal one. Contrary, computing step is increased with 1 and the algorithm is repeated starting with point c).  
   
  4 Software Tool Two software tools have been developed by the authors in Matlab environment based on PSO and GA approaches: Power OptPowerplanPSO and PowerOptPowerPlanGA. Each one has two modules linked through a graphical user interface:  
   
  52  
   
  A. Simo et al.  
   
  • 1st module – used for OPF (also is able to be used as a stand-alone module); • 2nd module – used for dynamic transmission network expansion planning. PowerOptPowerplanGA’s main window for the OPF module is presented in Fig. 1. Once the power system database has been loaded, the user is able to select the optimization type he desires by selecting the control variables. The lower part of the window allows the user to set the GA parameters: maximum computing steps, capping iterations, population size etc. The main window for the software tool 2nd module (expansion planning module) is presented in Fig. 2. The user has to set the parameters for the GA algorithm: selection type, recombination type etc.

  Fig. 2. PowerOptPowerplanGA – dynamic network expansion window  
   
  Computing-candidates tab allows the user to specify if for each of the power system conﬁgurations corresponding to different expansion candidates, OPF is computed or only power flow. Button labeled Number of expansion stage [years] allows the user to specify the desired number of expansion stages. The entire expansion planning time horizon is going to be divided into the speciﬁed number of years. The results are provided in several ways. They are exported in different ﬁle formats (according to the user’s desire), view on the display or graphically displayed. The 2nd software tool based on PSO is named PowerOptPowerPlanPSO. This one is not discussed within the paper.

The other parts (Western, South-Western and North-Western) have been eliminated. The one-line diagram is presented in Fig. 3 having the following characteristics: • number of buses – 110 (30 PV buses and 80 PQ buses); • number of network elements – 149 divided as: 105 overhead lines of 110, 220 and 400 kV, 44 (auto)transformers; • number of generating units – 30, 23 being real ones and 7 equivalent ones.

  6 Results and Discussions The dynamic transmission network expansion planning is performed (retrospective and prospective approach). This process is step-by-step discussed within the following subsections. 6.1  
   
  Base Case – Year 2015  
   
  Base case has been computed using conventional methods. Bus voltages are ranging between 0.95 and 1.10 p.u. (110 kV, 220 kV), respectively 1 and 1.05 p.u. (400 kV). PV buses terminal voltage limits are set between 0.95 and 1.15 p.u. The total consumed power is Pc = 4172.8 MW, the real generated power Pg = 4289.7 MW and real power losses ΔP = 116.9 MW. 6.2  
   
  Maximum Expansion Solution – Year 2035  
   
  The transmission network expansion planning is discussed for a 20 years, based on the last year consumed power forecast. The 2035 year forecasted peak-evening-winter operating condition is characterized by total real consumed power of 7473 MW (in comparison with 4172.8 MW for the base case), respectively reactive power 2945 MVAr (compared with 1999.9 MVAr). For load fulﬁlment the following generating units have been introduced: • 330 MW units at 28061 (2), 28904 (2), 28021 (3) 28022 (2) buses; • 220 MW units at 28077 (2) bus; • wind farms injecting power in 28017 (600 MW), 28974 (200 MW), 28019 (160 MW) and 28080 (100 MW) buses. A number of 23 new transmission network elements (20 OHLs and 3 autotransformers) have been introduced (considered as candidates within the expansion list). Thus, the expansion scenario is the following one: • new 400 kV buses at 28040, 28062 and 28908; • 400/220 kV 400 MVA (auto)transformers in substations 28061–28062 (2 units) and 28907–28908; • new 400 kV OHL 28037–28040, 28040–28082, 28031–28908, 28908 – 28016; • 220 kV OHL upgraded to 400 kV: 28082–28950, 28950–28025, 28905–28906, 28906–28908; • 400 kV OHL additional circuit at 28016–28973, 28022–28024; • 220 kV OHL additional circuit at 28045–28061, 28061–28057, 28057–28055, 28087–28086 (2), 28086–28085, 28085–28084, 28084–28083, 28083–28078, 28078–28024. Using the software tool PowerOptPlanGA the optimal power flow – OPF has been computed for the maximum expansion solution. Real power losses are equal to ΔP = 191.8 MW, compared to 225.1 MW for the maximum expansion solution base case. Thus, about 15% decreasing has been recorded.

  The GA algorithm evolution for OPF is presented in Fig. 4. The OBF individual best values are presented using blue colour for each computing step. The OBF average value for the entire population is represented using green colour. The OBF value, corresponding to the worst solution, is represented using red colour. An accentuated decrease of the OBF value is recorded during the 1st 50 computing steps. The solution is slightly improved for the next computing steps. Although we are dealing with a large scale power system, the number of the computing steps required for the solution computing is reduced. This fact proves the correctness of the GA parameters’ tuning.

  Optimal Expansion Solution  
   
  • Retrospective approach Before TNEP the load forecast for 20 years period (2015–2035) has been performed. The results are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Consumed power forecasting 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035

  The starting point is represented by the maximum expansion solution, year 2035 and the expansion solutions for all the stages: 2035, 2030, 2025 and 2020. The solution admissible domain for each dynamic expansion stage has been deﬁned based on the previous results. For DTNEP the PowerOptPowerPlanGA software tool has been used. The following elements have been found for the optimal expansion solution: • new 400 kV buses at 28040, 28062 and 28908; • 400/220 kV 400 MVA (auto)transformers in substations 28061–28062 (2 units) and 28907–28908; • new 400 kV OHL 28037–28040, 28040–28082 (alternative solution – double circuit 220 kV OHL), 28031–28908, 28908–28016; • 220 kV OHL upgraded to 400 kV: 28082–28950, 28950–28025; • 220 kV OHL additional circuit at 28061–28057, 28057–28055, 28087–28086 (2), 28086–28085, 28083–28078, 28078–28024 buses. The optimal expansion solution is characterized by 124 buses (41 PV buses, 83 PQ buses) and 176 network elements (118 OHL, 58 transformers, autotransformers). The relative OBF value (Fig. 5) has been computed being the ratio between the current expansion solution OBF and the one corresponding to the maximum expansion solution. The OBF value permanently improves during the algorithm evolution. This fact is explained due to the power system scale and increased number of transmission network expansion candidates. For the 1st three computing steps 17.5% OBF decreasing value is recorded and additionally 1.2% for the following ones. The dynamic retrospective transmission network expansion planning results are synthesized in Table 2.

  They are several quasi-optimal solutions, having close OBF values. As an alternative solution, the 28037–28040, 28040–28082 400 kV OHL’s are replaced by d.c. 220 kV OHL’s.

  • Prospective approach The starting point is represented by the initial situation corresponding to the 2015 year. Expansion solutions for each future stage are computed step-by-step (2020, 2025, 2030, 2035 years). Results obtained for 2035 year are representing the ﬁnal solutions for the 20 years’ analyzed period. The admissible solutions’ domain has been considered to be the one deﬁned by the maximum expansion solution, excluding the network elements already introduced at each stage of the prospective dynamic expansion. The dynamic prospective transmission network expansion planning results are synthesized in Table 3. 6.4  
   
  Comments on the Expansion Solution  
   
  Comparing the results gathered from both approaches the following conclusions are highlighted: • 2020 year solution is different for the two approaches, but it has very close OBF value. For the prospective approach the 28057–28055 and 28087–28086 220 kV OHLs have been considered as double circuit, resulting 5 new network elements (instead of 3 in the retrospective one); • a similar comment is suitable for 2025 year solution – the total number of new network elements is 8 in the prospective approach (7 in the retrospective one). The difference refers to the 28016–28973 220 kV OHL which has been considered already as double circuit (in the retrospective solution only in 2030);

  • for 2030 year solution the total number of new network elements is 13 in the prospective approach (instead of 12 in the retrospective one). The difference refers to the 28087–28086 220 kV OHL which has been considered already as double circuit (in the retrospective solution in 2035); • the ﬁnal expansion solution is the same for the both approaches, the intermediary stages being slightly different.  
   
  7 Conclusions The developed software tools are able to be used in case of large scale, complex transmission networks. They behave as hybrid software tool, the PSO and GA techniques being used for the OPF and network expansion stages. PSO and GA have been adapted to the power engineering ﬁeld. The prospective and retrospective dynamic expansion approaches are providing identical solutions (for the last year). For both cases other expansion solutions, additional to the optimal one, have been proposed. This information is helping the network planner to adopt the best planning scenario. However, some difference may appear during the intermediary stages (years). In case of the prospective approach, there are situations when the process is started from an initial solution less or more different from the retrospective approach. But, the ﬁnal results are the same. There are also situations when the solutions for the 1st and ﬁnal expansion stage (year) are the same, but intermediary ones (2025, 2030 years) are different.

  Abstract. Time-triggering and distributed nature of the grid are emerging as the major challenge in managing energy in distribution grids. This investigation presents an event triggered distributed optimal power ﬂow (OPF) algorithm for energy grids. To generate the event triggers, we use the epidemic algorithm. The buses are classiﬁed into three: infected, susceptible, and dead. The network works in two modes: normal and optimization mode. In the normal mode, only event detection happens and when there are no event triggers, the system is said to be in normal mode. In optimization mode, event triggers that can be a change in generation or demand beyond a threshold value that necessitates the reoptimization of the network, the optimization mode begins. In this mode, the infected node which is infected by change in bus variable intimates it to the energy management application. The energy management application on sensing this change, will initiate the graph grammars which are a set of rules to change the bus nature by detecting the eﬀect of the change on the particular bus. The network is re-optimized using a DC OPF formulation as it is convex and can be solved using simple matrix inversion on the stationary conditions. As a result, the solution of DCOPF problem becomes that of solving a system of linear equations of the form Ax = b, which is solved using Krylov’s method or the Arnoldi algorithm in a distributed fashion. Each node solves the problem of its one-hop neighbours in parallel and this leads to a distributed implementation resulting signiﬁcant reduction in complexity. The propossed approach is illustrated on a simple 3 bus network. c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E. Balas et al.

  Introduction  
   
  In many energy management systems (EMS), time-triggering is used for optimization (see, [1–5] and references therein). This leads to unnecessary computations as the grid re-optimizes even without change in grid conditions. The complexity is compounded by the distributed nature of the grid. Considering the ﬂuctuating nature of the demand and generation, and their distribution within the grid, event-triggering is more suitable as thresholds of change are detected and re-optimization of the EMS application is initiated. Moreover, some of these changes can be localized using a distributed optimization algorithm. This significantly reduces the complexity. Therefore, energy management applications that are event triggered and perform distributed optimization are very much required in modern energy grids integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS) [6]. Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a widely used tool for energy management and planning. The OPF problem computes the optimal generator dispatches considering the network parameters to optimize either the cost, line-losses, demand response, and many other objectives (see, [7–12]). There are various solution methods for OPF such as quadratic programming [13], semi-deﬁnite programming [14], sequential quadratic programming [15], linear programming [16], and nonlinear programming [22,27] to name a few. These approaches use a static optimization approach and do not consider time-variations of the demand or ﬂuctuating generation and are hence not suitable for modern grids. Dynamic OPF overcomes this problem as it solves a problem considering time as a running parameter [17]. However, still the dynamic OPF cannot deal with ﬂuctuations in demand and generation. To overcome this receding

  horizon approach or model predictive control for OPF problem has been studied. In [22,28], the ACOPF problem using forecast on renewable generation and demand has been solved using the receding horizon approach. The major drawback with these approaches is the time-triggering. The grid is re-optimized even when there is no signiﬁcant changes in grid conditions or optimized only after a certain change has occurred which is not useful aspect of the EMS. A modiﬁed scenario could be to initiate the optimization whenever there are signiﬁcant changes in the grid variables such as demand or generation. This will reduce frequent optimization and computation overhead resulting thereof. More recently, distributed approaches for solving the OPF problem based on Gradient descent [19], decomposition methods [21], alternating directional method of multipliers [18], and others have been studied. In principle these methods consider two types of network models: ACOPF and DCOPF. While ACOPF provides a comprehensive study on both transient and steady state behaviour including the voltage magnitudes, they are non-convex and non-linear requiring signiﬁcant computations for optimizing the grid. On the other hand, in many scenarios DCOPF which are an approximation of ACOPF problem behave reasonably well and are widely used in practice [20]. The main advantage of DCOPF is that it leads to a convex problem and its solution is relatively simple and unique compared to ACOPF. Moreover, as just a matrix inversion on the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions or the stationary conditions of the DCOPF problem can provide the optimal power dispatches, they are widely preferred. This investigation addresses the two challenges discussed above timetriggering and distributed nature of the grid. It uses an event-triggered optimization and solves the DCOPF problem in a distributed manner. To generate the event triggers, it uses the epidemic programming widely studied for spreading information in distributed systems [23]. Then it solves the DCOPF problem in a distributed manner by formulating it as a set of linear equations and uses the Krylov’s method (i.e. Arnoldi’s algorithm) as the stationary conditions of the DCOPF problem lead to a positive deﬁnite matrix. The solution can be obtained fast using the Krylov’s method. The main contributions of the investigation are: • An epidemic algorithm based event triggering mechanism. • A self-assembly procedure using rules. • Distributed OPF implementation using Krylov’s method. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the problem formulation. The concept of autonomous gossiping is presented in Sect. 3. The Krylov’s method for performing distributed optimization is presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents a 3-bus case study.

  Problem Formulation  
   
  Consider the multi-period DCOPF problem widely studied in literature:   C (Pg ) t∈T pg ∈G  
   
  Pg  
   
  s.t.  
   
  (1) B.θt = Pt − Dt , Pgmin  
   
  ≤ Pg, t ≤  
   
  ∀t ∈ T  
   
  Pgmax  
   
  The line-ﬂow constraints and the ramp-up/down constraints of the generators are not considered in the formulation due to simplicity. One can verify that the variations can happen in the optimization problem only due to changes in real-power generations which may be due to renewable generation or changes in demand. The problem is usually solved periodically based using time as a reference parameter. However, performing time-triggered optimization requires the problem be solved repeatedly even when there is no update in the generation. This is generally not preferred. A more realistic scenario can be the event triggering i.e., on sensing there is a change in grid condition re-optimize the generator settings for reducing the operating cost. But again the problem has to be solved in a centralized fashion which increases the computation complexity. Signiﬁcant reduction can be obtained, if the problem is solved in a distributed fashion. Moreover, since the DCOPF problem is convex, the KKT conditions can provide the unique solution to the optimization problem. Further, the very nature of the network architecture i.e. the bus reactance from bus i to j, xij is equal to in magnitude to xji . Therefore, elements of the matrix that models the stationary conditions is symmetric. The problem is to study the design of a distributed DCOPF implementation that uses event triggering for optimizing the network operating cost. The formulation leads to the following pertinent questions: 1. How to generate the event triggers? 2. How to distribute the computation? 3. Can convergence and robustness of the distributed computation be guaranteed? The answers to the above questions will be considered in the rest of the paper.

  Autonomous Gossiping  
   
  Autonomous gossiping algorithms such as the epidemic algorithms are emerging as a method for propagating information in distributed systems [24]. They have been applied to wide class of problems like replication of database systems [25], wireless sensor routing, and more recently also in electric networks [26]. They

  are seen as a robust and scalable means to disseminate information reliably on a distributed network the same way an epidemic will propagate through a set of individuals. The use of gossip-like distributed optimization algorithm for reactive power ﬂow control was investigated by Bolognani and Zampieri in [26]. The investigation considered its use in the reactive power ﬂow control problem of the microgrid. This investigation considers the use of the autonomous gossip algorithms for distributed optimal power ﬂow (DOPF). Each bus is considered one agent in the algorithm. The agents with the generators have a cost function that models the generation cost that is quadratic. Hence, for each generation node, the cost is given by C(PG g) = ag × (PGg )2 + bg × (PGg ) + cg  
   
  ∀g ∈ G  
   
  where ag , bg and cg are constants provided by the GenCo. We assume that an event occurs whenever there is a change in the generator or demand settings and the general optimization problem is less sensitive to changes below the threshold i in each agent. The threshold value can be determined from sensitivity analysis or by simple numerical iterations. In some instances, the values can be updated online as well. The algorithm works in two modes: normal and optimization. We assume that the optimal generator settings for the normal mode are obtained using a distributed OPF formulation and that the grid is functioning within thresholds. The normal mode monitors for the threshold  being breached in some node and sends triggers for re-optimization. As soon as the triggers are received, the algorithm enters the optimization mode, wherein the nodes are classiﬁed into three categories: infected, susceptible, and dead. The infected node is the one that has exceeded the threshold, whereas the susceptible can contract the infection, and the dead-node is not aﬀected directly by the infected node, or is not aﬀected at all. Three types of actions are deﬁned: push, pull, and push-pull. In the push action, the infected node tries to send information to its one-hop neighbours regarding the event. The susceptible nodes try to pull the information from the infected node on the magnitude of the violation. Then they inform the dead node of the violation and also pull an information from them about their current status. In order to promote autonomous gossiping, we deﬁne the rules in Table 1. The above table is used to create autonomous organization of the agents and they form a self-assembly. The agents status gets changed during each iteration of the algorithm until the threshold reaches below i in all the infected buses. The algorithm starts with the infected node pushing its information to its onehop neighbours during the ﬁrst iteration. The susceptible nodes receive this information and start re-optimizing triggers to their peers. The common variable is the load angle θi that models the diﬀerence between the load balance and also the line-limits. On sensing a variation in theta from the optimal value, the network is broken at the very node that experiences it, and various zones are formed. The coupling

  65  
   
  between the diﬀerent zones is the variable θi that is replicated. The self-assembly step will be used to send event trigger and the algorithm continues its execution until the convergence to optimal value. Table 1. Self-organizing rules for the nodes in DOPF

  The above conditions lead to a set of linear equations in the unknowns X = [Pg , θ, λ]. The problem can hence be represented as: M ×X =b  
   
  (8)  
   
  The above solution has 3 × n linear equations that need to be solved in a distributed fashion. The objective of this investigation is to have a distributed approach, which means the computation above has to be distributed between the diﬀerent nodes. To form the distributed updates, the infected and its one hop neighbours are considered, a reduced order linear equations of the one-hop neighbours is solved using the Krylov’s method. The idea is to construct a reduced space Km with a dimension m 0 are weighing matrices of appropriate dimensions, and QN ≥ 0 is the terminal weighing matrix. Proof: Deﬁne the cost-to-go function at time k as, Jk (xk ) =

  χ=k  
   
  + (xN − rN )T QN (xN − rN ) subject to relations (Eq.(5))  
   
  (12)  
   
  Note that Jk (xk ) gives the minimum cost-to-go starting from the state xk at time instant k. As Jk (xk ) is quadratic, the cost-to-go has the form (Eq. (13)) Jk (xk ) = xTk Pk xk + 2qk xk + rkT Qrk  
   
  (13)  
   
  where qk = −QT rk , and Pk = PkT ≥ 0 that can be found recursively using backward iteration algorithm by taking PN = QN .  
   
  86  
   
  S. Srinivasan et al.  
   
  Assuming that Jk+1 has the given form, from dynamic programming principle, suppose we know Jk+1 (xk+1 ) and look for optimal input uk the Bellman equation is given by (Eq. (14)) Jk (xk ) = min(xk − rk )T Q(xk − rk ) + uTk Ruk u  
   
  + Jk+1 (φxk + Γ0 uk + Γ1 uk−1 ) = (xk − rk )T Q(xk − rk ) + min(uTk R uk + (φxk + Γ0 uk + Γ1 uk−1 )T

  Pk+1 (φxk + Γ0 uk + Γ1 uk−1 ) T (φxk + Γ0 uk + Γ1 uk−1 ) + 2qk+1  
   
  From the necessary conditions of optimality, we obtain Ruk + Γ0T Pk+1 [φxk + Γ0 uk + Γ1 uk−1 ] + Γ0T qk+1 = 0  
   
  (15)  
   
  Little manipulation of Eq. (15) leads to Eq. (9) with the adaptive gains given by Eq. (10).  Obviously, the computation of adaptive controller gains requires the knowledge of Pk+1 and the estimate of time-delay τk to compute Γ0 (τk ) and Γ1 (τk ). We compute Pk+1 recursively working backward from k = N by letting PN = QN , where QN is the terminal weighing matrix. The estimate of τk is obtained as described in Sect. 3. The Gains are computed from Eq. (10). Having obtained the results required for computing the gains, we now proceed to illustrate the controller by combining experiments with simulation.

  Results and Discussions  
   
  This section presents the results obtained from experiments and simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed adaptive controller. 5.1  
   
  Delay Estimation from Experiments  
   
  To estimate the time-varying delays, experimentation was conducted on Modbus over TCP/IP by connecting several controllers, and then loading the network (by increasing the number of inputs/outputs and number of rungs in PLC ladder diagram). Further, the length of the communication channel was varied by connecting controllers such as ABB AC 500 at diﬀerent locations. The prototype of the experiment is shown in Fig. 5 wherein there is a Master controller (also called the Modbus Master), and Slave controllers. The delays for variations of the parameters during experimentation is recorded both for training and validation phases of MRAN. During the network training phase the weights were adjusted to match the samples, whereas in the validation phase the delay estimates were compared with the estimates

  generated by MRAN. The ﬁrst 400 samples of delay data were used in learning, and the next 100 samples of data were used in validation of the estimates. After validation, in the test phase MRAN can be used to generate the delay estimates for designing the adaptive controller on-line. The number of hidden neurons in MRAN, delay samples from the network, estimated delays, and the error (diﬀerence between the actual and estimated network delay) are shown in Fig. 6. It was found that MRAN can estimate the delay with a maximum error of 2.2 ms, and an average error of less than 1 ms over 10 samples. 30

  To illustrate MRAN-based adaptive controller, we consider the scalar example x(t) ˙ = 2x(t) + u(t)  
   
  (16)  
   
  with rk = 1 and initial condition x0 = 2 as in [12]. The poor performance of the static state feedback controller for this example has been illustrated by the authors of [14]. Our investigation uses a sampling time of 10 ms, and the estimated delay varies from 4 ms to 10 ms. Figures 7 and 8 show the response along with the control input uk with delays being changed at t = 25 s and delay varying at every 10 s using delay estimates from MRAN, respectively. This result illustrates that MRAN based controller adapts the gain to track the controller input even in the case of fast variations in delay. 5.3

  The sampled-data representation of linear NCSs with total delay (at each sampling instant k) less than the sampling time, i.e. τk ≤ h, can be obtained using MATLAB routine NCSd developed by the authors of the paper, see [33]. Figure 9 shows the response of the system (Eq. 18) under the MRAN-based adaptive controller ((Eq. 5) using the constant reference signal rk = [0 0]T for each k. The Figure additionally shows the control values uk and the delay estimates from MRAN. The result shows the regulatory performance of the controller in the presence of delays. Variations in the gains Lx , Lr , and Lu with time-varying delays τk are shown in Fig. 10. The gains are adjusted according to channel delays τk to track the reference state, and these variations are reﬂected mostly in the gain Lu . The states of the double integrator system in Eq. (18) with the adaptive controller (Eq. (5)) and desired states rk = [1 0]T are shown in Fig. 11. This response illustrates the tracking performance of the adaptive controller. Variations in gain Lx , Lr , and Lu with time-varying delays τk are shown in Fig. 12.

  Conclusion  
   
  In this investigation time varying delays in communication channels were modeled using MRAN, based on experiments conducted with Modbus over TCP/IP network. Information on network conditions such as loading, communication length, contention ratio, and number of connected nodes along with experimental delays was used to train the MRAN. Once trained using network conditions, MRAN generates delay estimates that were used to design adaptive controller for NCSs subjected to time-varying delays. MRAN-based estimation yields a learning based framework for estimating delays and, therefore, is more suitable for real-time control. The adaptive controller uses LQR approach to compute the gains and as a result, optimality is guaranteed by construction. Then, conditions for stability of the proposed controller were derived. The results were illustrated using two simple simulation examples along with delay estimates from MRAN. Results indicate that the adaptive controller modiﬁes its gain based on time-varying delays in communication channels to meet the performance requirements. Adaptive controller by addressing packet-loss and implementing the adaptive control in real-time industrial pilot are the future prospects of this investigation. Acknowledgments.

  Aspects Regarding Risk Assessment of Human Body Exposure in Electric and Magnetic Fields Marius Lolea and Simona Dzitac(&) Department of Energy Engineering, University of Oradea, Oradea, Romania [email protected]  , [email protected]  Abstract. The paper gives an idea of attaching the risk of electromagnetic ﬁeld exposure in the general population and employees with potential health hazards that are related to the different sensitivity of the human body. The difference between the two categories of people, is that in the ﬁrst case, the intersection with the devices which generating electromagnetic ﬁeld is optional both in duration, number or distance, and in the second case this option is canceled due to duties of services that give the obligation of employees to stationed in areas with such types of devices. Even if there are thresholds exposure limit values for electric and magnetic ﬁeld quantities considered hazardous to health, referred to in legal settlements can not say with certainty that human sensitivity and is given the same thresholds for different age and sex categories. These ﬁt rather with probability theory. Therefore the work is appreciated and that the risk to health or human behaviors generated by electromagnetic ﬁeld exposure related to probability theory and treatment of this risk is therefore using a probabilistic model.  
   
  1 Introduction The multiple types of speciﬁc diseases of modern civilization and the large number of reported cases led to the idea of search for new cause increased risk of their generation. Among the causes were included and electromagnetic ﬁeld exposure. Fears are ampliﬁed by the existence of numerous electromagnetic devices that help to increase life comfort and technical progress. Epidemiological and laboratory studies, conducted at worldwide lavel have highlighted several problems attributed ﬁeld with different degrees of certainty. The results of these studies are controversial [5, 9, 11]. However, national rules limiting the exposure of persons, the maximum limit values are provided for parameters such as electric and magnetic ﬁeld and the exposure so that the effects are not harmful to health [6, 7]. The interplay between electromagnetic ﬁelds and living matter are very different and depend on the frequency of electromagnetic waves, the amplitude of characteristic parameters of the ﬁeld and proportion of energy transmitted to the body [5, 9–12]. Biological implications of exposure to magnetic ﬁelds against human body, is can study methodological with a cybernetic or an analytical method [5]. Cybernetic method consider the biological system as a black box characterized input quantities, output sizes and connections between them. Input values are given by electromagnetic ﬁeld parameters. Output sizes are effects on the living organism. Connections between the sizes of input and output are formed from interaction mechanisms which are obtained on experimental basis. The analytical method is based © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  on mathematical modeling of biological systems. The phenomena that occur at the molecular level to the application of an electromagnetic ﬁeld are: electronic excitation, the polarization, the appearance of electrical forces, thermal effects, dipolar interactions, etc. Exist, circuit diagrams of the living cell developed and mathematical models to study the electromagnetic interaction at anatomic level [5]. In a few situations electromagnetic ﬁeld impact with human body it is a risk factor occupational diseases [4]. The purpose of the paper is to assess the level of human exposure through measurements values for the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by electrical power networks equipments and risk of exceeding normal levels considered dangerous of these sizes. For this second case apply a probabilistic model [1–3].  
   
  2 Probabilistic Methods from Risks Assessment The risk associated with occurrence of a certain event comes down, in the simplest form, as the product of the probability of that event and the consequences of that event. For example, for a given level of risk desired, as the likelihood of an event decreases the potential consequences products may increase. All the events (states), through which a physical system during the experience is called ﬁeld events. By associating a ﬁeld event of an experiment may be obtained depth information on knowledge of the phenomenon studied [1, 3]. The probability transferred in quantitative and intuitive plan of numbers, a concrete situation pattern of events, allows some comparison of events. In this way, the probability is a measure of risk. The concepts of probability and probability ﬁnite ﬁeld can be presented as axiomatic form. By Kolmogorov, probability is deﬁned by the following axioms: • each event A 2 K, of the ﬁeld events K, is associated with a positive number P {A}, called the probability of the event; • P {E} = 1 is the probability of the event is safe and has a maximum value; • if two events A, B 2 K, are incompatible, then: {P} = P A [ B {A} + P {B}. The concepts of probability of appearance p, and non-appearance probability r of an event for which p + r = 1, allow to judge between safety and risk that there is a complementary relationship. On the basis of the axioms of Kolmogorov, it follows that R(p) + S(r) = 1, where R(p) is the probability of risk corresponding to an event, and S(r) - additional safety risk. The relation: R(p) + S(r) = 1 reveal that an increased risk involving a decrease of safety and a risk reduction involve an increases of the safety, the two sizes having values in the range [0, 1]. In the general case it can write: 0 < R(p) < 1 sau 0 < S(r) < 1, after which, in particular: If R(p) ! o, it can write S(r) ! 1 and inverse. If danger determines the risk, then the risk can be deﬁned as a measure of danger P (p) and its extent permitted limit value: R(p) = limn!1 PðnÞ ¼ P(p)

  For the particular case of the action of the electromagnetic ﬁeld on the human body either by direct coupling or by electromagnetic radiation, the danger is delimited by limit values standardized of ﬁeld quantities considered harmful. Thus, assessing the probability of exceeding the normal levels that are considered generating negative health effects, is a step in assessing risk from exposure. The risk here can be deﬁned as the product of probability of exceeding the exposure limit values for E and B and that the consequences of these exceedances, the latter being far damage human life or health. Following graphs below of normal distributions, we can estimate the risk from producing an unwanted event by leaving the chosen interval of signiﬁcance [8] (Fig. 1).

  For a bilateral risk, where: 1 − a is the level of signiﬁcance; ha − hb = interval of signiﬁcance; a – the risk. Assessed risk the consequences of exposure to electromagnetic ﬁeld is generated type as unilateral effects considered dangerous to humans is only upside quantities of electric and magnetic ﬁeld above their normal intake. A typical case of bilateral risk is generated by electromagnetic disturbances such as voltage fluctuations. Whether the voltage drops below a certain threshold, as in dips or rises above the maximum value that this service became Surge, risks in product supply electricity to consumers are double effect.

  3 Risk Assessment Generated to Humans Exposured in Electromagnetic Field Generated by Power Grids Assessing the risk of exceeding the permissible values for magnetic induction (B) and electric ﬁeld (E) is performed by comparing the density function of considered size distribution (f(B) and/or (E)) with the permissible limit value of these sizes set of regulations in the ﬁeld of workers’ exposure to electromagnetic ﬁelds and/or the general population [2, 3]. For calculations follow the next steps: (a) shall be taken from measurements the values of magnetic induction B and electric ﬁeld strength E at various locations; (b) is calculated for each location, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the values taken at the measuring points; (c) Considering that values have a normal distribution, determine the probability density function expression (f(B)/f(E)). The form of this function is [3]: 1 Mm 2 1 f(M) = pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ  e  2 ð r Þ 2p  r  
   
  ð3Þ  
   
  where: m – the mean of measured values; r – standard deviation of measured values; M = ﬁeld sizes considered: {E, B}.

Through the activities undertaken and functional characteristics of the electricity networks they serve workers are exposed to electromagnetic ﬁelds generated by them. The electromagnetic environment is formed due to the operation of all sources of a given site or a particular territory. Therefore for each location we need to consider

  all sources of electromagnetic ﬁeld. Measuring devices used were: CA 42 Field meter and SPECTRAN 5035, both equipped with internal probes of magnetic ﬁeld and external for electric ﬁeld. Displaying values is in V/m for E and in lT for B. Measuring step is noted by dm and is chosen as equal to 2 m, to detect with high accuracy, the maximum values of quantities of electric and magnetic ﬁeld. With measured values will be calculated the averages, standard deviations and risk probability [1–3]. For the general population analyzes a portion of a high voltage overhead power lines (PL), which crosses the city of Oradea through a crowded area. In the case of power lines(PL) measurements have been performed under conductors, in line axis. Technical characteristics of the PL for the aperture considered, are: circuit type d.c., Un = 110 kV, connection between substations Oradea Sud – Oradea Vest, the portion of Auchan supermarket, on Radu Enescu street, type poles: STC, aperture lenght = 126 m, composite insulators, conductors type: OL-Al 185/32 mm2, gauges: cond.1 = 13.7 m, cond.2 = 13.4 m, cond.3 = 14.05 m, cond.4 = 13.17 m, cond.5 = 14.25 m, cond.6 = 13.76 m; number of measurements: 126/2 = 63 at measure step considered. On the HPP Tileagd case, is exempliﬁed with the values of magnetic induction B, taken around of the generators excitation, where operational staff have access, expressed in lT. In the case of generators the measurements were carried out on a circular path around them. Threshold values within normal limits, are [6, 7]: Elim = 5000 V/m for the general population, Elim = 10000 V/m for employees; Blim = 100 lT for the general population; Blim = 500 lT for employees. Allowable limit values were periodically adjusted by their decreasing, due to the fact that research into exposure domain have been perfected over time. Therefore, to consider the Gaussian variations of their, is appropriate. With considered ﬁxed limit values, Fig. 2 shows the risk graph for the aperture analyzed and in Fig. 3 shows the risk graph for operators from generators hall of HPP Tileagd, belonging to Bihor Power System.

  To generate common area beneath the two curves, the left and right of the point of intersection called risk area, perform the necessary settings in Mathcad. These are indicated in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4 is shown in green color, the resulting risk in case the two standard deviations are equal. In case of the measured magnetic flux density values exempliﬁed for synchronous generators hall of o HPP Tileagd, they were chosen radial directions for further circular and concentric routes around excitation systems. Since the operators do not have to stand throughout the service duration near excitation systems, the acceptable value exposure to magnetic induction is considered the value of Blim = 100 lT.

  4 Conclusions In the context of scientiﬁc uncertainty regarding the effects of exposure to electromagnetic ﬁelds advisable to adopt the precautionary approach by implementing administrative measures, inform and train the population, especially those at risk of exposure sources and not least support from decision makers, on the development of an adequate logistics structure from monitoring electromagnetic ﬁelds and their effects in the long term. The calculation model which is adopted, not give information about risk consequences but, based on the distribution of the measured values enable the assessment of the likelihood of exceeding the normal threshold for electric ﬁeld intensity electric and magnetic ﬁeld induction on exposure to electromagnetic ﬁeld of workers from the power system or the general population. Exposure Risk assessment is done by comparing the results of calculation of probability values exceeded the normal values of ﬁeld sizes for all staff categories analyzed. Standard deviations and default the dispersions of measured values, are more pronounced where the measuring points were distributed over large areas with a great variety of equipment and devices that work with large differences between voltages and currents service. However, if one considers that there are sensitivities and different reactions bodies in terms of exposure to electromagnetic ﬁeld as suggested in the literature, along with the assumption accepted the job as the limit values allowable quantities Field pursue distribution normal, then the risk of negative effects on the human body increases. This is evident because the overlap of the two distributions is more pronounced in the lower levels of the two categories of values, measured and admissible. Then probabilistic model adopted is justiﬁed especially if it is found that the values of magnetic induction and electric ﬁeld strength, results of measurements, follow a normal distribution.

  Abstract. Smart Grid provides a ﬂexible and powerful framework to integrate Distributed Energy Resources (DER). DER consisting of energy sources (such as renewable, conventional, storage) and loads. Based on application, there can be diﬀerent modes of operating. It can operate in parallel with, or independently from, the main grid. Because of social, economic, and environmental beneﬁts, the demands of DER system is increasing gradually. Combination of DERs and Loads with control units forms a miniature grid which is known as Microgrid. Integrating of DERs to the Microgrid system has two aspects: electrical and communication. Electrical integration has their own challenges which are addressed in IEEE 1547 standard. However, challenges related to communication and information integration of multi vendor DERs system is still open. Currently, IEC 61850-7-420 is the only standard which deﬁnes information model for DERs, but it is not completely accepted by DER manufacturers. On the other side, IEC 61850 mapped communication protocols like MMS, GOSSE, DNP3 etc. are substation protocols and may not suitable to fulﬁll DERs to DERs communication demands. In this paper, we provide an overview of Smart Grid conceptual framework and highlight DER scope. We discuss DER system components, various applications and required communication features. We review IEC 61850 mapped communication protocol MMS and identify the limitation for using in DERs communication.

  Introduction  
   
  The traditional electrical grid is an interconnected network for delivering electricity from suppliers to consumers. It consists of generating stations that produces electrical power, high-voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand centers, and distribution lines that connect individual customers. The growing demand of electricity led to increase numbers of electrical c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E. Balas et al.

  grids deployment located at diﬀerent geographical location. The electrical grid is a broadcast grid networks, where a few central power generator provides all the electricity production to the industrial and residential customer via a large network of cables and transformers. Electrical grid structure can summarized as follows: one-way energy ﬂow from central station generators, over a transmission network, through substations onto distribution systems, over radial distribution circuits to end-use customers. To address the increasing energy demands, the traditional electrical grids being enhanced by adding more bulk generators to produce more energy. Bulk generators mostly use fossils fuels for power generation. On this earth, there are limited fossils fuels. Rapid consumption of limited natural resources must be avoided for future sustainable energy generation. To meet the future demands of electricity it is being focused to shift traditional grid generating power from fossils fuels to renewable resources [1]. The renewable resources are solar, wind, small hydro, tidal, biogas etc. The future of electric grid is Smart Grid (SG) [1]. The objective of SG is to improve energy eﬃciency and reduce carbon footprint at all the stages of energy ﬂow: Bulk Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Consumption. SG vision is to provide an open framework and protocol for information and power exchange seamlessly. Unlike traditional electric grid, which is centralized grid, the SG is decentralized grid. It allows to integrate power sources at distribution level. The end consumer can be Prosumers, which acts as electricity consumer and producers at the same time. Prosumer have their own small Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) for electricity generation. Based on local usage, the additional generated power can be supply to utility grid. Presently, most of the prosumers have limitation, they can not supply surplus power to utility grid because of insuﬃcient electrical and communication infrastructure [2]. The surplus overproduced electricity is just thrown away, if prosumer’s energy storage are full. Lack of infrastructure support causes waste of energy. The beneﬁts of the DER integration in smart grids has been discussed in [12–15]. Because of social, economical and environment beneﬁts, DER technology is evolving, new DER systems are getting deployed across the globe. However, research are still lacking for providing standard communication interface for DERs [3] system. Real time information exchange is very crucial to ensure reliable power supply. Presently, most of the DER system communicates with other system either on proprietary protocols or basic protocols like Modbus. There is no standard communication protocol and interface are recommended for DER system by International Standard organization. DER system is considered as an alternative of main power grid. New applications are developed to connect with DER system to enable new features. Lack of standard interfaces and protocols limitation to provide interoperable among diﬀerent manufacture devices and system. International standard IEC 61850 [4] is known and worldwide accepted standard for Substation Automation. It decouples the application data model from communication protocols and provide ﬂexibility for extending this standard for any application. Because of this ﬂexibility, addition of new domain is always

  possible with IEC 61850. It is also being consider as a prime mover of SG framework. Since, it brings ﬂexible and open framework for monitor, control, and measurement applications. The IEC 61850 7-420 [5] standard deﬁnes information model for DER, that describe what information and semantics to exchange with other DER system. DER communication with existing IEC 61850 mapped protocols such as MMS, DNP3, GOOSE can be implemented. However, from DER functionality point of view, many of the communication needs may not be fulﬁlled by these protocols. For example, auto device registration and plug and play, session less communication among DERs, etc. Authors in [11] investigated the role of OPC UA and IEC 61850 integration for enabling smart grids and demonstrated how OPC UA can provide communication medium for smart grid elements. Interoperability is the key aspects DER system. One DER system must be interoperable with other DER system. Interoperability is an ability of two systems to communicate and share information with each other. The communication aspect of devices can be divided into four aspects [5]: Information modeling (the type of data to be exchanged-nouns), Service modeling (the read, write, or other actions to take on data-verbs), Communication protocols (mapping the noun and verb models to actual bits and bytes), and telecommunication media (ﬁber optics, radio system, wire, and other equipment). Currently, IEC 618507-420 is the only standard which deﬁnes information model and data model for DER system. However, the existing IEC 61850 mapped protocol seems not to be suitable for DERs communication. Most of the DER system vendors does not support IEC 61850 communication protocols in the DER system. They use their proprietary for simplicity and ease of development. Manufacturers of DER system would like to continue DER communication with their proprietary protocols. As we mentioned earlier, IEC 61850 standard is designed for Substation Automation, where system conﬁgurations is static and preconﬁgured. Therefore, existing IEC 61850 protocols may not be suitable for DER system communication. Yoo et al. [6] has shown IEC 61850 communication architecture based Microgrid communication and only considered static DER system conﬁguration. Suˇci´c et al. [7] highlighted the IEC 61850 communication protocol limitations for DER system and suggested Service Oriented Architecture for DER system. In this paper, we discuss an overview of Smart Grid and DER. Further, we discuss diﬀerent applications of DER system and provide the required communication viewpoints. The rest of the paper is organize as follows. Section 2 provide an brief overview of Smart Grid Architectural Model Framework and discuss diﬀerent domains and zones. In Sect. 3, we discuss the Distributed Energy Resources system, its application, and communication architecture. Section 4, we have evaluated IEC 61850 communication protocols for DER communication. Section 4 discuss challenges for implementing IEC 61850 communication protocols in DER system. And, in Sect. 5 conclude the whole paper.

  Smart Grid Conceptual Framework  
   
  Smart Grid (SG) is a combination of diﬀerent technologies and can be seen as complex system. The key enabler of SG framework is an open communication and integration framework, which allows bidirectional information and electricity ﬂow. Figure 1 shows a conceptual Smart Grid Architecture Model(SGAM) proposed by National Institute of Standard and Technology [1].  
   
  Fig. 1. SGAM conceptual framework model [1]  
   
  SGAM framework consists of Business layer, Function layer, Information layer, Communication layer, and Component layer. An interoperability aspect must be satisﬁed among the layer for successful Smart Grid operation. The Smart Grid system is divided into two aspects Electrical process and Information management. In the SGAM framework, domains represent electrical process and Zones represent the information management. Domains physically related to the electrical grid components: Bulk Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), and Customer premises. It is arranged according to the electrical energy conversion ﬂow. Zones are related to power system management. Zone reﬂects the hierarchical level based on aggregation and functions separation of each hierarchical level. DER is considered as basic building block for Smart Grid system. Since, it provides ancillary distributed energy resources at distribution level, close of end consumers. The importance of DER are being recognized due to its social, economic, and environmental beneﬁts. Growing number of DER demand is estimated to reach USD 34.94 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 10.9% between 2016 and 2022 [8].

  DER plan is consisting of diﬀerent energy sources (e.g. renewable, conventional, storage) and loads. It is capable of operating in parallel with, or independently from, the main grid. DER system is more than back-up power source. Figure 2 shows an example of DER system.

  DER plant operates in two modes: Grid Connected (grid mode) and Grid Isolated (islanding mode). In the grid mode, DER plan is connected to utility grid Common Coupling Point (CCP). It is being controlled based on utility grid power supply and cost factor behavior. For example, if DER is generating energy using renewable sources, then the load will use energy from and optimize the utility grid power in order to save overall cost. While in the case of islanding mode, DER is not connected to utility grid. It acts to remote power sources. Load is completely relied on DER. Based on the condition the transition takes place between, grid to islanding mode, and islanding to grid mode. The fundamental operational requirements of DER plant to provide stability of frequency and voltage for ensuring optimal power ﬂow to the load. Grid to islanding mode requires transition and stabilization for minimal load shedding and distribution. Islanding to grid mode requires resynchronization and minimum impact for sensitive loads during transient periods. Each of these operations are highly dependent on underlying communication infrastructure. The growing demand of DER system increased the complexity of multivendor DER elements interconnection, since most of the DER plant vendors use their own proprietary communication protocols.

  Typically, DER plant may have three level of controller. Primary, secondary and tertiary controller [9]. Primary controller is machine’s (such as diesel generator) local controller. The secondary controller monitors and controls the primary controller based on the real time to operate and control generating machine behavior. Tertiary controller is used to controller power ﬂow among DER systems located at diﬀerent location. In the below subsection DER applications example are discussed to explain DER operating modes. 3.1  
   
  DER Applications  
   
  DER provides an alternative local power source in parallel or independently from main grid. DER system can be simple or complex as per the application needs and use case. The following are the application scenarios of DER application. 3.1.1 Back up for Poor Power Quality of Main Grid Poor power quality refers inability of main grid to provide stable power supply with any ﬂuctuations. Power quality of grid strongly depends on the load characteristic and transmission and distribution grid infrastructure. Long transmission line with asymmetric loads can easily inﬂuence power quality, which can results into unbalanced voltage, harmonic, in power supply. Poor power quality may lead to power outage, if demands lead to power generation capacity. In such cases, DER system at the consumer site plays an important role. Depending on the ﬁeld of application, military, industrial, commercial, or residential, power quality requirement of diﬀerent DER system can be deployed to provide back up when there is poor power quality supply from main grid. 3.1.2 Natural Disasters Natural disasters such as earthquake, tornados, hurricanes, and tsunamis may damage power grid transmission and distribution network and the area which are not directly aﬀected by natural disasters may suﬀers from power outage for a week to months if damage is severe. Since DER system is not dependent on power supply of the power grid, the immediate construction of DER system can provide an alternate power supply. 3.1.3 Power Grid Failure Large power grid, chances of disturbances due to cyber-attack, terrorist attack, human error, natural incidents, etc. are very high. The cascading eﬀect of one unit failure can end up power outage in larger region. A grid isolated DER systems can be an alternative of Power grid failure in order to maintain power supply for crucial domains. 3.1.4 Addressing of Growing Power Demand The growing power demand results in unstable power supply if generation capacity lags the power demand. Upgrading of power grid generation is not an easy

  process it requires huge investment and eﬀort. Alternately, DER system is good candidate for satisfying growing demand of energy by deploying DERs near the high power demand zone. 3.1.5 Continuous Power Supply DER is the primary source of electricity and provides power supply to the load round the clock. 3.1.6 Uninterrupted Power Supply For this application, the crucial task of DER is very short start-up and ramp time to meet load demands. DER system should be stable and eﬃcient. Typically, the operating hours of such DER system is less than two hours. 3.2  
   
  Der Communication Architecture  
   
  From the communication point of view, DER system can be divided into three layers. Layer 1 - Machine/Primary controller to Secondary controller communication, Layer 2, Secondary controller to Central supervisory control, and Layer 3, central supervisory controller to other DER systems. These three layers are depicted in Fig. 3. Every generation unit such as PV array, wind turbine, diesel generator has its own primary controller unit, which locally controls the generator unit. Primary controller can start, stop and regulate the power generation. Primary controller interacts with secondary controller mostly using serial to analog interface. The job of secondary control is very crucial; it monitors the status of generator units and controls the physical aspects of generator based on vital statistics such voltage, frequency, circuitry health, etc. and broadcast the status information horizontally to other Secondary controller and vertically to Central Supervisory

  Control system. Communication between primary and secondary controller has highest frequency of message. High frequency of message of message is necessary for capturing and address transient behavior of the generators such as wind turbine, diesel generator etc. The message update cycle between primary controller and secondary controller is 10 ms, Secondary controller to secondary controller is 50 ms, Secondary controller to central supervisory controller is 100 ms, and, DER system to another DER system is more than 1 s. DER system will have advance features for ensuring autonomous operations. Some of these advance features are given below. 3.2.1 Automatic Discovery of DER System This feature allows DER system to discover new DER system in the network and synchronize their activities automatically. For example, if new wind turbine is connected to network, the existing DER system should be able to discover without having any prior inform of DER. 3.2.2 Dynamic System Configuration This feature allows DER system element to reconﬁgure themselves automatically based on the overall plant status in order to provide reliable, eﬃcient and good quality of power supply. 3.2.3 Plug and Play This feature allow new DER element to be part of network automatically. DER system will be conﬁgured automatically by Central Supervisory Control system. 3.2.4 Semantic Data Interpretation It is expected that dataset of DER system should be semantically interpreted by other DER system. This can be achieved if all the DER system support IEC 61850-7-420 information model.

  Analysis of IEC 61850 Communication Protocols for DER System  
   
  The IEC 61850 standard is specially designed for Substation Automation domain. The communication model is designed in way the application speciﬁc data exchange is independent from communication model. Therefore, IEC 61850 can be extended to other domains as well. IEC61850 standard allows the integration of all protection, control, measurement and monitoring functions by one common protocol. It provides the means of high-speed substation applications, station wide interlocking and other functions which needs intercommunication between IEDs. The advantage of using IEC 61850 standard is that it ensures the interoperability and information interchangeability among multivendor devices. Device from any vendor compliant to IEC 61850 standard can communicates

Figure 4 shows the IEC 61850 based communication between two applications. Disturbance recordings are sent using File Transfer model. A common formal description code, which allows a standardized representation of a systems data model and its links to communication services is presented by the standard and its called as SCL (Substation Conﬁguration Language) [10]. It covers all communication aspects according to IEC 61850. Based on XML schema, this code is an ideal electronic interchange format for conﬁguration data, an equivalent of EDDL in Process Automation applications. The data model and the communication services (deﬁned through ACSI) are decoupled from speciﬁc communication technology. This technology independence guarantees long term stability for the standard and opens up possibility to switch over to future communication technologies. Table 1 shows our analysis of IEC 61850 mapped MMS communication protocol for DER communication. We found MMS protocol may not be suitable for DER communication.

  Abstract. This investigation proposes a CPES architecture and model for engineering energy management application for smart grids. In particular, the investigation considers the implementation of the power systems state estimator (PSSE). The CPES architecture has three layers: physical, monitoring and applications. The physical layer consists of the grid and the various components. Since, the grid is usually engineered with various devices from multiple vendors that have different protocols and standards; data aggregation becomes a problem. The second layer of the CPES architecture overcomes this problem by proposing a middleware that aggregates data from the physical layer. The topmost layer is the applications layer, where the energy management system applications are implemented. These applications require the model, topology and information from the grid. This requires combining the physical aspects of the grid with the cyber ones. This investigation uses the common information model to model the grid and information exchanges. Then the model is combined with measurement and optimization models of the application to realize the PSSE. The proposed approach is illustrated on a Norwegian distribution grid in Steinkjer. Our results show that the CPES approach provides an easier way to engineer future smart grid applications.

With the advent of smart grids there is an unprecedented volume of data available that needs to be harmonized with the energy © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  flow. Consequently, communication and energy infrastructure have to be designed together for achieving cost beneﬁts from smart grids. The communication infrastructure includes middleware, communication networks, data-models, and software platforms. Furthermore, since smart grids are massively distributed systems scalability plays a vital role within various applications such as state estimation, stability analysis and contingency analysis. These applications rely on measurements from heterogeneous sensors that are manufactured by various vendors. Engineering such applications requires a framework for handling both the cyber and physical parts of the grid simultaneously. Cyber Physical Energy Systems (CPES) Approach is touted as a futuristic approach for engineering smart grids. They consider the tight coupling between the physical and cyber domains in their design. CPES is a recent research topic that has attracted signiﬁcant attention [1]. Palensky et al. [2] proposed to study the modern energy systems using the CPES approach with the following categories: physical models, information technology, roles and individual behavior, and aggregated as well as stochastic models. Furthermore, proposed the use of CPES approach as a tool and method for the emerging complexities of the energy grids. While, specialized and useful tools for individual domains of the energy systems exist, there is no methodology to combine the different aspects of the energy and information. Motivated by this CPES approach has been studied for modelling and enabling various aspects of the energy grids. To our best knowledge, Ilic et al. [3] ﬁrst proposed a dynamic model using the CPES approach. The proposed model greatly dependent on the cyber technologies supporting the physical system. Major contributors to the CPES modelling and design are Widl et al. [4–7]. In [4], the author studied the role of the continuous time and discrete-event CPES models for control applications such as demand response, load balancing, and energy storage management. The investigation [7] presented a co-simulation platform for components, controls, and power systems based on software applications such as (GridLAB-D, OpenModelica, PSAT, 4DIAC) for smart charging of electric vehicles. The use of CPES approach for energy optimization in buildings has been studied in [8–10]. The use of model based design methodology for validating control algorithms in a residential microgrid has been studied in [11]. The role of CPES system for electric charging applications has been studied in [12]. Similarly, reducing energy consumption by combining CPES and industry 4.0 was proposed in [13]. More recently, McCalley et al. [14, 15] surveyed the design techniques and applications of CPES. In spite of these developments, the role of CPES approach for handling grid level applications has been minimum. Furthermore, CPES approach encapsulating both the physical and cyber domain has not been investigated. Among the various problems that can be tackled using CPES approach, we focus on the power system state estimation problem that has been studied in energy grids. The PSSE determines the most likely state of the power system from a set of measurements that are captured using supervisory control and data-acquisition systems. The role of PSSE is crucial for many energy management applications such as optimal power flow, monitoring, and contingency analysis. In addition, PSSE also provide snapshots of the network to energy management system applications developed by many third party applications. The role of PSSE in enabling optimal power flow [16, 33], bad-data detections, market

  operations etc. [17, 32] has been studied in literature. Currently, there are various tools, standards and models used for capturing the various aspects of PSSE. The physical models used for PSSE have been reviewed in [18]. Among the communication standards used for modelling PSSE, IEC 61850 [19] and Common Information Models (CIM) standardized by the International Electromechanical Commission have been studied for implementing the grid. The investigation in [20] viewed PSSE as one of the applications enabled by IEC 61850 without much description about the implementation. The role of IEC 61850 in implementing PSSE for a distribution grid has been proposed in [21]. Similarly, CIM models for state estimation have been proposed in [22–24]. The recent research are converging more towards the use of CIM as a standard for data communication in smart grids (see, [25–30] and references therein). The main contribution of the paper is a CPES architecture and model that can be used to engineer smart grids. The proposed architecture has three layers: physical, middleware and applications. The physical layer is the grid with the various sensors and devices. Typically the grid is composed of various components and devices that have various communication protocols, standards and manufactured by different vendors. Aggregating information from them is difﬁcult. To overcome this, a middleware is used. The top layer of the CPES architecture is the application layer that needs to obtain the data from the middleware map it into the grid model. To model the grid, we use the common information model as it is easily extendable to model various aspects of the grid. The CIM model is tailored to the needs of the PSSE and is used for information exchange to the applications layer as well as among the applications. The application layer in addition contains the optimization and measurement models for mapping the physical variables of the grid. Furthermore, the implementation aspects of the PSSE in the application layer is also presented. The CIM based model maps the cyber aspects with the network topology and to the physical entities directly. Furthermore, the PSSE is also simultaneously realized in the application layer. This leads to a new approach for modelling and realizing future energy management applications. It is worth to mention here that the middleware part of the architecture is beyond the scope of this investigation and has not been treated in detail. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the implementation aspects of the PSSE. Section 3 presents the CPES architecture and model. Section 4 presents the case study and implementation in the distribution network in Steinkjer. Conclusions and future course of investigation are discussed in Sect. 5.  
   
  2 Power System State Estimation The main objective of a power system state estimator is to estimate the state of each bus, namely voltage magnitude and phase angle, using the set of redundant measurements, usually affected by errors. The set of phasors representing the complex bus voltages are called static state of the system. The State estimator, initially developed as an engineering tool, is slowly transforming into a decision support system that assists control and monitoring tasks. As with any estimator, the SE outcome is an approximation of the current network state. Moreover, from a high level supervisory control and data acquisition module, sensors measurements arrive with different time-granularities so  
   
  Cyber-Physical Energy Systems Approach for Engineering Power System  
   
  121  
   
  that measurements and state estimate can differ in phase. The physical component of the PSSE can be broken down into two parts: hardware and software. The hardware part consists of the SCADA system that collects the real-time information from the remote terminal units installed in various substations. RTU measurements include active and reactive power flows, power injections, current magnitude, voltage magnitude and phase angles. Figure 1 shows the hardware components of PSSE. Till recently, a direct measurement of voltage phase angles was considered impossible. Then, the introduction of phase measurement units (PMUs) has been made that measurement possible. In recent times, the PMUs have signiﬁcantly improved the measurements accuracy by using the GPS to synchronize the time signals with an accuracy close to 1 µs.  
   
  Fig. 1. Hardware components of the PSSE  
   
  The software components of the PSSE are: measurement pre-ﬁltering, topology processor, observability analysis, state estimator, bad-data detection and bad-data suppression. The pre-ﬁltering block checks for error measurements and unusual data. The topology processor builds the network topology required for the PSSE application using the knowledge of the physical topology. The SE algorithm then computes the state estimates. Finally, the bad data processor checks for the bad data and eliminates the error values. The state estimator block uses iterative algorithms that have ﬁnite convergence time for building the PSSE. In summary, the SE operation serves as a large-scale ﬁlter between remote measurements and high-level applications that constitute the Energy Management System (EMS).  
   
  3 CPES Model Energy management in smart grids require orchestrating several hardware platforms, protocols and devices from multiple vendors. The EMS applications should get access to different data from these various devices. A good solution to solve the heterogeneity

  issue is to design a middleware. The architecture of such a middleware is shown in Fig. 2. The bottom most layer is the physical layer that models the energy grid. The middleware aggregates the data from the grid and provides it to the PSSE application. The application layer houses the third party and other applications for EMS such as the PSSE. Energy grids typically consider the energy flows in the physical grids, however to orchestrate the smart grid, the information from heterogeneous sensors needs to be aggregated by the middleware and provided to the applications. The physical layer models the energy flows and transfers. This model needs to be augmented with the data model for implementing the EMS. The network topology and other physical aspects needs to be captured in the application layer. The flow of information among the different layers is deﬁned by the CIM model. Here, we do not consider the implementation aspects of the middleware and the services are not elaborated. To propose the CPES model, we propose a top-down approach wherein the application layer has the PSSE application. The PSSE application requires measurements from the grid that is aggregated using the middleware. To process the information, the topology and model of the grid needs to be known. For this purpose the CIM models are used.

  The PSSE EMS application is developed in JAVA. In order to facilitate information interoperability an application program interface (API) is deﬁned. This API can enable different applications and services to access data and exchange information independently, alleviating difﬁculties with intrinsic data representation. The CIM speciﬁes the semantics of the API. This also eliminates the difﬁculty of interfacing lower level

  components with the physical application. The CIM model can be used to build semantics into the middleware as well. The lower level components transmit the information using dedicated communication infrastructure. There are different information models and data formats for the data. As the CIM provides interface to the applications, they are oblivious to the physical entities connected to the grid. This leads to a service oriented architecture for the middleware. In what follows we describe the measurement, optimization and grid model captured using CIM. The implementation aspects of the application layer and different aspects considered in the design of PSSE. A. Measurement Model The State Estimator routine is used to monitor the power network status during normal operation, where the system is in quasi-steady state responding to slowly varying load demand and power generation. It is also assumed that, in the three-phase transmission system, all loads are balanced and all transmission lines are fully transposed so that the network can be represented by its single phase equivalent diagram. Given the single phase diagram, the network is mathematically modelled and all the measurements, previously described Sect. 2, are written as function of the network state variables (i.e. voltage phasors). The equations modelling the power network are nonlinear and do not take into account all possible errors due to the uncertainties in the network parameters, e.g., metering errors and noise that may be introduced through the telecommunication systems. Consider a vector z as the set of all available measurements. This vector can be expressed in terms of power network state variables x as follows: 2  
   
  3 2 3 2 3 h1 ðx1 ; x2 ; . . .; xn Þ z1 e1 6 z2 7 6 h2 ðx1 ; x2 ; . . .; xn Þ 7 6 e2 7 6 7 6 7 6 7 z ¼ 6 .. 7 ¼ 6 7 þ 6 .. 7 ¼ hðxÞ þ e .. 4 . 5 4 5 4 . 5 . zm  
   
  hn ðx1 ; x2 ; . . .; xn Þ  
   
  ð1Þ  
   
  em  
   
  where h(x) is the measurement model, x is the state vector, and e is the error in measurements. The measurement model h(x) is a nonlinear model that maps the state vector to the measurement. B. Optimization Model The mathematical formulation of the presented state estimation problem is based on the maximum likelihood concept. Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a random variable maximizes the likelihood function, which is deﬁned based on assumptions of the problem formulation. The ﬁrst assumption, as previously mentioned, is that the errors are distributed according to a Gaussian (or normal) distribution, with the expected value equal to zero. Thus, a random variable z is said to have a normal distribution if its probability density function f ðzÞ is given as follows: 1 1 2 f ðzÞ ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ e2ðzlÞ=r 2pr  
   
  ð2Þ  
   
  124  
   
  S. Srinivasan et al.  
   
  where l is the expected value (or mean) of z ¼ EðzÞ and r is the standard deviation of z. The previous property holds for the i.i.d. assumption. The second assumption implies that the joint probability density function (pdf) of a set of m measurements can be obtained by taking the product of individual pdfs corresponding to each measurement. The result product function is called likelihood function for the set of m measurements: fm ðzÞ ¼ f ðz1 Þf ðz2 Þ. . .f ðzm Þ  
   
  ð3Þ  
   
  Essentially the likelihood function is a measure of the probability of observing a given set of measurements in vector z. For this reason we are interested in ﬁnding the parameter vector that maximize this function. In order to simplify the procedure of determining the optimum parameters, the function is commonly replaced by its logarithm, obtaining the so called log-likelihood function. Hence, the MLE of the state x can be found by maximizing the log-likelihood function for a given set of observations, z1 ; z2 ; . . .; zm . Thus, the following optimization problem is formulated: minimize JðxÞ ¼  
   
   m  X zi  l 2 i  
   
  ri  
   
  i¼1  
   
  ð4Þ  
   
  Let us deﬁne, ri ¼ zi  li is the residual of measurement i. The expected value E ðzi Þ of measurement zi , can be expressed as li ¼ E ðzi Þ ¼ hi ð xÞ, where hi ð xÞ is a nonlinear function relating the system state vector x to the i th measurement.

  C. Smart Grid Model As stated earlier CIM has been chosen as a representative mechanism for the smart grid model. The CIM models provide an abstract model for the power network using uniﬁed modelling language (UML). The CIM represents the power system entities using an object oriented approach as classes, attributes, methods and association as deﬁned in IEC 61970 [25] and IEC 61968 [26] standards. The standard IEC 61970-301 provides as semantic model for the power system components at an electrical level and their interrelationships. The IEC 61968-11 extends the semantic models to include the data exchanges for scheduling, asset management and other market operations. Although, CIM contains most classes and their associations to represent the power system, still object models need to be adapted for implementing speciﬁc application. CIM models can be adapted by deﬁning new classes, subclasses, methods and attributes. CIM Proﬁle: A proﬁle is a delimitation of CIM which consists of a subset of classes and attributes that specify information conceptually and the relationships among the different objects. A subset of IEC 61970-456 deﬁnes the CIM necessary to describe the PSSE results. A modular approach is used in the development of CIM proﬁle that four proﬁles: Equipment, Measurement, Topology, and State variable Proﬁle. The equipment proﬁle models physical elements of the network such as network, loads, generators, and switches. The measurement proﬁle contains the measurement information such as active and reactive power, voltages, load angles etc. Topology proﬁle deﬁnes the classes needed to describe the network topology considering the switching status. State variable proﬁle contains the model for deﬁning the state variables in the network. The relationship between the different proﬁles is shown in Fig. 3. The proﬁle connected at the “from” end of the arrow depends on the proﬁle at “to” end of the arrow.

  As a next step the abstract and concrete classes of the various proﬁles are deﬁned. As the treatment of all the proﬁles is beyond the scope of this investigation. Here we provide an example of the topology proﬁle (see, Fig. 4). The topology proﬁle deﬁnes the classes needed to describe how each of the equipment in the network is connected to each other. Topology is given by the association of the buses with the corresponding association of the terminals of the equipment. This way the network model is built as a branch flow model and can be directly used by the PSSE application. The state variable

  proﬁle of the CIM model is shown in Fig. 5. Similarly, the other CIM proﬁles are modelled to describe the network. In addition the abstract and concrete models required of the CIM proﬁles are described. The CIM model maps the network topology with the measurements and state variables. The CIM model deﬁnes the semantics for the PSSE API which is implemented in JAVA. The application uses the middleware services to query the sensors and update the network state using the PSSE application. The middleware services required can be broken down into low-level services and common services. The description of the middleware services are not considered in this investigation. REST interfaces are used to communicate between the middleware and application layer.

  D. Software Model of the PSSE Application The PSSE application needs to map the data aggregated from the middleware to the network topology. To this extent the application uses the InterPSS that deﬁnes the network data in the IEEE format for processing. The application implementing the PSSE is written in JAVA and to solve the optimization model in (6) GAMS solver is  
   
  128  
   
  S. Srinivasan et al.  
   
  used due to its symbolic processing capability. The APIs implementing the CIM, and libraries of the InterPSS, GAMS are integrated with the application written in JAVA to realize the PSSE for the EMS. The CPES model described above integrates the physical equations describing the energy flows in the network with the CIM to model the cyber part of the network. The resulting model encapsulates both the cyber and physical aspects of the network. Furthermore, the application software model proposed also uses the InterPSS to map the topology and uses the GAMS for realizing the PSSE. This model along with the CPES description of the network can be used to engineer energy management system application in typical smart grid. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the method provides a comprehensive framework for co-designing both the physical and cyber aspects of the network, thereby reduces the engineering efforts. Furthermore, provides an interface between the different domain engineers involved in smart grids.

  4 Case Study The CPES approach proposed in Sect. 3 was used to engineer PSSE in the energy management system of the distribution grid in Steinkjer, Norway. It is a radial distribution network that consists of a: hydro power plant with 2 generators, 32 aggregating loads, 50 link busses, and 84 transmission lines. The CIM deﬁnes the basic ontology of the set of attribute value pairs. Ontologies are often written in XML or in a Resource Document Framework (RDF), which is a suitable format for middleware information exchange through the common communication bus. The CIM standard IEC 61970-52 deﬁnes the procedure for description of the network model as a serialized RDF schema. The main concept of the RDF is called the tiple and consists of subject-predicate-object expression. An RDF document contains element that are identiﬁed by unique ID attribute and that can be referenced from other elements using that ID in a resource attribute. The CIM proﬁle for implementing the PSSE can be represented using a RDF schema document. In details, after having selected all the classes, attributes and relationship among the classes, tools such as CIMTool can be used for generating the RDF schema. As stated earlier the PSSE application uses the InterPSS and GAMS to provide the state estimates for the different applications. The CIM model also deﬁnes the information exchange among the EMS applications. The CPES engineered PSSE application is tested in the pilot distribution network. The residuals of the PSSE are used to evaluate the accuracy of the state estimates. Figure 7 shows the residuals

  computed for the real and reactive power in p.u. values. Our results show that the PSSE provided an accurate estimates with error between 2–4% for the 85 buses in the distribution network (Fig. 6).

  5 Conclusions This investigation proposed a cyber-physical energy systems approach for engineering PSSE in smart grids. The proposed approach modelled both the physical and cyber aspects of the PSSE simultaneously. The physical model was represented by the

  measurement and optimization model. While, the common information model was used to describe the cyber part of the CPES model. The proposed approach can be used to engineer PSSE applications in smart grids with heterogeneous sensors from various vendors and considering interoperability constraints. Furthermore, the proposed CPES approach can also be used for building a service oriented architecture (SOA) based middleware. The details of the implementation of the middleware are not discussed in the investigation. Extending the CPES approach to model optimal power flow with PSSE is the future course of this investigation. Acknowledgement.

  Abstract. The study of the similarity between web applications has extended alongside with the informational explosion resulted from the fast communication means through Internet. The copyright of web applications is difﬁcult to be appreciated in this domain and this is the reason for the development of novel web technologies and mechanisms of measuring the similarity between two webpages. In this paper, we will present a modality of measurement of the similarity degree between two webpages regarding the HTML tag-based webpages. The degree of similarity will be determined approximately, being dependent of the webpages used from the both websites and the tags set used in the comparison of the webpages. The selection of webpages in order to determine the degree of similarity between two webpages will be made using genetic algorithms. In the ﬁnal part of the paper there are presented the results obtained with the implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper. Keywords: Webpage

  1 Introduction The similarity is a notion which appears frequently in many domains: science, linguistics, copyright, arts, transportation etc. In the last period, different mechanisms of measuring the similarity between different objects were developed, using particularly complex algorithms and mathematical results. A variant of measuring the similarity between two objects presumes the identiﬁcation of certain character sequences which characterize adequately these objects and then these sequences are analyzed by means of speciﬁc algorithms to obtain a number which reflects the similarity. This type of algorithms is used in [4, 5]. We will use this idea in this paper for measuring the similarity of two webpages. The number that will © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E.

  be obtained to deﬁne to what extent two webpages are similar will be determined by examining the tag sequences which are used at the web pages created using HTML. The large number of ﬁles used for creating the webpages is an impediment for creating algorithms which calculate the similarity between two webpages and this is the reason for which we will use a ﬁxed number of ﬁles for this calculus. The generation of these ﬁles will be made using genetic algorithms, which will provide several variants of these ﬁles and for each variant we will use the editing distance method for the calculus of similarity, presented in detail in [7]. The main motivation for our work is the ﬁnding of the degree of similarity between two web applications. Another motivation is related to ﬁnding different methods of calculating this degree, in this paper being presented a method using genetic algorithms. In Sect. 2 we will present some deﬁnitions and examples necessary for the approximate calculus of the degree of similarity between two webpages. Section 3 will contain the presentation of the selecting modality required for the measurement of the similarity between two web pages, using genetic algorithms. In Sect. 4, we will present the modality of calculating the similarity of webpages using the results from Sect. 3. Section 5 is dedicated to the presentation of several results obtained after the algorithms presented in Sects. 3 and 4 were implemented.  
   
  2 Preliminary Notions In order to determine the similarity between two webpages which will be denoted by WA (web applications): WA1 and WA2, we will use only the ﬁles formed of HTML tags. These ﬁles have the .html and .htm extensions. To simplify the future notations, we will denote by P = {p1, p2, …, pm}, respectively with Q = {q1, q2, …, qn} the sets of web pages associated with the applications WA1, respectively WA2. Next, we will interpret by pi or qj the ﬁle which contains the tags of the corresponding web page (1  i  m, 1  j  n). In the approximate calculus of the similarity between two web pages we will not take into consideration a ﬁxed set of tags, this set being denoted by TG. For the next deﬁnitions, it is useful to denote by T1i the sequence of tags from pi which are not found in TG and by T2j the sequence of tags from qj which are not found in TG, where 1  i  m, 1  j  n. In the calculus of the similarity between two sequences of tags we will use the editing distance (or the Levenshtein distance), presented in detail in [3, 7, 11]. In the classic deﬁnition, the character strings are used, in this paper the characters being replaced by tags. In the paper [7] we have done a similar study. We will use, in this matter, some notations used in the referred paper: – DL(s, t) is the minimum number of operations to transform the string s into the string t; – d(pi, qj) is the degree of similarity between two webpages pi and qj;  
   
  Similarity of Websites Regarding HTML-Based Webpages  
   
  137  
   
  – d(pi, WA2) is the degree of similarity between the webpage pi and the web application WA2; – d(WA1, WA2) is the degree of similarity between two web applications WA1 and WA2; – ad(WA1, WA2) is the approximate degree of similarity between two web applications WA1 and WA2.  
   
  3 The Choice of Files for the Calculus of the Similarity Between Two Webpages At the notations used in the previous sections we add two natural numbers k and h with 1  k  m, 1  h  n. k and h are chosen so that the runtime of the algorithm of the calculus of the similarity between two web pages to be enclosed in limits closed to the ne calculated for all the web pages. In Fig. 1 the general scheme of the algorithm as in [3, 8] is presented. The algorithm will be used twice for generating subsets with k web pages from WA1, respectively with h web pages from WA2.

  The algorithm presented next has as input data a string of characters which represents the path where a web application can be found and a natural number k, less or equal with the number of web pages built using HTML tags, denoted by n. The web  
   
  138

  pages will be codiﬁed with numbers from 1, 2, … to n. The output data of the algorithm will be represented by a bi-dimensional array with k columns, each line representing a chromosome, namely a subset with k distinct elements from {1, 2, …, n}. The subsets obtained from the array will be distinct. The steps of this algorithm are: Step 1. The character sequence s and the number k is read. This sequence represents the path of the web application. Step 2. The ﬁles with the extension .html or .htm from the tree with the subfolders that are rooted in s are determined. The names of these ﬁles will be memorized alongside their path in the string p[1], p[2], …, p[n]. Step 3. The number of generations NoF which will be used in the genetic algorithm is read. Step 4. Using the genetic algorithm presented above, it is built a bi-dimensional array with the elements Pop[i][j], i = 1, Nocrom and j = 1, k, where Nocrom represents the number of chromosomes which will be obtained. Nocrom can be read. Step 5. The chromosome obtained at step 4 are sorted ascendingly depending on the ﬁtness functions, but these chromosomes are not distinct. This is why a new bi-dimensional array will be built. This array contains the elements PopDist[i][j], i = 1, NoCromDist and j = 1, k. Observations 1. In the genetic algorithm from the step 4, the initial population is randomly generated using the numbers from the set {1, 2, …, n}, these numbers being the genes that form the chromosomes, n being the number of web pages from WA. The chromosome is formed from k genes. The initial population used in the implementation presented in Sect. 6 has 1200 chromosomes. 2. For the ith chromosome from the population which contains the genes Pop[i][1], … Pop[i][j], …, Pop[i][k], the ﬁtness is calculated as being the sum of the degrees of similarity of between the pairs of web pages p[Pop[i][j]] and p[Pop[i][r]], 1  j r  k and it is being denoted by f(i). Thus: f ði Þ ¼  
   
  k1;k X  
   
  d ðPop½i½ j; Pop½i½r Þ  
   
  j¼1;r¼j þ 1  
   
  3. The ith chromosome is more performant than the jth chromosome if f(i) < f(j), which means that the web pages from the ith chromosome are more different to each other than the ones from the jth chromosome. 4. The mutation operation is made by identifying a number h (randomly generated) from {1, 2, …, n} which is not found in a chromosome and randomly determining a position poz in the chromosome. After that, the gene from the position poz is replaced with h. 5. For the crossover operation, chromosomes which contain at least one different number are randomly generated. The crossover of the two chromosomes with the indices i and j which have this property will be made in this way:

  139  
   
  – it is built a string of numbers with all the genes from the two arrays, denoted by x = (x1, x2, …, x2k). – the array x is sorted ascending and a string of numbers y = (y1, y2, …, yw) containing the distinct numbers form x. w > k, because of the fact that the two chromosomes has at least one gene (number) different. – two new chromosomes are built from the array y, the ﬁrst chromosome containing the ﬁrst k components from y and the second with the latter k components from y.  
   
  4 The Approximate Calculus of the Degree of Similarity Between Two Webpages In this section, we will keep the notations from the previous sections. The algorithm presented in the next lines will determine the approximate degree of similarity between two webpages WA1 and WA2, using k web pages form WA1 and h web pages from WA2. The steps of this algorithm are: Step 1. Two strings of characters s and t and the natural numbers k and h are read. These two strings represent the paths where the two webpages WA1 and WA2 can be found. Step 2. The ﬁles with the extension .html or.htm from the tree with the folders which are rooted in s are determined. The names of these ﬁles will be memorized alongside with their paths in the string p[1], p[2], …, p[m]. Step 3. The ﬁles with the extension .html or .htm from the tree with the folders which are rooted in t are determined. The names of these ﬁles will be memorized alongside with their paths in the string q[1], q[2], …, q[m]. Step 4. Using the algorithm from the Sect. 4 twice, once for WA1 and once for WA2, we determine two bi-dimensional arrays with chromosomes (web pages indexes): ðPopDist1½i½jÞi¼1;NoCromDist1;j¼1;k for WA1 respectively ðPopDist2½i½jÞi¼1;NoCromDist2;j¼1;h ; for WA2: The applications that contains the web pages with the indexes from the chromosomes from the lines of the previous bi-dimensional arrays will be denoted by (WA1i) i = 1, NoCromDist1 respectively (WA2j) j = 1, NoCromDist2. Step 5. We determine ad(WA1i, WA2j) for i = 1, NoCromDist1and j = 1, NoCromDist2. The average of these numbers will be the number which represents the approximation of the similarity between the webpages WA1 and WA2.

The algorithm presented in this section and the one from the Sect. 4 can be modiﬁed in order for other deﬁnitions of the similarity between web pages, as the well presented in [6] or [8] or other modalities of measuring the similarity between the character sequences as the ones from [1, 10, 11] to be used.  
   
  5 Implementation The implementation made in Java led to results closed to the ones obtained for the similarity between two webpages using the deﬁnition 5 from the Sect. 2, meaning the fact that all the web pages from the both webpages were included. Table 1 presents some information about the webpages used at the test of the Java program which implements the algorithms from Sects. 5 and 6. The set of tags used at the implementation of the program was made from the tags:  

  Table 2 presents some results obtained for the webpages presented in Table 1: the degree of similarity (using the algorithm from [7]) and the approximation of the degree of similarity (using the algorithm presented in this paper) (Fig. 2).

  The results obtained using the implementation of the algorithms presented in this paper shows the fact that they can be used to calculate the degree of similarity between two webpages with quite an acceptable error (generally, under 0.01). An important aspect is the fact that the presented algorithms can also be used for other modalities of deﬁning the degree of similarity between two ﬁles.

  6 Conclusions This paper showed a model for the approximate calculus of the degree of similarity between two webpages, each of them being made from several other components. Particularizing, the applications are webpages and the components are web pages with the source code built from tags. A central thing of this model is the genetic algorithm, which helps us at the generation of component subsets with certain restrictions. This type of algorithms is used in many situations, in [2, 3, 9] being presented some applications of these algorithms. The presented model can also be adapted for other modalities of deﬁning the similarity between the ﬁles that compose a web application. For a future work, we propose to create a tool which will calculate the approximate similarity between two webpages using several formulas to calculate the similarities between the ﬁles.

  Abstract. Minimum energy consumption and minimum service delay with maximizing quality of service is key to a worthy WSN. Network lifetime and network connectivity lead to optimization. However, to handle the uncertainties present in WSNs, we need powerful heuristics to solve the optimization problem. A possible way to minimize power consumption is by the use of caching popular data by optimally selecting and placing cache nodes in the network. We propose the use of a powerful searching tool and a well-known soft computing technique; a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve optimization goals in the presented work. The proposed work proceeds in two steps to give a complete optimized network system with increased network lifetime. In the ﬁrst step we use genetic algorithm to carefully select and place cache nodes in the network with aims of maximizing ﬁeld coverage and minimizing network energy usage. In the second step we perform cache consistency on the cache nodes for valid data retrieval. We use the Probabilistic Delta Consistency (PDC) with Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP) algorithm. The cache consistency algorithm is implemented on the MAC layer and comparisons are made with 802.11 MAC layer without cache consistency using metrics; routing load, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, normalized load and energy consumed. The network overhead is reduced considerably leading to speedy data access. The algorithm is designed for a clustered environment and is an extension of our previous work where we have successfully proved that genetic algorithm gives better results for node deployment when compared to the state of the art node placement algorithm ScaPCICC. The results are obtained by running the experiments on Matlab and ns2. Keywords: Genetic algorithm  Cache consistency Network  Optimization  Clustering

  1 Introduction A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is comprised of a set of several identical sensor nodes with limited CPU and storage capacity and is a special class of ad hoc networks. In a typical example, nodes are capable of sensing environmental attributes, such as temperature, light and humidity, allowing researchers to monitor an area of interest remotely, inconspicuously and continuously. Some of the unique characteristics of a Wireless Sensor Networks like ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, ability to cope with node failures, mobility, dynamic network topology, communication failures, heterogeneity of nodes, large scale of deployment, unattended operation makes their use in certain applications indispensable. Many applications for WSN have been discussed in the literature. A few include environmental/habitat monitoring, acoustic detection, seismic detection, military surveillance, inventory tracking, medical monitoring, smart spaces, process monitoring and trafﬁc management. However, to work seamlessly and achieve application and user level satisfaction, a WSN faces many challenges. The goal of achieving application-level QoS, with minimum energy consumption and minimum service delay in WSNs becomes a very challenging task. Minimum energy consumption and minimum service delay with maximizing quality of service is key to a worthy WSN. A sensor node failure due to energy depletion would lead to network partitions, path breaks, new route setup and therefore, latency in service and data provisioning. It is observed that most of the energy spent by a sensor node is during listening to the channel, data routing and sensing. Routing or data transmission is a foremost reason for high energy dissipation by sensor nodes. When compared; the amount of energy spent during computation with the energy spent during communication, it is observed that transmitting a single bit through a transceiver expends more energy than computing a single instruction on a processor. Routing in WSNs is data centric than address centric. All sensors detecting and sensing the event report to the sink generating redundancy of messages. However, one disadvantage associated with routing is every time an information is required, it has to be fetched from the source which might be several hops away from the sink. This also invokes participation of all the sensor nodes present in the path thus leading to energy drainage. Literature show tremendous contributions in the design of exceedingly competent routing algorithms for WSNs, however, even with a highly energy efﬁcient data routing protocol, a WSN that is designed for continuous monitoring application can achieve more energy efﬁciency by other means. Battery life time of a sensor node can be extended if amount of communication and computation done by a node is reduced. A possible way to minimize power consumption is by the use of caching the data. Caching of popular data can save a sensor network from exploitation of many of its scarce resources. To mention a few, caching helps in reducing amount of communication between nodes in the network, reduces network wide transmission, hence, reduces interference because of nodes, overcomes variable channel conditions, reduces network congestion, speeds data access by nodes and provides QoS with minimum energy consumption. However, caching can also considerably impact the system energy expenditure if not implemented efﬁciently; there are two vital design issues to be addressed in caching; ﬁrst selection of appropriate nodes to cache data and their

  optimal positioning, i.e., optimal cache node placement and second, is cache consistency. Because of the mobility associated with nodes, caching strategy also requires cache consistency schemes to ensure that the cached objects are consistent with those stored in the server. Our study focuses on the data access algorithms using cache for WSNs. In literature, many algorithms have been proposed to address these issues to the best possible way but very few work reflect the use of any soft computing techniques to achieve the same. Soft Computing is the fusion of methodologies that were designed to model and enable solutions to real world problems, which are not modeled, or too difﬁcult to model, mathematically. These problems are typically associated with fuzzy, complex, and dynamical systems, with uncertain parameters. The uncertainty associated with the network state information is inevitable in terms of, both, fuzziness and randomness. A powerful advantage of soft computing is the complementary nature of the techniques. Used together they can produce solutions to problems that are too complex or inherently noisy to tackle with conventional mathematical methods. In our work, we have used genetic algorithm as an optimization technique to place the Caching Nodes (CN) optimally. We also perform a Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP) [4] algorithm on the cached nodes to provide user-speciﬁed consistency prerequisites using the Probabilistic Delta Consistency (PDC) model. We have used a clustered WSN network environment with cluster head and cluster members to implement our algorithms. We use MATLAB and ns2 simulators for performing our experiments.

  Optimization helps to enhance system performance by selecting optimal point within a given set of strictures or circumstances. The key concept in optimization is to be able to make assessment of the system resources and accordingly make decisions that can minimize the exploitation of these resources to achieve the desired objective with maximized desired output. Considering WSNs, we understand that battery life time of a sensor node can be extended if amount of communication and computation done by a node is reduced. In other words, network lifetime and network connectivity lead to optimization. However, to handle the uncertainties present in WSNs, due distance between nodes, communication channel, we need powerful heuristics to solve the optimization problem and therefore soft computing has been involved to achieve the desired optimization goals in the presented work. The aim of the presented work is to optimize the placement of cache nodes in WSNs. We try to select ﬁnest number of nodes in a given WSN to serve as cache nodes for complete network coverage. This optimal number of nodes to be selected as cache nodes is a tricky task as selecting large number of CNs may create redundant messages, caching new information in their small memories will require more enhanced techniques of cache replacement. All this would lead to depletion of vital resources like sensor and network energy, overload network bandwidth and also create network

  congestion. While a smaller number of CNs may not be able to cover the entire application and may lead to network partitions hence leaving areas un-sensed while reporting an event. It has been observed that for many applications, the search space for optimization is excessively large or excessively expensive in terms of computation leading to a NP-hard search space. In such instances it is advised to use random search algorithms that also form the basis for studying non-linear programming techniques in research. Algorithms for optimization under this category are robust to noise, non-linearities and discontinuities. These random search algorithms can adapt to new environmental situations and yield optimized values even when the system parameters cannot be predicted at priori. Random search algorithms are also called as multi-objective programming methods as they can address more than one objective function for a given problem statement while maintaining coherency with the boundary conditions. Algorithms that mimic human brain and behavior have revolutionized the current available optimization methods. Some of these well-known algorithms are Memetic Algorithm (MA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Shuffled Frog Leaping (SFL), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Systems and Simulated Annealing (SA) [2]. All these techniques try to solve a problem in a comparable way; however, they still differ marginally in employing their optimization procedure. Each of these algorithms employs a depiction to suit the technique and then arrive at an optimal solution iteratively. Genetic Algorithms are powerful techniques in solving optimization problems with huge search spaces with large number of variables where usage of procedural algorithms is complicated. They can solve optimization problems which are non-linear, stochastic, non-differentiable, discontinuous or combinatorial in nature. Genetic algorithms employ evolution process observed in biological populations for selection of best off springs that lead to optimal solutions in successive iterations. This soft computing method generates chromosomes which are the optimization parameters represented in the form of bit strings that allows encoding of both discrete and continuous parameters contained in the same problem statement. An advantage of using GA is that the variables in GA take values within their described constraints and boundaries and therefore, no solutions fall out of the upper and lower limits deﬁned in the algorithm. If at all leak or violations occur it is due to functional restrictions of the design [2]. Authors Khanna et al. [5] have addressed creation of clustering with optimal cluster heads and cluster members in WSNs using GA. Their work is limited in identifying limits in large networks thereby applying GA and hence ﬁnding shortest convergence time becomes challenging. In his work, author Yang [11] uses GA for placing sink nodes optimally. Their algorithm helps in fast data delivery without much use of energy during data transmission. However, a major limitation of the work is that sink nodes can be located only at certain sites known as feasible sites. Author Youssef et al. [13], has used GA for energy efﬁcient gateway positioning to reduce data access delay. However, their work is not scalable and therefore does not allow large number of gateways in the network. Authors Yong et al. [12], have used GA in a cluster based WSN to ﬁnd optimal transmission power of cluster heads and cluster members for data transmission with

  reduced energy consumption. Their work does not consider nodes which are out of range for transmissions. Authors Mollanejad et al. [6], focus on repositioning of base stations using GA for faster data transmission. They consider a small error bound along with network parameters like residual energy and distance for optimized location allotment. However, they consider a static network with each sensor having a GPS system thereby increasing the cost. Wang et al. [10] have used GA for placing sensors which lead to an optimal path planning. However, they have not considered energy parameter in their algorithm. Author Hoyingcharoen et al. [3], have used GA for selecting optimal number of sensors to guarantee minimum detection probability. However, his work does not consider energy and connectivity of nodes. Sun et al. [9], use GA for deploying relay nodes for complete network coverage. They have modeled their system as a graph and use only a single objective function with a penalty constraint that removes any leaks in the solution from the constraint. The proposed work is an extension of our previous work [7], where we use genetic algorithm against state of the art algorithm ScaPCICC for optimal cache node placement in WSNs. We have been successful in proving that genetic algorithm performs better in terms of reducing data access delay and number of messages in the network, while achieving energy efﬁcient optimal cache node deployment in WSNs. 2.2  
   
  Cache Consistency  
   
  It is crucial that the data fetched from a cache is not old and represents a fresh version. We can achieve this by using cache consistency schemes that maintain the cached data consistent with those existing in the server (Fig. 1). Cache updates can be initiated by the server, CN or can be a cooperative process. In the server based approach also called push method, invalidation messages are broadcasted by the server to all the CNs

  indicating the update status of data items; whereas in the second case also known as pull mechanism, it is the CN that polls the server to determine the version of the cached item. However, for some applications a combination of push-pull method can be used. This cooperative cache consistency scheme allows for fresh retrievals of cached data at all points of time, however, cooperative schemes combine the advantages and the disadvantages of both the methods. Depending on the application, the server may or may not keep the record of CNs and their associated data items. If records are maintained then it is called the Stateful (SF) approach otherwise it is known as the Stateless (SL) system. Though SF approach is not scalable but yet it is more efﬁcient as server performs multicast of invalidation reports thus reducing on the number of messages in the network. SL keeps track of the Table 1. Summary of cache consistency schemes Cache consistency schemes Push model

  update history and occasionally floods the updates through invalidation messages generating extensive communication overhead. However, according to application constraints the consistency requirements can be stringent (strong consistency) leading to all time fresh version delivery otherwise can tolerate data which does not guarantee consistency also called weak consistency. If the tolerance of serving a data is never more than more than D time with the data at the server, then it satisﬁes delta consistency. In MANETS a more common technique used for consistency is called the probabilistic consistency model. Here a query is answered when the data item received back is consistent with the server with a probability of at least C, where C; (0  C  1) is a design pre-deﬁned consistency level. Table 1 gives a summary of various cache consistency schemes [14]. We employ Flexible Combination Of Push and Pull (FCPP) algorithm for cache consistency [4]. The main idea behind using FCPP is that it allows the data source node to delay the update till all the ACKs are received or until the time-out values for all the silent caching nodes expire. FCPP is a strong consistency algorithm that considers Lease protocol as a special case. FCPP beneﬁts users by providing user deﬁned consistency requirements, thus allowing invocation of Pull or Push mechanism whenever necessary. We now proceed to discuss the presented work in detail.  
   
  3 Proposed Algorithm 3.1  
   
  Cache Node Placement Using Genetic Algorithm - Methodology and Network Model  
   
  We propose a multi-objective GA based node placement algorithm for WSNs which optimizes the placement of cache node in WSN by optimizing the network functional parameters like ﬁeld coverage and number of sensors per CN, while minimizing network constraints like network energy usage, the number of out of coverage or unconnected sensor nodes and number of overlapping CNs. The technique is designed for a clustered WSN used for monitoring applications and focuses on positioning of three types of sensor nodes in a 2-dimensional L  L square grid conﬁguration with predeﬁned Euclidean distance between the units. It identiﬁes nodes as CNs, n1 (high signal range, HSR), n2 (low signal range; LSR). The algorithm also considers inactive sensor nodes which have no role and are silent though not dead in the network. GA in the proposed algorithm tries to situate these nodes optimally so that the ﬁeld coverage and number of sensors per CN is maximized. The design assumes placing of each sensing node on the intersection points of the square grid for complete network coverage (Fig. 2). The nodes categorized as CN, LSR, HSR, and inactive nodes sensor nodes are encoded in a row by row style with each individual represented by a bit string of size 2L2 (Fig. 3) [7]. For cache node discovery we use Scaled Power Community Index Cooperative Caching (ScaPCICC) [1]. For a given graph G = (V, E), it is deﬁned as

  PCI is deﬁned as one hop direct connection or neighbors of node v which is represented as vertex in the graph. Also known as degree of node v and C(v) is described as

  where, dv = Degree of node v Lv = # of links among dv neighbor of node v In other words, PCI value of a node indicates its control over other nodes whereas, Scaled PCI gives the minimum cardinality of all the nodes connected in the subgraph and the adjacent nodes in the dominating set of graph G. ScaPCICC displays high accuracy in selection of nodes and can work well for isolated nodes. Nodes selected using ScaPCI become the cache nodes which along with other nodes are encoded in bit string to form chromosomes that can proceed to the next level of optimization process using GA. In the proposed algorithm we use a weighted sum approach to organize all the desired objectives in a single ﬁtness function. F ¼ min

  and values of coefﬁcients ai = 1, 2, 3, .. are decided based on design constraints and experimentations. We deﬁne ﬁeld coverage consisting of components like Ncn (number of CNs sensors), number of nodes with HSR value; Nn1, number of LSR nodes; Nn2, number of inactive sensors; Ninact, number of out of range sensors; Nor and total number of sensing points; Ntotal. We deﬁne SpCN as Sensors-per-Caching Node, NetE as network energy, OpCnE is deﬁned as Overlaps-per-Caching node- Error and SORE as Sensors-Out-of-Range Error [7]. 3.2  
   
  Cache Consistency Using Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP)  
   
  Once cached nodes are created and popular or most frequently accessed data are cached then the next step is to maintain cache consistency. Cache consistency is necessary to ensure valid data access between the source node that detects the data ﬁrst and its cached copies. Maintaining cache consistency incurs heavy overhead in WSNs as different users have different consistency requirement. For example some applications require frequent updates like stock market whereas; few applications allow some tolerance level in accessing the data like weather forecast. It therefore, becomes essential to allow users to tune in to their consistency requirements leading to a flexible adaptation to data update rate in the cached nodes. This also results in a trade-off between maintaining user-deﬁned consistency requirements and consistency maintenance cost. The consistency model selected in the presented work is called the Probabilistic Delta Consistency (PDC) method. To further maintain user- speciﬁed consistency condition  
   
  152  
   
  J.R. Srivastava and T.S.B. Sudarshan  
   
  at minimum cost we use the Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP) algorithm. We will discuss each technique in detail. Probabilistic Delta Consistency allows users the flexibility to deﬁne their consistency requirements in two dimensions orthogonal to each other. The x-axis indicates the maximum tolerable deviation in d time or value that can exist between the source data and the cached copies. Whereas, the y-axis denotes the probability p, which accounts for the minimum ratio of queries answered by consistent cached copies. PDC model is versatile in setting the consistency requirements in a network. PDC represented as (p, d) helps identify the consistency level of a system. For example PDC (0, 100) indicates strong consistency whereas PDC (*, 0) indicates weak consistency (Fig. 4) [4].  
   
  Fig. 4. Probabilistic delta consistency representation  
   
  To satisfy the consistency requirement with minimum cost we use the FCPP algorithm. FCPP associates a time-out value with every cached copy based on the d and p values. Cache updates are made by the data source node by sending an (INV) message for which it receives an acknowledgement (INV_ACK) from cached nodes for valid time-out values of the cached copies. However, data updates can be postponed until it receives all the ACKs or until the time-out values of the entire un-responding nodes end or the upper limit of the acceptable delay of data update is reached. The key issue in implementing FCPP is to be able to quantify the tradeoff between consistency and cost. FCPP converts to Pull option when the time-out value 1 is shifts to zero, whereas, it transforms to Push format. FCPP works on both cache node and the data source node. On cache node the algorithm is described below: FCPP on caching node Step 1: Receive data request query (a) IF (l > 0) serve the request with the consistent cache copy; (b) ELSE // the time-out value l is decreased to zero  
   
  Energy Efﬁcient Cache Node Placement Using Genetic Algorithm

  Step 2: generate a RENEW message for a new time-out value and update copy if needed; Step3: Time-out value l is renewed; serve the user request with the updated cache copy; FCPP on the data source node Case 1: The source data is ready to be updated Step1: Send invalidation message (INV) to caching node with positive l; Step2: IF (INV_ACK is received from all cached nodes or D seconds have expired) (2.1) Update the source data; Case 2: On arrival of a RENEW message Step3: IF (source data update is complete) (3.1) Send updates to the caching node; Step4: IF (no pending updates) (4.1) Allow cache nodes to cache copies with time-out values 1; FCPP is implemented on to the MAC layer of the cache node. We move to the simulations and results to see the advantages of the proposed algorithms.

  heads, cluster members and the identiﬁed cache nodes locations coordinates are now fed into the ns2 simulator for maintaining cache consistency requirements. Table 3 shows the text ﬁle which is the optimized network obtained after using GA for cache placement in WSN for PCI > 70. The PCI value helps to decide the optimal number of CNs required to cover the entire network. Figure 11 shows the connectivity graph of the optimized network (degree of each node) obtained after running GA over WSN for optimal selection and placement of CNs. From Fig. 11 we can understand the roles of each sensor node in the network for one complete cycle of data transmission. A useful cluster conﬁguration is obtained only if we have a good CH (Cluster head) to CM (Cluster member) ratio so that, clustering covers the entire network using minimum network energy enhancing network lifetime. The optimal ratio of CH to CM for N nodes organized in a clustered architecture is given by CH fraction [8]. CHFrac ¼ CH=N

  5 Conclusions and Future Work In the presented work we propose a scheme for cache node selection and optimal placement of selected cache nodes in WSNs using genetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses a multi objective ﬁtness function and aims at minimizing the network energy usage during data transmission, thus resulting in an increased network lifetime. The technique is designed for a clustered WSN used for monitoring applications. The work further progresses by performing cache consistency on the cached nodes to guarantee valid data retrieval by users. To achieve this we use the Flexible Combination of Push and Pull algorithm which is implemented over the 802.11 MAC layer. The algorithm FCPP is run on cached nodes and data source node for valid data access by users. The cache consistency algorithm is implemented on the MAC layer and comparisons are made with 802.11 MAC layer without cache consistency using metrics like routing load, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, normalized load and energy consumed. The results obtained clearly show that cache placement using GA is effective in achieving maximum ﬁeld coverage of 89% in WSN while reducing network energy consumption thus granting an increase in network lifetime. The cache consistency algorithm FCPP further helps the network in faster data retrieval without message overheads generated in the network. It proves to be a very convenient choice for users to tune their consistency requirements with ease and at the same time avoid too many transmissions in the network thus leading to an energy efﬁcient network system. However, the algorithm FCPP is limited when frequency of data updates are high and the network is unstable. FCPP algorithm performs best when

  the user requirements are more severe. The experiments were completed using MATLAB and ns2 simulator. For future work, we propose enhancement in the MAC layer to further improvise on the results. We would also like to consider varied needs of dissimilar users for data retrieval using FCPP. We ﬁnally propose to deal with situations with mobile base stations. Conflict of interest.

  Introduction  
   
  The extraordinary evolution of information technologies in the medical sector is motivated by political, professional and industrial wills. Currently, Telediagnostic is considered as the most potential sector in telemedicine [11–15]. It allows two or several medical teams to exchange medical information and to comment on it in a context of diagnosis help. This sector is the result of the creation of “proﬁciency poles” that is involved by the medical hyper specialization. Given the importance of this sector in the improvement of the care quality, the reduction of treatment costs and the universalization of the medical practices and knowledge, it is necessary to optimise this class of applications. To do this, both encryption and compression must be performed [4]. Various encryption schemes for JPEG2000 images have been proposed [16,17,19,26,30,35,36].

  together to reduce the overall processing time [6,7,20,25,28,34], but they are either insecure or too computationally intensive and may induce degradation of coding eﬃciency. In fact, network communication, especially on the World Wide Web, can be intercepted. Therefore, there is a risk of placing at the disposal of eavesdroppers the secrecies of patients’ state during the transmission of medical data through a non-protected network. Thus, the encryption of the medical image is imposed to assure the deontology and the safeguard of patient medical secrecy. In particular, the asymmetric encryption can also be used to assure the authentication of medical image transmission. In addition, because of the important size of medical images after the digitalisation, we must compress them in order, ﬁrst, to improve the capacity of storage, and second to optimize theirs transmission through networks (reduction in the transmission time and in the obstruction of networks). To satisfy these conditions, the classic approach consists in applying a compression algorithm to the medical image [4,27]. The output is then encrypted with an independent cryptographic algorithm. Unfortunately, the processing time in classical cryptographic algorithms is too long to satisfy the Telediagnostic required speed because this type of application is mainly used in a case of emergency. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the Sect. 2, the encryption algorithm RSA and the JPEG2000 still image compression algorithm are brieﬂy described to facilitate the development of our proposed algorithm. Section 3 presents the principle of our approach. Then, the proposed encryption and decryption procedure is detailed. After that, the robustness of our algorithm against the diﬀerent types of attacks is discussed. Finally, the advantages of our algorithm are enumerated. Section 4 concludes the paper.

  Background The Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm: RSA  
   
  The RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that was invented by Rivest et al. [31]. It may be used to provide both conﬁdentiality and authentication, and its security is based on the intractability of the integer factorization. The cryptosystem RSA utilizes two distinct keys: the public key and the private key. The ﬁrst type can be communicated freely, through an insecure channel, to all the correspondents susceptible to exchange data with the possessor of the private key. On the other hand, the private key must remain conﬁdential [2] (Fig. 1). 2.1.1 Key Generation For the creation of an RSA public key and a corresponding private key, each person X should, ﬁrst, generate two large random (and distinct) primes p and q, that have roughly the same size and then compute [29]: n = p × q and φ = (p − 1)(q − 1)

  Afterwards, he should select a random integer e: 1 < e < φ, such that gcd(e, φ) = 1 Next, the extended Euclidean algorithm is used to compute the unique integer d : 1 < d < φ, such that e · d ≡ 1(modφ) As result, X’s public key is (n, e) and X’s private key is d [29]. 2.1.2 Algorithm Let’s suppose that a person Y wants to send encrypted data to X who must be able to decrypt these encrypted data. If the size of n in bits is t, the encryption processing requires, ﬁrstly, the break of data into k bits of blocks and the conversion of these bocks into their decimal representation (m). To encrypt each integer m, which is in the interval [0, n−1], Y should obtain X’s public key (n, e) and compute the corresponding c: c = me mod n Convert this c into binary representation, redo this operation with all the k bits of blocs, and ﬁnally send the encrypted data to X. After doing all the necessary conversions and breaks, X should use the private key d to recover m from c [29]: m = cd mod n The RSA adds a very signiﬁcant beneﬁt: it can serve to authenticate the sender of the data (e.g. a digital signature) [9,10,21]. In fact, the RSA keys are complementary: if one encrypt with a public key, it must use the private key for recovering the encrypted data (Fig. 2). Inversely, if one encrypt with a private Private Key (d) Original Image

  key, it must use the public key to recover the encrypted data. Therefore, when X encrypts his own image with his own secret key, Y will be able to use the X’s public key to decrypt the image, and in this case, Y is certain that it is X who sent him the image because he is the only person who possess the secret key. 2.1.3 Security The security of the RSA algorithm is generally equivalent to the hardness of the factoring problem. In fact, to ﬁnd the private key d, the only possibility is the factorization of n [33]. However, we need to be careful in the choice of the key size for RSA because of the increase in computing power and the continuing reﬁnements of the factoring algorithms [33]. The last factoring record was achieved on December 12, 2009 when a sixinstitution research team led by T. Kleinjung threw down a challenge to decrypt RSA-768 number. The eﬀort took almost 2000 2.2 GHz-Opteron-CPU years according to the submitters, just short of three years of calendar time [22]. 2.2  
   
  JPEG2000  
   
  The JPEG2000 standard was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) [1], also denominated as ISO/IEC 15444. It’s an image compression algorithm that allows great ﬂexibility, not only for the compression of images, but also for the access to the compressed data, such as the several progressive decoding modes: by resolution, by quality, by position or by region. Currently, this standard is divided into fourteen distinct parts, where Part 1 [18] describes the core coding system and Part 2 its extensions. However, only the ﬁrst part reached the International Standard (IS). This part describes mainly the decoding algorithm and the compressed data format: the codestream is the result of a juxtaposition of headers containing coding parameters and bit streams (a compressed form of image data). Since our approach is about the application of a partial encryption in the JPEG2000 ﬁle format, only a short preview about the codestream building will be presented in the next paragraph. The JPEG2000 ﬁle format (JP2 format): This format provides a foundation for the storing application of the speciﬁc data (metadata). A JP2 File represents a collection of boxes (Fig. 3) which design a building block deﬁned by a unique box type and length [1]. As shown in Fig. 4, four ﬁelds compose a box: the LBox, TBox, XLBox, and DBox ﬁelds. The LBox ﬁeld speciﬁes the length of the box in bytes. The TBox ﬁeld indicates the type of box (i.e., the nature of the information contained in the box). The XLBox ﬁeld is an extended length indicator that provides a mechanism for specifying the length of a box the size of which is too large to be encoded in the length ﬁeld alone. If the LBox ﬁeld is 1, then the XLBox ﬁeld is present and contains the true length of the box. Otherwise, the XLBox ﬁeld is not present [1]. The DBox ﬁeld contains data speciﬁc to the particular box type. Some of the JP2 File boxes are independent, and some of those boxes contain other boxes.

  In this section, we will develop the proposed JPEG2000 based cryptocompression algorithm. This novel scheme concerning the application of a partial encryption to the JPEG2000 ﬁle format (Fig. 6). Firstly, the principle of the novel approach, on which our algorithm is based, is presented. Second, the proposed robustness of our algorithm to the diﬀerent type of attacks is proved.

  Principle of Our Approach  
   
  If we examine the JP2 File structure attentively, we conclude that most of the information in this type of ﬁle is independent (Structure in packet). Therefore, to design an eﬃcient crypto-compression algorithm, we must touch the totality of the ﬁle structure. Since the JP2 File format is composed of boxes, and the ﬁrst 32 bits (Lbox) of every box contain the box length information. Actually, the basic idea of our approach consists of encrypting only the Lbox part of every box in the JP2 File format excepting the boxes included in a superbox. Consequently, it will be impossible to recover the original data because the correct box length is unknown. As a result, the image is protected. 3.2  
   
  Encryption Algorithm  
   
  In Sect. 2, it is noted that the principle of the RSA algorithm consists of encrypting a blocs of K bits (where K is the length in bits of the RSA key). Hence, if one uses the RSA algorithm for encrypting, the length L of the data that can be encrypted, in bits must be a multiple of K : L = n × K (n is an integer)

  Since it is possible that the Lbox bit sequence is not a multiple of K bits, we propose the following encryption procedure: • Regrouping all the Lboxes in a structure of a contiguous bit sequence without changing their order (Fig. 7a). This (32 × B) bit sequence must be placed at the beginning of the JP2 File (where B represents the number of JP2 File boxes excepting those that are included in a superbox). • Adding 32 bits in order to indicate the length of the Lbox sequence length (32 × B bits) because the recovering of the original data requires the transmission of the Lbox sequence length. This few added bits must also be placed at the beginning of the JP2 File but before the Lbox sequence (Fig. 7b). • Determine an integer N that veriﬁes: N < K and (32 + 32 × B + N ) is a multiple of K Then, we encrypt the (32+32×B+N ) bits with the RSA encryption algorithm (Fig. 7c). For decryption the encrypted data in the reception, we must: • Decrypt the K bits from the beginning of JP2 File. The ﬁrst 32 decrypted bits allow the determination of the Lbox sequence length (32 × B bits) (Fig. 7d). • Search the integer N, with the same way that is employed at the encryption stage. Once N is determined, we must decrypt the remaining encrypted data: [(32 + 32 × B + N ) − K] bits. • Delete the ﬁrst 32 bits that indicate the Lbox sequence length. • Place the new ﬁrst 32 bits (corresponding to the Lboxes of the ﬁrst Box in JP2 File) just after the Lbox bit sequence. Consequently, the length of the ﬁrst box is known. The second 32 bits are placed just after the end of the ﬁrst box. Since the length of the second box is known, we can place the next 32 bits at the end of the second box and so forth until all the Lboxes in their original places (Fig. 7e). After the decryption stage, the original image is recuperated by decoding the resulting JP2 File with any classical JPEG2000 decoder. 3.3  
   
  Security  
   
  In this part, we discuss the robustness of our crypto-compression algorithm against diﬀerent attacks through the cryptanalysis that is the study of breaking encryption algorithms. In this discussion, we assume that the cryptanalyst have full access to the description of the algorithms, as well as full access to the insecure channel through which the image is transmitted [33]. The security of our image cryptosystem will be analysed for the following four types of attacks, such as exhaustive key search attack, cipher image-only attack, known-plain image attack, and chosen-plain image attack. In the Exhaustive key search, the cryptanalyst tests each of the possible keys one at a time until the correct plain image is recognized [8]. Since we use

  the RSA keys for the encryption and decryption of the box bit sequence in our algorithm, the break of our algorithm with this type of attack is equivalent to the test of all the possible RSA Keys. In the cipher image-only attack, the cryptanalyst has access only to several images that are encrypted with the same key. The cryptanalyst attempts to recover the corresponding plain image or the decryption key [8].

  Since it is impossible to recovering the RSA decryption key, and it is impossible to recovering any information about the original data without the acquaintance of the length of the JP2 File boxes (Lbox), our algorithm is robust against this type of attacks. In the Known-plain image attack, the cryptanalyst has access to the cipher image and the corresponding plain image of several images encrypted with the same key. The cryptanalyst attempts to recover the key or to design an algorithm to decrypt any image that is encrypted with the same key [33]. In the case of our algorithm, the encryption is made on a bloc of K bits (RSA principle). The result of the RSA encryption of two original K bits blocs that contain few diﬀerent bits is two K bits blocs that are completely diﬀerent. Since the original bit sequence of two similar images contain certainly few diﬀerent bits, it is impossible to ﬁnd a relation between the original and the encrypted blocs. Consequently, it is useless to cryptanalyse our algorithm with a know-plain image attack. In the Chosen-plain image attack, the cryptanalyst is allowed to choose the plain image that is encrypted, and observe the corresponding cipher image. The cryptanalyst’s goal is the same as that in a known-plain image attack. The cryptanalyse of our algorithm is equivalent to that of the bit sequence that is encrypted with RSA encryption algorithm. As a consequence, the break of our crypto-compression algorithm with the chosen plain image attack is equivalent to that of the RSA technique with this type of attack. 3.4  
   
  Advantages of Our Scheme  
   
  • Our algorithm is rapid. In fact, we encrypt only the Lbox part (32 bits) from the whole information that can be contained in the JP2 File. Therefore, our approach allows an enormous reduction of the encrypting-decrypting processing time. • Our algorithm perfectly preserves the performances of the JPEG2000 compression algorithm [32] because the encryption is made after all the compression stages, and therefore, it does not tamper with the compression ratio. The 32 bits, which are added to communicate the Lbox bit sequence length, are too negligible, therefore, one cannot consider this fact as an inconvenient. • Moreover, our algorithm is secure. In fact, it is demonstrated in Sect. 3 that the security of our crypto-compression system is equivalent to that of the RSA algorithm. This security depends essentially on the key length. According to the RSA factoring records, if we use a key size in the range of 1024 to 2048 bits, we can aﬃrm that our algorithm is robust to the diﬀerent attacks for many years. • Our algorithm is adapted to the medical image transmission in Telediagnostic [3,5,23,24]. In addition, since RSA permits the authentication of the sender of the medical image [9,10,21], we can assure a secure and an authentic medical image communication with our algorithm.

  Conclusion  
   
  In this paper, we proposed a new crypto-compression algorithm that signiﬁcantly reduces the encryption and decryption time and can assure a secure and an authentic transmission in medical image communication. Based on the structure of the JP2 File, which is based on a succession of box and superbox, we developed, in this work, an original approach concerning the encrypting in JP2 File only the part that indicates the length of the boxes (the Lbox). Given the originality and the eﬃciency of this approach, the proposed algorithm, which is derived from, is rapid, secure, and preserves the excellent performance of JPEG2000 algorithm and adapted to the medical image transmission in Telediagnostic sector. In addition, our algorithm can be applied in many other telecommunication sectors like Tele-expertise, secure broadcasting, and distributed image retrieval.

  Abstract. Given the multitude and diversity of smart devices surrounding us, along with the variety of applications distributed on these smart devices, this paper proposes the architecture for a platform that will be used to interconnect different smart devices in terms of hardware capabilities and software features, making feasible the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The paper deﬁnes the architecture of the platform, expanding the functionality and correlation between modules that make up the platform, and proposes a software representation of a Thing and also a software representation of a Context as used in the IoT network. Using both software representations, platform modules manage tasks that discover all available devices in a surrounding area and create proper context for devices to collaborate, schedule smart device communication and establish communication between available devices in the network. The great advantage of the proposed solution is that it provides an open platform, extensible from an architectural point of view with the possibility to integrate with new smart devices in order to enlarge the IoT network.

  1 Introduction A mobile device can be described as being a computational device having a hardware structure similar to that of a personal computer (PC) and also a processing power compared to it. The main design feature of all mobile devices is that they are that small that a person can easily move a device from one place to another. Usually their dimensions are basically compared to that of a human hand. The evolution of mobile devices to what we now deﬁne as being a mobile device took place in quite a small period of time. The impact of the technological development in this direction was great on society affecting it on different levels such as economics, social media, commerce, press, culture, and nevertheless having the greatest impact on the communication level in the society. Below there are deﬁned 5 periods in the evolution of mobile devices:

  – The Brick (1973–1988) - this is the ﬁrst known era in the mobile telephony as in this period the fundamentals of future cell phone communication were being put in place along with the appearance on the market of the ﬁrst mobile phone (cell phone) invented by Martin Cooper of Motorola company in 1983 [1]. – The Candy Bar (1988–1998) - this era represents one of the biggest leaps in the mobile technology. During this period the design of the cell phones changed drastically both because the usage of second-generation (2G) technology and the increased density of cellular sites [1]. – The Feature Phone (1998–2008) - Taking in consideration the technological advancement to the mobile devices, this era is considered having the lowest impact. Most of the changes occurred to the mobile devices were at a software level as software features were developed to make use of the available hardware such as music listening applications, photo taking applications, game applications. The most groundbreaking change was the introduction of the internet and the addition of GPRS modules along with the usage of the new 2.5G network [1]. – The Smartphone (2002–present) - This era overlapped the one before as there is no clear difference between devices developed during the previous era and this one. Though introducing the internet on a mobile phone might be the event that triggered the so called smartphone era, the real route was made when introducing a common operating system (OS) on each of the devices developed. This addition led to the possibility of developing OS based application which gave birth to the concept of smartphone (a phone that is as smart as a PC). Alongside the development on a large scale of smartphones companies started to extend the area of development creating other smart devices such as smart TV’s, smart watches, smart cards, smart boards, smart pads, smart fridges, smart locks etc. [1]. – The Touch (2009–present) - This era overlaps the one before and is related to the introduction of the touchscreen technology on smart mobile devices but also on simple smart devices. The ﬁrst touchscreen technology was implemented by Apple Inc. on their ﬁrst iPhone and since then every smartphone uses it. As with smartphone technology, touchscreen technology began to be used increasingly more and applied to a number of existing smart devices, nowadays having touchscreen smart TV’s, touchscreen smart watches, touchscreen fridges touchscreen laptops etc. [1].  
   
  2 An Overview of the Used Concepts 2.1  
   
  Internet of Things (IoT)  
   
  During the mobile device development evolution most of the device could communicate between them only by using the GSM network, therefore the devices were mainly used as mobile phones with no possible way to interconnect them. This was mostly related to the fact that there was a limitation of the communication environments that the mobile devices possessed.  
   
  178  
   
  A. Gal et al.  
   
  Along with the development of smartphones with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules applications that use these modules to exchange data were more often developed. Most applications exchanged address book information such as contact entries, text messages, and call history but there were also applications developed to exchange ﬁles such as music or photo ﬁles. With the development of these devices and applications the need of having a live interconnection for exchanging relevant data between the existing devices has increased to a point that the concept of Internet of Things appeared. The Internet of Things can be deﬁned as being a network on a global scale for interconnecting smart devices (Things) around the world. Making a comparison with the internet as we know it where people are the agents of communication and data transferred between people is mostly referring general social information, the IoT uses Things as agents of communication, while the data transferred between the Things represent relevant data for the Things engaged in the process of communication. As the concept is being still in early stages there are several possible interpretations of the Things that make up the IoT. Considering the current development of smart devices focused mostly on the home automation services, a possible basic IoT infrastructure can be seen in Fig. 1. All smart devices in Fig. 1 play the role of Things in the IoT infrastructure [2, 3].  
   
  Fig. 1. Basic IoT infrastructure  
   
  In particular, the simplest use of the IoT, by referring to Fig. 1 shown above, could be that of a user being able to just power on/off the smart TV from a simple TV Manager application the user has installed on the smartphone he owns. When referring to the term home automation a more complex infrastructure of the IoT could be represented by involving a lot more Things in the process of automating the home. Things like temperature sensors, pressure sensors, humidity sensors or light sensors embedded in equivalent smart devices can give feedback upon action that could be taken to adjust the ambient comfort in the home. The actions taken to adjust the environment could be done by Things like windows’, air conditioners’, dehumidiﬁers’, electric heaters’, louvers’ all developed as smart devices that could be controlled remotely like in Fig. 2 [3].

  179  
   
  Fig. 2. Complex IoT infrastructure  
   
  By taking in consideration various points of interest, the IoT infrastructure can be extended by adding Things relevant in ﬁelds of study like health care, smart buildings, waste management, smart roads, social media and a lot more ﬁelds where it can be possible to build a level of abstraction so that Things can be developed to serve purposes like people’s security, replacement of human actions, increased comfort level in an environment, reducing the possibility of human error, etc. In an ideal IoT world, smart devices will serve users by doing autonomous work behind the scenes, accomplishing the ultimate purpose for which such an enlarged IoT infrastructure is created, that being interconnectivity between devices and services that work together to do something useful for mankind [3, 4]. 2.2  
   
  Context-Aware Computing  
   
  To present in a clear light the essential aspects of the proposed platform it can be mentioned that like many current architectures proposed for implementation of IoT infrastructure, IoThings was also designed taking in consideration the paradigms of context-aware computing, especially emphasizing on the main attribute of any context-aware system namely the adaptation of the system to its location, to the people and objects in the system or connected to the system, and also to the changes of the objects over time [5, 6]. The concept was developed based on the ubiquitous computing paradigm proposed in the early 1990’s and it refers to a suite of mobile systems that can take information from their environment and adapt to it by taking appropriate decisions. The core  
   
  180  
   
  A. Gal et al.  
   
  elements of these context-aware systems are represented by the context information and the actions (decisions) taken to adapt the mobile systems to the context at a certain point in time and space. The platform presented in this paper follow the lines drawn by both the context-aware computing concept and IoT concept, proposing a modular platform architecture that encapsulated core aspects from both concepts presented above with the purpose to create a context-aware IoT network where devices can interconnect forming the Internet of Things [7, 8].  
   
  3 IoThings - Software Level Concepts IoThings is a platform designed to support a series of smart devices that are different in terms of hardware functions and could run under different or same operating systems. The platform is designed, to have independent modules overlapping each of the functions of the platform, altogether coordinating the devices to adapt to the environment they reside in, for creating the proposed context. Due to the focus on the context-aware computing concept, the platform is structured around the term of context information. As the platform is being designed for implementing an IoT solution platform, all the smart devices that use the platform are represented as entities belonging to a certain context, and all relevant information about a smart device is translated in a context entity information [9, 10]. 3.1  
   
  Software Representation of a Thing  
   
  As deﬁned by the IoT concept, a Thing is represented in the real world by a smart device and its main characteristic is that it can interconnect with other Things for exchanging data, this way creating a large network of Things which eventually can create the Internet of Things. Having a multitude of various Things that are being different in terms of hardware structure, the platform deﬁnes a set of hardware functionalities that a Thing can have. For example, Things can get measures from the environment, can record sounds/videos, can move, can carry other Things, can sense proximity, can start/stop engines etc. A Thing being represented as a class at a software level, each of the hardware functionalities will be deﬁned as an interface, so for the abstraction of each function a Thing has, it will have to implement that particular interface. In Fig. 3 is presented a class diagram for the interfaces the platform supports. It should be mentioned here that the class diagram can be extended to include any other possible hardware features a Thing can own but also adapt existing features to requirements of an accepted Thing for the platform [11]. As seen in Fig. 3, a Thing represented at a software level in the IoThings platform contains the sum of all functions that that Thing is supporting at a hardware level. Going onwards the platform also reduces to a level of software abstraction the general information a Thing can have like: name, physical form, physical dimension, operating system installed on, operating system version, software version etc. As depicted in Fig. 4 the platform exposes a generic interface that the Thing will have to implement in order to work with the platform.

  Fig. 4. Deﬁned interfaces for the software representation of a Thing’s general information  
   
  The general information interface contains nine properties as below: – Name – property that deﬁnes the name of the Thing. – OperatingSystem (OS) – property that deﬁnes the operating system under which the software embedded in the Thing runs. This property is relevant in terms knowing how to handle the communication between Things that have different operating systems installed. – OperatingSystemVersion – property that gives the platform the information regarding the version of the OS and as like the one above it’s important in communication between Things running different OS/OS versions. – Form – property that represents the physical form of the Thing. As it can be seen in Fig. 4 this can have several values like: Circle, Sphere, Rectangular, Square, Cube, Triangle. – Height – property that is set to the real height of the Thing. – Width – property that is set to the real width of the Thing. – Depth – property that is set to the real depth of the Thing. – Weight – property that is set to the real weight of the Thing. – IsRound – this property is set if the Thing represented has a round shape. – Radius – this property comes with the one above and it represents the actual radius of the Thing in case it has a round shape.

  A. Gal et al.  
   
  The function of a Thing that can move is represented by the IMoveFunction interface and it contains the following: – IsMoving – property that is set whenever the Thing is in motion. This is relevant in the context of having to give the Thing a command to move knowing it is already in motion. – MoveToLocation – this method is used to give the Thing the command to move to a speciﬁed location in the available space. – LocationChanged – this event is triggered by the Thing whenever its location has been changed. This way the platform is able to locate each of the Things at a speciﬁed moment in time. To represent the capacity of a Thing to take measurements from the environment it resides in the IMeasureFunction interface propose below members: – IsMeasuring – property specifying the fact that the Thing is currently taking measurement from the environment. The property is useful when using Things that work with big data values or have time consuming sensors. – MeasuredValue – property that retains the measured value from the environment at a certain point in time. – MeasureType – this property is set to the relevant type of measurement the Thing deals with. As seen in Fig. 5 the property can have several values like: – MeasureUnit – property is set to the relevant unit of measurement used by the MeasureType property, and it can take values like:  
   
  Fig. 5. Measure types and measure units used by IMeasureFunction interface  
   
  – GetMeasurement – the method is used to retrieve the last value read by the Thing from the environment. This will also update the MeasuredValue property. – NewMeasuredValue – event is used to be triggered whenever a new value has been measure from the environment. The ability of a Thing to execute commands that have an effect on the environment is represented by the ICommandFunction and it has the following composition: – CommandType – property that can be set with the following values as in Fig. 6: Start, Stop, Open, Close, Lock, Unlock, Drag, Move, Push, Pull, Cut.

  – Status – property that is set with the result of the command’s execution, as for to know whether the command ended successfully has entered some state relevant for the context in which the Thing is. The values possible for this property can also be seen in Fig. 6. – IsExecuting – this property is set whenever a command starts its execution and is reset when the command end the execution. – ExecutionMessage – property will retain the message thrown by the command after ﬁnishing the execution. – AsyncExecuteCommand – the method is used to start the asynchronous execution of the implemented command. As the execution of a command can be time consuming this method offers the possibility to run the execution on a separate thread in case necessary in the context. – ExecuteCommand – the use of this method implies the execution of the command awaiting for it to ﬁnish, blocking the thread from where it is called. – CommandStatusChanged – this event is ﬁred up by the Thing when the status of the command in execution is changed.

  For the video ability of a Thing, the IVideoFunction interface has to be implemented having the structure below: – CanPlayVideo – property that deﬁnes whether the Thing can play or not videos. – CanRecordVideo – property that deﬁnes whether the Thing can record or not videos. – NumberOfCameras – property set to the number of available cameras that the Thing has to offer. – OptimalResolution – property set with the optimal resolution for the video. This will be used for the Thing to record/play video by setting the resolution to the one in the property. – GetVideoStream – this method is used to get the video stream from a certain camera and use it as output for any of the applications using the platform and using live streaming feature. – StartVideoPlayer – this method is used to tell the Thing to start playing a video in case it has the CanPlayVideo property set. – StartVideoRecording – this method is used to tell the Thing to start recording video in case it has the CanRecordVideo property set.

  The structure of the IAudioFunction, making available the audio representation at the software level for a Thing consists of: – HasMicrophone – property set when a Thing has a microphone incorporated for the possibility to record audio. – HasSpeakers – property set if a Thing has speakers available to play audio sounds. – SoundDevice – property specifying the sound device used by the Thing. – GetAudioStream – this method is used to get the audio stream from a certain device and use it as output for any of the applications using the platform and using live audio feature or voice recording feature. – StartAudioPlayer – this is used to start playing and audio ﬁle in case a Thing has HasSpeakers property set. – StartAudioRecording – this method is used to start recording audio is a Thing has HasMicrophone property set. Taking in consideration the context information core element of the IoThings platform, all Things known by the platform have to be included in a context so that the context-awareness paradigm is respected. To include all Things in a certain context the platform integrates the Thing concept into the context information concept by creating a context entity that encapsulates any Thing known by the platform. In order to do a better drawing of the context concept any context entity will consist in two major parts as seen below in Fig. 7.  
   
  Fig. 7. Context Entity structure  
   
  As it can be seen in Fig. 7 a Context Entity is composed of a Location Context and a Thing Context. The Thing Context is represented by the software representation of a Thing which is described above, as the Location Context represents the location of the Context Entity in the context space bordered by the IoT network that is built with the use of IoThings platform. Particularly speaking the Location Context consist of relevant information regarding the position in time and space where a speciﬁc entity is. From a structural point of view, the Location Context consists of: – GPS coordinates – if possible this is to be provided by the Thing in the Context Entity, or could be provided by entities from the same context. – Context reference – a reference to the context that the entity belongs to. – Time reference – a time reference based on where the context resides in terms of geo-location. It can contain data as local time, local day, local month [12].

  Software Representation of a Context  
   
  To be able to have an idea of how IoThings platform uses the Context concept to create an abstraction at the software level we’ll highlight some deﬁnitions of the concept. A Context could be seen as environmental information that is part of an application’s operating environment and that can be sensed by the application. This typically includes the location, identity, activity and state of people, groups and objects that are part of the environment. Another possible deﬁnition of a Context could be that of the interaction between humans and computers in socio-technical systems that takes place referring to the physical and social situation in which computational devices and environments are embedded. The context is determined by the people involved (including their background knowledge and their intentions), the objective of the interaction (including the tasks to be carried out), and the time and place where the interactions occur [13]. Given the two deﬁnitions above, IoThings platform deﬁnes the Context as being a self-aware environment, where entities different in terms of functional abilities can interact between them or with people by giving feedback with a certain status of the environment at a point in time, or accepting commands if necessary, to adjust the environment for serving a predeﬁned scope. Having this in consideration the software representation of a Context from the IoThings platform point of view consists in elements like in Fig. 8: – Name – property set with the name of the Context. – Location – a property that deﬁnes the geographical coordinates where the Context is settled. – Scope – property set with the predeﬁned scope of the Context. – Status – property giving the current status of the Context. Possible status of the Context can be determined by a full analysis of the Scope of the Context. – NetworkID – property set with the ID of a certain network (if any) where the Context establishes communication between entities owned. – AvailableContextEntities – a list of Context Entity objects that are residing in the speciﬁed Context. These entities make up the Context itself by adapting and adjusting Context variables to achieve the predeﬁned Scope. – SelfAwarePercent – property which set the percentage of self-awareness of the Context. The percentage is to be calculated depending on several factors like number of autonomous entities in the Context, number of human interactions in achieving the Scope, number of errors in executing a command in the Context etc.

  4 IoThings Architecture IoThings platform being designed for working with Things in terms of Context Entities, and respecting the used concepts, its architecture is composed of modules that provide functionalities like communication with any known Context Entity, deﬁning a Context using the available entities, managing contexts and context entities, all modules making use of the software representations deﬁned by the platform in order to interfere with the smart devices inhabiting a real context environment. The platform’s architecture, represented at the modules level is depicted in Fig. 9.  
   
  Fig. 9. IoThings architecture  
   
  a. Context Entity Service - this module represents a service exposed by the platform that gives the possibility for any Context Entity to communicate with the platform. Through this module a smart device that is deﬁned as a possible Context Entity will be known by the platform as an available Context Entity and can be used in a proper Context based on the location and the hardware functions that the device is capable of. Also the service can be used for communication between different devices that cannot communicate due to hardware/software interoperability problems. b. Context Entity Analyzer – this module deals with the analysis of all entities in terms of both location context and functions that the entity is capable of, resulting in the creation of a new Location Context where the analysed entity will be included or in the attachment of the analysed entity to an already existing Location Context. c. Context Entity Manager – this module represents the management level of the platform related to the entities communicating with the platform, and it performs three major functions: extracts all possible entities that can communicate with the platform into a Contact Entity Container, establishes communication between the external applications available to interact with a certain context via IoThings and relates any deﬁned Context with an external application or with any of the entities owned by the Context. d. Context Manager – this module represents the management level of the platform related to the contexts that are deﬁned by it. The module communicates with the Context Entity Analyzer and based on the result of the analysis manages the

  resulting Location Context in order to create a new Context or manage existing ones in a Context Container. Also this module provides information for any of the external applications regarding any context created and managed by the platform. e. Application Service – this module acts as a service exposed by the platform in order to allow external applications to communicate with it. The applications are used by people in certain environments to either get feedback from the Things in the environment, or to command Things that can be triggered actions on.  
   
  5 Conclusions This paper presents a platform which is able to manage smart devices that have different hardware functions and software installed components, by putting together two abstractions at a software level for concepts deﬁned in the Internet of Things and Context-Aware Computing ﬁelds of interests. A Thing is represented by the platform as a class that implements an interface related to general information that a Thing has, and also interfaces related to different functions that a Thing possesses. A Context is represented by the platform as a class that puts altogether relevant information that deﬁnes a context-aware system like: location, scope, status, context entities belonging to the context and self-awareness. The platform architecture is designed to communicate with all Things that are deﬁned respecting the proposed software representation of a Thing, in order to create a container with all available Things for the platform. The platform will extract Things from the container, and by subjecting them to an analysis based on the location of the Thing and its capabilities, will create Contexts that will serve a predeﬁned scope. The platform will manage both Things and Contexts in order to create an interconnection between the two terms by attaching to a Context as many Things as needed for serving the scope for which the Context was deﬁned. The connection will be translated in real situations, where smart devices forming a real environment, will adapt to be able to maintain/achieve a certain desired state of the environment. Also the platform will tend to increase the degree the self-awareness for each of the Contexts deﬁned by emphasizing the use of the Things in an autonomous mode. The platform makes available an application level where external applications can communicate with the platform for getting feedback from a certain Context or for sending commands to Things that act as actuators in the Context. In particular, the application level enables the human factor the possibility to intervene by just visualizing the state of the Context or by acting on some Things in that certain Context.

  Abstract. In Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes have limited energy and cannot be recharged. Clustering is one of the major approaches to optimize consumption of energy and data gathering. In these networks, clustering must be special to prolong network lifetime. In WSN, clustering has heuristic nature and belongs to NP-hard problems. In complex problems, search space is too big and grows exponentially. Because it takes too much time and cost, ﬁnding a deterministic optimized solution is difﬁcult in such a short time. In this situation population-based algorithms are beneﬁcial in ﬁnding optimum solutions. In this paper, a clustering algorithm is investigated and a novel idea, in line with the population-based algorithm, is presented. The proposed algorithm uses Imperialist Competition Algorithm (ICA) for the clustering of nodes. The results show that this algorithm postpones the dead time of nodes and prolongs network lifetime, compared to other discussed clustering algorithms.

  1 Introduction Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of many tiny sensor nodes. These nodes are typically equipped with battery, processor, memory and radio to send and receive data, which will be deployed compactly in the area for a speciﬁc purpose. Having gathered the required information from the environment, sensor nodes that are connected with each other via wireless links process them, and then deliver them to Base Station (BS) that is responsible for gathering information [1, 2]. A wireless sensor node (node) is a small electronic device which has a limited energy resource, and generally the battery cannot be changed or recharged. Therefore lifetime of a sensor node is absolutely dependent on battery life [3, 4]. In WSN, most of © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  the energy is consumed in data transmission, therefore approaches that reduce transmission greatly save energy and increase network lifetime. Clustering is one of the most popular approaches used in reducing energy consumption. Clustering protocols, in comparison to direct protocols, not only decrease data transmission, but also, due to load balancing between nodes, reduce energy consumption [5, 6]. Selecting Cluster Heads (CH) and cluster formation procedures must make the clusters balanced, reduce the exchange of messages and keep the time complexity constant which is independent of the growth of the network. This selection process is very challenging [1, 7]. Clustering protocols proposed in the literature are, in general, classiﬁed into two groups: clustering protocols in homogeneous networks and clustering protocols in heterogeneous networks. The important clustering protocols in homogeneous networks are LEACH [8], extensions of LEACH [9, 10], PEGASIS [11], extensions of PEGASIS [12], TCCA [13], EEHC [14], HEED [15] and TEEN [16]. The important clustering protocols in heterogeneous networks are SEP [17], BSIDR [18], DEEC [19] and extensions of DEEC [20]. Clustering has a heuristic nature and belongs to NP-hard problems [9]. In heuristic problems, search space is too big and grows exponentially. In such cases, ﬁnding a deterministic answer needs too much time and cost, therefore it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd deterministic optimized answers in a short time. In this situation population-based algorithms are beneﬁcial to determine optimum answers. Genetic Algorithm (GA) [21], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [22], Gravitational Emulation Local Search Algorithm (GELS) [23–25], Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [26–30] and Imperialism Competition Algorithm (ICA) are the popular population-based algorithms. These optimization protocols are applied to WSN to decrease the amount of data transmission and therefore prolong the network lifetime by ﬁnding the most suitable route in transmission and selecting optimal CHs [31]. These protocols are effective in many aspects like: optimal formation of clusters [32], selecting optimal nodes as cluster heads [10, 33], ﬁnding optimal number of clusters, and ﬁnding the optimal paths [34, 35]. In this paper, ICA is used for clustering. This protocol considers the conditions and limitations of WSN. In clustering topic, a protocol is needed that reduce data transmission and subsequently reduces energy consumption. This leads to an increase in network lifetime. In order to achieve these objectives, a new clustering protocol is proposed which ﬁrst clusters all nodes using ICA and then in each cluster chooses the appropriate nodes as cluster heads. By using this protocol, more energy is remained in the nodes, and the lifetime of the network increases signiﬁcantly.  
   
  2 Related Work Many algorithms in the ﬁeld of energy efﬁciency have been proposed in the past and clustering is one of the most effective methods in this ﬁeld. Following are a few of them.

  Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH)  
   
  LEACH [8] is one of the ﬁrst and most popular energy efﬁcient hierarchical clustering algorithms for WSN that is designed for reducing energy consumption. As the role of CH is rotated randomly and CHs directly forward their data to the BS with a one-hop route, this algorithm provides energy balancing. In LEACH formation of clusters and selection cluster heads, the CHs are completely distributed and there is no central coordination. CHs are selected randomly and all nodes have the same chance to be a cluster head. LEACH provides the following key areas of energy saving: • No overhead is wasted in deciding which node becomes cluster head as each node decides this independent of other nodes. • CDMA allows clusters to operate independently, as each cluster is assigned a different code. • Each node calculated the minimum transmission energy required to communicate with its cluster head and transmits with this optimized power level. 2.2  
   
  Stable Election Protocol (SEP)  
   
  SEP [17] is an extension of the LEACH algorithm. It is represented for heterogeneous networks. There are two types of node bases on initial energy and equipment: normal node and advance node. Advance nodes have more chances to be the cluster head. The other stages are similar to LEACH. This protocol improves lifetime and provides better energy balancing, compared to LEACH. 2.3  
   
  Distributed Energy Efﬁciency Clustering (DEEC)  
   
  DEEC [19] is used for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Unlike LEACH and SEP, in this protocol cluster heads are not chosen randomly, but they are selected based on residual energy. According to this, in each round, nodes that have more energy, have a better chance of becoming the cluster head. All nodes must have global knowledge of the network to calculate the residual energy in each round. This adds a large overhead on the network.  
   
  3 Imperialist Competition Algorithm (ICA) To solve the optimization problems, different methods have been proposed such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) [36], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Imperialism Competition Algorithm (ICA) is a new evolutionary optimization method inspired by imperialism competition [37]. Like other evolutionary algorithms, ICA starts with an initial population called country [38]. There are two types of countries, colonies and imperialists. Some of the best countries in the population will be imperialists and the rest become colonies, which together forms the empires. Imperialistic competition takes place between these empires. During this competition, weak empires collapse and powerful ones take possession of their colonies. The power of an empire which is the counterpart of ﬁtness function in GA, is inversely proportional to its cost.  
   
  192  
   
  A.S. Rostami et al.  
   
  After competition, the imperialists are selected and colonies are divided, then colonies move toward their imperialist. After dividing all colonies among imperialists and creating the initial empires, the competitions are started. Colonies start moving toward their relevant imperialist based on assimilation policy. Empires that cannot succeed in this competition and cannot increase their power (or at least prevent a power loss), are eliminated from the competition. This competition leads to a gradual increase in powerful empires and decrease in the weak ones. Eventually weak empires collapse and lose their power. Imperialistic competition converges to a state in which there exists only one empire and colonies have the same cost function value as the imperialist. In an N dimensional optimization problem, a country is a 1  N array. This array is deﬁned as below: Country ¼ ½P1 ; P2 . . . PN  The cost of a country is found by evaluating the cost function f at the variables (P1, P2… PN), then CI ¼ f ðcountryi Þ ¼ f ðPi1 ; Pi2 . . . PiN Þ The algorithm starts with N initial countries called Npop, and Nimp best of them are chosen for imperialists. Ncol remaining countries are colonies that each belongs to an empire. Powerful empires have greater number of colonies and the weaker one have less number of colonies. To distribute the colonies among imperialists proportionally, the normalized cost of an imperialist is deﬁned as follows: Cn ¼ maxi ci  cn  
   
  ð1Þ  
   
  where cn- is the cost of nth imperialist and Cn is its normalized cost. Imperialists began to improve their colonies and colonies move towards imperialists. This motion is shown in Fig. 1. In this movementɵ and x are random numbers with uniform distribution as illustrated in formula (2) and d is the distance between colony and the imperialist. x  Uð ; b  dÞ h  U ðc; cÞ  
   
  ð2Þ  
   
  where b is a number greater than 1. If b > 1, colonies and imperialist are closing together. c is an adjustment of deviation from the original direction. The values of b and c are arbitrary. The total power of each empire is determined by the sum of its power and average power of its colonies. TCn ¼ costðimperialistÞ þ n  meanfcostðcolonies of empiresÞg Where TCn is the total cost of n-th Empire and f is a positive number which is considered less than one.  
   
  Imperialist Competition Based Clustering Algorithm  
   
  193  
   
  The main steps of ICA are as follows: • Select some random point and initialize the empires. • Move colonies toward their relevant imperialist (Assimilation). • Randomly change the position of some colonies (revolution), If there is a colony with the imperialist. • Exchange the position of the colony and imperialist. • Until reaching similar empires. • Compute the total cost of all empires. • Pick the weakest colony from the weakest empire and hand it over to one of the empires (Imperialist competition). • Eliminate the powerless empires. • Exit if stop condition are satisﬁed, otherwise do further assimilation and continue.

  4 The Proposed Algorithm In this work a WSN is considered as composed of n nodes which are the same and have two modes: Cluster Head Nodes (CH) and normal nodes. Since the energy consumption of CHs are greater than normal nodes; appropriate CHs are chosen in each cluster that needs less energy for transferring data to the base station and for receiving data from cluster members. This protocol is part of a ﬁxed clustering algorithm and done with ICA. ICAAlgorithm consists of three phases: the set up phase, the cluster head selection phase, and the steady up phase. Set up phase is executed just once in the base station, whereas other phases are repeated in each round. In CH selection phase, appropriated CHs are chosen for each cluster. In the steady up phase, nodes gather data and then each node transfers its data to the corresponding CH’s. The CHs then transfer this received data to the base station.

  Setup Phase  
   
  In this phase, nodes are clustered into kopt cluster using ICA. After nodes are located in their place, they send their located information to the base station. Then the BS, by using this information, calculates kopt. Nodes are clustered using ICA and the clusters are formed. BS broadcasts this information to all nodes. Location of nodes is given to the ICA as input parameters. In this case, ﬁnding the kopt point as the center of cluster is the objective. In so doing, sum of square distance of each cluster members to center of cluster, plus sum of square distance of center of clusters to BS, are minimized. 4.2  
   
  CH Selection Phase  
   
  Unlike the pervious phase which is performed only once in the BS, this phase is repeated in each round. After clusters are formed in the BS and cluster information is broadcasted to all the nodes, each node will realize who belongs to which cluster. Each node sends a message to its neighbors which are in the range of its transmission and thereby will inform its ID and cluster number. Each node receives its neighbor’s message, saves it in the table information of nodes which have similar cluster number to it. Then this table is sent to other cluster members. Using this table, every member node, can update its tables, thus all cluster members are identiﬁed. Most energy is consumed in transmission and transmission distance has direct and exponential direct in energy consumption. Center of cluster is center of gravity, too, for this reason if CH located around center of gravity, distance between all cluster members to CH will be approximately equal, hence energy consumption in transfer of data, will be almost same for all nodes. This causes better balance energy consumption of nodes and prevents preterm death. If CH is located around the center of gravity, it is optimized, however this condition is not sufﬁcient for cluster head selection. As the numbers of nodes that are located around center, are limited, and if it was the only criterion, the energy of nodes adjacent to center is quickly ﬁnished and nodes will die soon. As a result, load balancing and energy balancing is destroyed. Hence, there are other criteria for selecting cluster heads. CHs consume more energy than member nodes, therefore the remaining energy of nodes must be noted in CH selection. Nodes which have more residual energy have higher priority than those which have less residual energy. Accordingly, in choosing CH, remained energy should be considered. Other criteria that are involved in selecting CH, is the distance between node and BS. The closer to the BS the CHs are placed, the lesser the energy used to transfer data. If this does not happen, the node that play role of CH, is remained as its role until its energy is ﬁnished end and node dies. This causes CHs to die sooner than members and the network balancing energy to be destroyed. The optimal status is when energy of all nodes is ﬁnished at the same time. Though, if the role of CH don’t replace, it will not happen.

  Steady up Phase  
   
  This phase starts after CH selection phase and repeat in each round. To avoid collision and energy efﬁciency, TDMA scheduling is run and a time slot is allocated for each member node so that it can send its data to CH. To avoid wasting energy, the rest of time, they are inactive. CH receives data from all cluster members, then aggregate received data and send them to BS. When all CHs send their aggregated data to BS, the round is ﬁnished. Model of energy consumption is the same energy model proposed in [8] in order to achieve an acceptable. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in transmitting an L bit message over a distance d, energy expanded by the radio is given by:  ETX ðL; d Þ ¼

  ð3Þ  
   
  Where Eelec is the energy dissipated per bit to run the transmitter or the receiver circuit, efs and emp depend on the transmitter ampliﬁer model we use, and d the distance between the sender and the receiver. By equating the two expressions at d = d0, we have rﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ efs d¼ emp

  5 Simulation Result For simulation of this algorithm, we have selected a rectangle area where 100 nodes are randomly distributed in the 100  100 area. The base station is located at the center (50, 50). The simulation is done with MATLAB. The parameters of simulation are listed in Table 1. Table 1.

  In this simulation we suppose a network with assumptions as follows: • • • • •  
   
  All nodes are located randomly. All nodes are static and have limited energy. At the beginning energy of all nodes are the same. All nodes are aware of their position and their amount of remaining energy. All nodes can be both Cluster head and normal node.  
   
  For clustering of nodes, the ﬁrst step is the calculating the optimal number of clusters. According to [8] and simulation parameters, it will be 75 m < dtoBS < 185 m. Therefore it is expected that the optimal number of clusters be in the range 1–6. Figures 2 and 3 show that by increasing the number of clusters, the average residual energy of the network is increased, death of nodes is delayed and network lifetime is

  increased. In this experiment the optimal number of clusters is considered 6. ICA divides the network into 6 clusters so that the total distance of each cluster member to cluster center and the total distance from all cluster heads to the base station, is minimized. Figure 4 shows the formation of nodes in 6 clusters. Circles same in color are same cluster members and squares indicate center of each cluster (Fig. 5).

  In this protocol, one of the cluster head selection parameter is proximity to the cluster center. The closer the nodes are to the center, the more their chance of being a cluster head is. Therefore the nearest nodes to center are the ﬁrst priority to become cluster heads.

  Figures 6 and 7 show in ICA, regardless of the percentage of nodes that are dead in early rounds, the remaining nodes almost die at the same time. As shown in Fig. 8, in early rounds ICA-Clustering have lesser average remaining energy than other algorithms. The reason is that some percentage of nodes die very quickly, but in other rounds ICA-Clustering have more remaining energy in each round and therefore the lifetime is improved than the others. ICA-Clustering is compared to

  6 Conclusion Wireless Sensor Network consists of a large number of tiny nodes that are distributed in the environment for speciﬁc purposes. Sensor nodes have limited energy and cannot be recharged. Algorithms used in WSN must both be energy efﬁcient and improve network lifetime. Clustering is one of the approaches that is used for energy efﬁciency. In this paper we introduce a new ﬁxed-clustering algorithm named ICA-Clustering. In this algorithm nodes are clustered with ICA in base station and then in those cluster nodes which are closer to the center of the cluster and have more residual energy. This improves its chance of being a cluster head. This algorithm, compared with other proposed clustering algorithms, leads to more energy efﬁciency and improves network lifetime.

  Abstract. Oil tanks monitoring is an important problem in the ﬁeld of oil production. Tanks might be distributed in large areas and dedicated people might be assigned for each tank to monitor it in terms of its temperature, the surrounding area, and even the level of oil inside. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) could be one of the best solutions to this problem. The problem of these tanks is that they are far from each other and they might have obstacles among them that block the sensors’ signals. At the same time, WSN consists of many low-cost nodes with limited power and communication. In addition, these sensors are either randomly deployed in the monitored ﬁeld or deterministically installed in speciﬁc places. In both cases, gaps may appear in the network leaving uncovered areas/tanks. In this paper it is improved the connectivity of the network used for oil tanks monitoring by adding minimum number of relay nodes to it. To solve the problem of oil tanks monitoring by using WSN are used the following algorithms: the Divided Network Area Algorithm (DNAA) by dividing the network area to small squares and connecting theses small areas; the Best Path Algorithm (BPA) by making the network connected when selecting the best path for all sensors and guarantee that all nodes are connected; and the Adjustable Communication Range with Best Path Algorithm (ACR-BPA) working with both the communication ranges and the network paths. With diﬀerent problem settings, the proposed algorithms are examined and compared to a state-of-art greedy algorithm.

  Introduction  
   
  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are taking huge attention due to its wide range of application in the last few years. Some of these applications are air pollution monitoring, health care monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, Oil & Gas Remote Monitoring applications for example pipeline monitoring [9] and tank level monitoring [10], etc. WSN consists of large number of wireless sensor nodes, which are deployed in particular area to measure certain phenomenon such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. These sensors send their measured data to a central processing unit, which collects all the data and develops the decision. Each sensor has its sensing rang, communication rang and limited power. Sensing rank is the monitored area around the sensor. Communication rank is the minimum distance between two sensors to send the data between them. c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E. Balas et al.

  Due to the limitations of the wireless sensors prolonging their lifetime becomes the important attribute in WSN. Another problem in WSN is the gaps between sensors due to the random deployment of the sensors. Random deployment of sensor nodes most of the time makes WSN disconnected. To solve this problem we need to add some relay nodes to the network to make it connected. In order to achieve better communication and maximize the network lifetime, relay nodes are deployed in the network using an eﬃcient deployment algorithm. One of the most important applications of WSNs is monitoring oil tanks. Oil tanks are containers available in many shapes: vertical and horizontal cylinder; open top, close top and ﬂat bottom. Sensors could be deployed in/on the tanks to measure certain features such as tank’s temperature, oil level, and surrounding environment. However, with large number of tanks, the connectivity of these sensors might be a problem. To solve this problem we need to deploy a minimum number of relay nodes on the disconnected areas in the network to make the network connected. At the same time, WSN lifetime is another issue that has to be considered during the relay deployment which makes the problem more complex. The paper presents three algorithms to solve the monitoring oil tanks problem. The ﬁrst algorithm, entitled Divided Network Area Algorithm (DNAA), in which it divides the network area into grid of cells, could be in a form of squares. Relay nodes will be added to the center of these cells for their purpose is to enhance sensors connectivity. The second algorithm, entitled Best Path Algorithm (BPA), exploits the concept of best path to the centralized node (sink node/base station). It computes the best path for each sensor node and tries to add the relay nodes on these paths. The last algorithm is named Adjustable Communication range with Best Path Algorithm (ACR-BPA). This algorithm is a modiﬁcation to BPA with the use of one of the sensors features which is the adjustable communications ranges. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 states some of the most related work to the work done in this paper. Section 3 presents the problem deﬁnition. The algorithms involved to solve the oil monitoring problem are shown in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the simulation and the comparison of the algorithms. Conclusion of the paper and the future work is presented in the ﬁnal section.

  Related Work  
   
  The scientiﬁc literature includes papers that consider the connectivity and the energy consumption in WSNs [1–6]. In [1], the authors considered deploying of few additional nodes possible to reconnect a disconnected network. In [2,7], the main goal is to fully enhance the connectivity of the wireless sensor networks by adding an available set of relay nodes to the network after going through some stages called levels. In the ﬁrst level, the authors divided the network area into certain numbers of equal regions and represented each region by a relay in its center. In the

  second level, the best K relays’ locations are chosen by solving a semi-deﬁnite programming (SDP) optimization. Through the third level, it iteratively reﬁnes the solution by dividing each obtained relay’s region into a number of smaller regions and repeating the same procedure. In [3], a relay sensor placement algorithm to maintain the connectivity is proposed. They formulated this problem into a network optimization problem, named Steiner Minimum Tree with Minimum Number of Steiner Point (SMT-MSP). This study restricts the transmission power of each sensor to smallest value, then add relay nodes to guarantee the connectivity. In [4], three heuristic algorithms are proposed for achieving connectivity of a randomly deployment ad hoc wireless networks. This work connects the network with minimum number of relay nodes with maximum utility from a given number of the additional nodes for the disconnected network. Another work proposed in [6] where the authors studied single-tiered constrained relay node placement problems, under both the connectivity requirement and the survivability requirement. In this paper, we study relay node deployment problem in WSN. Oil tanks monitoring is considered as a realistic case study application. In oil tank problem we need to make all sensors on each tank connected to the base station by adding minimum number of relay nodes in the optimal places to prolong the network lifetime.

  Oil Tanks Monitoring Problem  
   
  The Oil & Gas industry is one of the most prevalent industries for the application of Wireless Sensor Technology. WSN solutions for the oil, gas and power generation reducing maintenance costs, lowering the energy consumption, minimizing downtime, improving equipment performance, enhancing safety and centralize controls. Wireless technology has the potential to be beneﬁcial in many regards. Eliminating the need for cables can contribute to reduced installation and operating costs; it enables installations in remote areas and it allows for cost eﬃcient. Examples on Oil & Gas Remote Monitoring applications are Pipeline Integrity Monitoring and Tank Level Monitoring. In this paper, we focus on Tank Level Monitoring problem using WSN. Oil tanks are containers holding oil with open top, close top and Oil Pumping Units (OPU). Most of the Oil Pumping Units (OPU) are manually monitored (Fig. 1). This oil-pumping system use a high power-consuming process and is incapable of OPU’s structural health monitoring. In Tank Level Monitoring with WSN, the condition of the oil storage tanks can be monitored using sensors: level sensor, temperature sensor and gas sensor. These sensors are ﬁxed inside the oil storage tanks. The sensor output is given to the sink node. Based on the condition of the oil storage tanks and the oil pumping motor is controlled. The motivations of using WSN in Tank Level Monitoring are: the special nature of oil exploration (the majority of oil pumping units are spread over barren hills, mountains and deserts) and the existing oil-pumping systems with manual control.

  Manual control systems have three disadvantages: (1) The OPU administrator must go to the oil ﬁeld frequently to see the OPU status regardless the weather and the place. (2) Power consumption for OPU is huge during the oilpumping process. (3) It is hard to ﬁx the monitoring problem because it depends on people. For these reasons, WSN is used to monitor oil tank levels. Let consider a wireless sensor network in a two dimension space. All sensor nodes (terminal nodes) need to send all information about oil level on a certain tank to a sink node. The connectivity of these sensors depends on the position of the sensors and their communication ranges. As can be seen in Fig. 2, as an example, all sensors need to send all data to the Sink Node (SN). Sensor S2 can send to SN without a problem because S2 is directly connected to SN but for sensor S1, some relay nodes need to be added for the purpose of connectivity. Therefore, the work in this paper is step towards solving this problem using minimum number of relay nodes and saving the overall network lifetime.

  Algorithms for Solving the Oil Tanks Monitoring Problem  
   
  In this section, three algorithms are proposed to solve the oil tanks monitoring problem. The algorithms try to add some relay nodes to the WSN to make it connected with minimum number of relay nodes and try to prolong the network lifetime as well. The algorithms are: Divided Network Area Algorithm (DNAA), Best Path Algorithm (BPA) and Best Path Algorithm with Ant Colony Optimization (BPA-ACO). The following subsection introduces the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm that will be further used in the BPA-ACO algorithm.

  Ant Colony Optimization  
   
  Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a class of algorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm, Ant System, was initially proposed by Colorni, Dorigo and Maniezzo [11–13]. The base of ACO is to simulate the real behavior of ants in nature. The ant colony provides indirect communication with the help of ant’s pheromone. Pheromones are chemical substances which attract other ants searching for food. The attractiveness of a given path depends on the quantity of pheromones detected by an ant. The quantity of pheromone is governed by some rules and depends on the attractiveness of the route. The use of attractive route ensures that the ant exudes more pheromones on its way back and so that the path is much attractive for other ants. The evaporation of pheromones is time dependent. When the way is no longer used, pheromones are evaporated and the ants begin to use other paths. ACO steps are as follows. First Step: For ﬁrst sensor, martiﬁcial ant start with random number from 1 to maximum number of communication levels (in this paper there are 6 levels). Second Step: Each ant builds a solution by adding one communication level after the other until it reaches the last sensor. The selection of the next communication range depends on certain probability. The probability pik of transition of a virtual ant from the node i to the node k is given by formula 1; τi - indicates the attractiveness of transition in the past, ηi - adds to transition attractiveness for ants, ni- set of nodes connected to point i, without the last visited point before i, β, α- system dependent parameters. (η α + τiβ ) pik =  i β (ηni α + τni )  
   
  (1)  
   
  Third Step: Pheromone update, virtual ant is using the same reverse path as the path to the food source based on its internal memory, but in opposite order and without cycles. After elimination of the cycles, the ant puts the pheromone on the edges of reverse path according to formula (2); τij (t) is the value of pheromone in step t, Δτ is the value by ants saved pheromones in step t. Values Δτ can be constant or they can be changed depends on solution quality. τij (t + 1) = ρτij (t) + Δτ (t)  
   
  (2)  
   
  Fourth Step: At last, the pheromones on the edges are evaporated. The evaporation helps to ﬁnd the shortest path and provides that no other path will be assessed as the shortest as given in Eq. (3); ρ is a user-deﬁned parameter called evaporation coeﬃcient. (3) τij (t + 1) = (1 − ρ)τij (t) In our problem, a group of artiﬁcial ants searches solutions by starting each ant with random communication level for ﬁrst sensor and completing the path until last one ﬁnishes depending on certain probability. This operation is inspired from the Theorem 1 given in [8]:

  Theorem 1. To maximize the lifetime of the WSN, for the sensor nodes Ni and Nj, the power level assignment should satisfy xi ≥ xj for i < j. The high communication range is given high probability when the sensor is far away from the sink node and low probability is given to the nearest sensor to the sink node. When all ants reach to the end of the path, the pheromone gets updated depending on the path length and the consumed power. Therefore, the path covering the pipe with law power consumption has high pheromone value. ACO will stop after reaches the maximum number of iterations and returns the best path. 4.2  
   
  Greedy Algorithm  
   
  In [8] is solved the oil tanks monitoring problem using the Greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm starts with certain number of sensor nodes are deployed with certain position (the position of sensor nodes are on the top of oil tanks). The greedy algorithm includes the following three phases: Initial Graph Phase: Find the initial graph G(Nt , E(Lt , Rt )) where Nt is the terminal nodes with location Lt and communication range Rt . When the distance between two sensors is less than the communication range, the two sensors are connecting. In this phase, no relay nodes are added. Constructing Delaunay Phase: Construct Delaunay by using the terminal nodes. The construction of the Delaunay is illustrated as follows. Let S be the set of the points in the two dimension space. The Voronoi diagram of S, denoted as Vol(S) which is decomposed into Voronoi cells {Va: a ∈ S} deﬁned as: V a = {x ∈ R2 : |x − a| ≤ |x − b|, ∀b ∈ S}. The dual of the Voronoi diagram is the Delaunay triangulation Del (S ). Del (S ) is geometrically realized as a triangulation of the convex hull of S. After constructing Delaunay, the algorithm calculates the length of the three edges of each triangle. If the length of the edge is not larger than the transmission range Rt, then connect it. Triangle Type Phase: After Phase 1, the algorithm divides the Delaunay triangles into three types. In Type 1, the length of all edges of the triangle is larger than Rt and smaller than 2Rt. In Type 2, the longest edge of the triangle is at most 4Rt, while the shortest edge is larger than Rt and at most 2Rt. The properties of triangles diﬀerent from Types 1 and 2 are deﬁned as Type 3. For the triangles of Type 1. The algorithm places one relay node to connect ﬁve nodes that are formed by three adjacent triangles. Second, it places one relay node to connect four nodes that are formed by two adjacent triangles. Third, it adds one relay node to connect three nodes of one triangle. For the triangles of Type 2, it tries to place two relay nodes to connect three nodes of one triangle. For the triangles of Type 3, it adds relay nodes to connect the nearest disconnected nodes pair along the edge of the triangle. See [8] for other details on the greedy algorithm.

  Divided Network Area Algorithm  
   
  The Divided Network Area Algorithm (DNAA) starts with a certain number of sensor nodes (N ) deployed on the top of the oil tanks. All sensor nodes start with the same communication level Rt and the same power level. Sensor nodes assume to send its own data about the oil level, temperature, pressure, and any other features from the oil tank to the ink node (SN). DNAA includes the following phases: Dividing Area Phase: Divide the network area to squares with edges equal to the communication rang Rt . On each square which include at least one sensor, add one relay node at the center of it. DNAA didn’t add any relay nodes in squares without sensor nodes. Each two sensors with distance less than Rt are connected. In Fig. 2 are ten sensors. Assume sensor number 1, s1, is the sink node. All sensors need to send the data to s1. After DNAA had divided the area to squares, it adds relay nodes at the center of each square that has at least one sensor in it, see s12, s13, s15, etc. then, it draws a line (line with dark blue) between the two sensors that have distance d between them where d ≤ Rt (s12 and s3). Connecting Sensor Nodes Phase: Make the disconnected node connected with the nearest node with adding relay nodes like sensor number 6 in Fig. 3 or without relay node if the distance between the two sensors is less than Rt . For instance, from Fig. 2, to connect s1 with s2 DNAA adds a relay node s18 and the same for s6 and s15, it adds s19. Relay Nodes Connected Phase: Make the main relay nodes (relay nodes added in the center of the square) connected by adding other relay node(s) on the shortest path between the two of them as shown in Fig. 3. All of the sub-graphs need to be connected (Fig. 3). DNAA connects subgraphs: s1, s2, s11, s18 with sub-graphs: s13, s14, s4, s5 and some relay nodes s20:s23. Repeat this phase until all of the sub-graphs are connected.

  Best Path Algorithm  
   
  BPA starts with the same conditions for greedy algorithm and DNAA. It starts with a certain number of sensor nodes (N) are deployed on the top of the oil tanks. All sensor nodes are assumed to have the same communication rang Rt and the same power level. Sink node collect all data from all sensor nodes in the WSN. The BPA consist of the following phases. Connection Without Relay Node Phase: In this phase, each two sensors with distance less than Rt are assumed connected. Connection With Relay Node Phase: In this phase BPA adds relay nodes to make the network connected. BPA ﬁrst computes all paths from each sensor to the sink node. BPA calls the path as the best path if the number of relay nodes added to make the path connected was minimum number than others. To do this, BPA gives each link in the path a weight. The weight of a disconnected link is the needed number of relay nodes to make it connected. Every connected link has a weight equal to zero. The path weight is equal the sum of all links’ weight, see Fig. 4. As in Fig. 4, all sensors need to send its data the sink node (s1 is the sink node in this example). The links with green color mean that the two sensor are connected (the distance between them is less than Rt ) with weight w = 0. Links with red color means that the distance between the two sensors is greater than Rt ; in this case, the algorithm must add some relay nodes to make the link connected. Links with w = 3 means that they need three relay nodes to the link connected. For instance, sensor 4 can send its data to the sink node through many paths. For example, Path 1 goes through nodes 4, 9, 2, and 1 with weight = weightlink (4:9) + weightlink (9:2) + weightlink (2:1) which is equal to 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. Path 2 goes through nodes 4, 3, and 1 with weight equals to 0+3 =3. Sensor 4 will send its data through path 1 because it has the minimum weight. In the next step link (4:9) will be with w = 0 because it will be connected. The algorithm will repeat step two until all sensors will be connected.

  Adjustable Communication Rang with Best Path Algorithm  
   
  ACR-BPA assumes sensors with adjustable communication range R1, R2 . . . R6 as in [8] instead of using one communication range. The algorithm starts with a certain number of sensor nodes deployed on the top of oil tanks with certain positions. All sensor nodes are assumed to have the same communication power and adjustable communication range. In the ﬁrst step, the algorithm selects the best path for all sensors while the second step consists of two parts: Part A: Choose the communication range (RC) of the sensors depending on the distance between them. For example, in Fig. 4, if the distance d between two sensors is less than or equal to R6 (the maximum communication range), ACRBP doesn’t add any relay node. When: R5 < d ≤ R6, RC for the two sensors is R6; R4 < d ≤ R5, RC for the two sensors is R5 . . . d ≤ R1, RC for the two sensors is R1. Part B: Add the relay nodes to the link when d > Rmax. To deploy relay nodes in this step ACR-BP uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) deployment algorithm.

  Numerical Experiments and Discussions  
   
  In this section, the results for using WSN in Level Tank Monitoring problem will be illustrated. The next subsections show the eﬀect of using the proposed algorithms on the network lifetime in case of diﬀerent network settings. Experiment 1: Comparison among the four algorithms in terms the required numbers of relay nodes. In this experiment, there are certain number of oil tanks are established randomly on square area with length L, L = 100 m. One sensor node is deployed on the top of each tank. The experiment studies the eﬀect of using the four algorithms to make the wireless sensor nodes connected.

  The wireless sensor nodes, n, (where n is the number of oil tanks) changes from n = 10 to n = 100 sensors. All sensors as assumed to have the same power level. Sensors communication ranges as assumed the same for all algorithms except for ACR-BPA in which it utilizes diﬀerent communication ranges in its operation. From the results in Fig. 5, DNAA used the maximum number of relay nodes even more than greedy algorithm. ACR-BPA seems to be the best in terms of the required number of the relay nodes added for the network to be connected. ACR-BPA uses the minimum number of relay nodes compared with the rest of the algorithms. These results apply to all diﬀerent networks with diﬀerent number of nodes. Therefore, the algorithms could be ranked from the best to the worst in terms of the deployed number of relays as ACR-BPA, BPA, Greedy, and then DNAA. In fact, the implementation of DNAA on a real environment could be somehow diﬃcult due to the special nature of oil exploration and oil drilling, the majority of oil pumping units (OPU) are spread over barren hills, mountains and deserts. Experiment 2: Comparison among the proposed algorithms in terms of the required numbers with large monitored area. In this experiment, again the number of oil tanks are changed from 10 to 100; however, the monitored area in this set of experiments are considered as a square of side length L = 500 m. This large area certainly aﬀects the required number of relay nodes. Therefore, the purpose of this set of experiments is to examine the behavior of the proposed algorithms as well as the greedy algorithm. As can be seen in Fig. 5, DNAA still requires the maximum number of relay nodes; on the other hand, ACR-BPA used the minimum number of relay nodes. At the same time the behavior of the greedy algorithm and BPA is almost similar in terms of the number of the relay nodes they use. ACR-BPA enhances the results from Greedy algorithm with almost 23.2%, and BPA acts much better than the greedy algorithm with almost 0.009%.

  Experiment 3: Network lifetime under the operation of the proposed algorithms. In this set of experiments, we examine the performance of the proposed algorithms compared to the greedy algorithm in terms of network lifetime. The area of oil tanks is assumed a square shape L×L where L = 100 m. A sensor is deployed on the top of each oil tank. The term network lifetime mean, in this context, either the ﬁrst node dies or a relay nodes dies. The network lifetime is computed as the number of the round before any or both of these conditions occurs. As shown in Fig. 6, the number of oil tanks as well as the number of sensors change from 10 to a 100 on a square area of 100 × 100 m. Oil tanks are deployed randomly in all cases. The Fig. 6 shows that ACR-BPA gives the best lifetime over all of the other algorithms. For instance, at 60 oil tanks, the network still operated for 26 rounds. In addition, DNAA algorithm comes in the second rank after the ACR-BPA in which at 60 oil tanks, it keeps the network operate for 24 rounds. At the same time, BPA and the greedy algorithms have the same performance for almost 12 rounds with 50 oil tanks are deployed. The results is conﬁrmed in Fig. 6 even when the monitored area is increased to a square with side length L = 500 m. Experiment 4: Comparison among the proposed algorithms in terms of the required number of relay nodes and network lifetime with monitored area of equilateral triangle shape. Here the performance of the algorithms are examined when equilateral triangle area are used. The network topology in this case is assumed to diﬀer from the square monitored area. There is a certain number of oil tanks are established randomly on equilateral triangle area with edge L = 200 m. One sensor node is deployed on the top of each tank. The set of experiments illustrate the eﬀect of the network shape on the network lifetime and the number of relay nodes. The number of oil tanks increases from n = 10 tanks to n = 100. DNAA can’t implement in this experiment because it requires the monitored areas to be divided area into square shapes which is not valid in our case. From the results shown in Fig. 7, the change in the shape of the network area (oil tank area) causes a change in the required number of relay nodes and

  the network lifetime. However, ACR-BPA still over-performing other algorithms in terms of required number of relay nodes and network lifetime. At the same time, BPA and the greedy algorithm performing almost similar to each other especially with the large number of oil tanks. For instance after 60 oil tanks are deployed in the monitored ﬁeld, their curves are overlapping as can be seen in Fig. 7.

  Conclusion and Future Work  
   
  In this paper, the problem of oil tanks monitoring is solved using three proposed algorithms. The algorithms are compared to each other and with an existing greedy algorithm. ACR-BPA algorithm based on ACO seems to have the best performance over the compared ones. However, ACR-BPA is suitable only for nodes with multilevel communication ranges. Therefore, BPA could be suitable for nodes with ﬁxed communication range and ACR-BPA will be the best for network with nodes having variable communication range. The conducted extensive set of experiments show that the ACR-BPA and BPA are much better than the greedy algorithm in terms of the number of deployed relays and network lifetime. For our future work, we would like to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm on network with diﬀerent topologies and monitored areas with diﬀerent shapes. Acknowledgements.

  1 Introduction Priority base scheduling is always remains hot topic in the domain of operating systems. Printing Architecture (PA) is a major component of any Operating System. PA is consists on printer driver and the application which sends the prints to printer [1]. Operating system is the core of computer science and task scheduling is the major topic in this domain. Printer drivers are attached with spool simultaneous peripheral operations on-line used to add printing job to buffer. Spooling provides best behavior to such I/O which has different data rates in receiving and sending mechanisms. Spooler is a kind of queue which takes input from rear and out at front part of the queue. The spooler sends data to target printer’s I/O port which can be in serial, network, USB, wireless © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  communication channel and parallel [2]. In Priority base printing always higher priority given to those printings jobs which are processed more quickly rather than the lower priority base printings jobs. In this way low priority jobs are delayed again and again. In this research detail study is conducted regarding the scheduling algorithms in operating system. Priority base printings become bottlenecks who are assigned lowest priority. They may have to wait till their turn may be up to mid night in large departments. Every printing job has some operating to complete its printing processes. For e.g., user sends printing command from an application which include direct printing, networks printing and internet base printing, after sending a command from the application it enters to the spooler (Simulates Peripheral Operation online) [3]. It also allows the lowest priority base printing to print data. In this solution we are not going to ignore the highest printing jobs. The highest priority base printing jobs will be continued in the same way. Our main objective is to maintain a balance between the high priority and low priority printing jobs without suffering from continues delay. Now we are going to discuss a speciﬁc algorithm which can solve above issues in a smart way. A new method is proposed to solve the priority scheduling problems. This method is very handy for those users who are assigned a higher priority authority in printing mechanism [4]. It also allows the lowest priority base printing to print data. In this solution we are not going to ignore the highest printing jobs. The highest priority base printing jobs will be continued in the same way. Our main objective is to maintain a balance between the high priority and low priority printing jobs without suffering from continues delay. The spooler performs speciﬁc processing on the sent job and passes to the printer driver. The printer driver translates the job according to the bitmap of the printer. Printing job to local or remote computer is performed by printer provider. Printer provider is responsible for print queue, functions and Printing Priority Queue (PPQ) [5]. PPQ performs high priority job before the low priority for printing. We can set the priority of individual documents in the general tab, use the priority slider (Windows OS) low priority is 1 and highest priority is 99.  
   
  2 Related Works Priority queue is different from normal queue. The normal queue data structure is base on FIFO. But priority queue is a kind of box which receives different priority jobs and sent the highest priority out to the calling function. Here is a conceptual picture of a priority queue is shown in the Fig. 1. Figure 1 shows how that printing jobs are inserted in to the queue and the highest priority job is taken out at ﬁrst. It also shown that the lowest priority jobs are remained in the queue waiting for their turn. Printing jobs are sent to priority queue to sort their positions; different kinds of method are used for sorting their priorities just as array representation, link list representation and heap sort etc. [4]. All these data structure have computation time to sort the requested prints. If a printer is already working on hundreds request and so much busy and in that position while a printer is going to print documents at this position it may receive another request and it have to compute sort on all prints, and this situation may exists for long time. This can stop the working of all prints [6]. We can see before sorting priority queue jobs, this job can enter the priority

  queue in different order. After entering the jobs into priority queue an algorithm is applied to sort them. Absolutely this algorithm takes time to sort them. Figure 2 illustrates the before sorting view.  
   
  Fig. 2. Before sorting overview  
   
  Starvation can be caused in PPQ. Just e.g., there 1 to 99 priorities for users according to their work in a origination. 99 have the highest priority and 1 has the lowest priority in case of Microsoft OS. From 99 to let’s say 20 users are already in printing but remaining 19 to 1 may b in starvation. It can be from 1 to 19 has urgent information to give his boss but he is the victim of starvation. So just PPQ is not so better in such kinds of case for printing jobs. Figures 3 and 4 illustrates the priority Queue.

  Fig. 4. Priority queue enqueue and dequeue [13]  
   
  In Fig. 4 it is shown that enque and dequqe functions are takinf the highest priority job ﬁrst and then move to the lowest priority jobs. Assigning different priority level for different kinds of groups with high and low priority level of queue is applied to Microsoft Windows server edition [5]. According to Microsoft to use the best way of priority level printing, create multiple logical printer of the target printer. Each priority level should be different to other group of priority level. For example users in Group A should be able to connect with printer with highest priority just as priority number one. And Group no. 2 should access the printer with the priority level two and further so on [9, 10, 16]. The method printing not only support LAN but also the WAN in client systems [11]. This will become a huge network so we have to manage it in a smart way. The method of printing ﬁrst include to identify the server method to receive and print the jobs [16]. We can customize printing priority level for others groups. Click on start button and click on Open Printers and Faxes. Right click on target printer, click on selected printer Properties, and then choose Advanced tab. Now click on Priority tab, click the up or down arrows, and then click OK. Here you can set priority level from 1 to 99. “99” is the highest priority level and “1” is lowest priority level in printing [17]. Select the appropriate priority level and click OK. Now to add new logical printer so to add a new logical printer click on Add Printer to add another logical printer for the same existing physical printer. Now again we have to set its priority level according to our feet needs. Allow the low level users to use the ﬁrst logical printer and medium level users allow them to use second logical  
   
  220

  printer, following the way we set high level user for the highest logical printer. When we need to open Printer and Faxes dialog box, we have to click on start button and next click on Printer and Faxes [12].  
   
  3 Problem Statement Microsoft does not allow it to manage lowest priority jobs automatically. Microsoft Server provides manually setting to overcome this issue. In Microsoft environment we have to change the priority of documents which are waiting to get printer. Even the selected job’s priority changing does not affect other priority jobs, yet it is not a good solution for large business environments. It is also happen in Microsoft Server edition the lowest priority base printing is ﬁxed up to a ﬁx time of night. The lowest printing priority is selected at midnight for printings. The time setting is hard set so in time of free printer, the time set priority documents are not allowed to printer to use the printer resource. So this solution to the problem is not so much efﬁcient. Higher priority should in top ascending order numeric numbers and lower priority job should rear part of ascending order in numeric numbers.  
   
  4 Results and Discussions Queue is a linear data structure where an item is removed from top end (Front) and new item is inserted at back end (Rear). This is shown in the Fig. 5.  
   
  Fig. 5. Queue insertion and deletion  
   
  Figure 5 shows the insertion and deletion of the jobs in the queue box. This is a common fashion which is used in normal kind of queue and data structure. But we are going to use this queue data structure in a different way with the help of linked list. Linked list allow to add and remove a node in anywhere of the list. We don’t have to shift up and down of other part in linked list to remove or to add a node as in array data structure. Let’s suppose the following is a linked list queue. In above ﬁgure different priority numbers are shown in Fig. 6, let’s suppose these are the priority numbers of printing commands. And we need to send command of

  priority number two, which is recently entered into queue. But due to its priority we have to send it ﬁrst to printer. Here we need to remove this node from the linked list. Now we can see according to its data structure nature we should send command of top node to printer. We also not are going to sort it according to its priority, because we don’t want to use CPU cycle here due to efﬁciency issue. After removing the target node, now see in Fig. 7 [13].  
   
  Fig. 7. Target node removal  
   
  After knowing all kinds of issues in PPQ lets solve these issues in a smart way [14]. Before going in detail of our algorithm ﬁrst take overview the flow chart of our algorithm. This describes the working of algorithm in better understanding [15, 16]. 4.1  
   
  Proposed Methodology (Boss Algorithm)  
   
  Boss Algorithm is operating section of our algorithm. It should receive the print command before going to spooler. In standard scenario printing command works as [Application > Spooler > Printer]. But in BA this order should [Application > BA > Spooler > Printer]. When BA will receive a printing command from an application it should check the priority of the printing job. If the priority is one, it should directly send to Ready Priority Queue (RPQ). In other case if the sent priority print is not one it should send to Printing Priority Queue (PPQ) [17]. The Boss Algorithm is depicted in the Fig. 8. The pseudo code of the algorithm is given below. If (priority == 1) { Move to the RPQ Spooler Printing } Else { Move to PPQ RPQ Spooler Printing }

  4.2  
   
  Printing Priority Queue (PPQ)  
   
  PPQ should receive all kinds of prints which have not priority of one. Suppose we have following prints which are recently sent to PPQ. Before going in detail of PPQ, ﬁrst let discuss its structure. In Fig. 9 we can see the different prints have arrived in PPQ, different color boxes telling us the different prints in PPQ. Above white color numeric numbers are telling us the priority numbers which are 3, 5, 13, 8, 7 up to 9. Below numbers of the ﬁgure such as 0  001, 0  002 so on up to 0  00n. These numbers are addresses of the prints which are in PPQ in a link list point of view. PPQ data structure should program with link list. It is because we need add and delete operation, we know add and delete operations are much fast in link list against any other data structure. When a print enters into PPQ, its priority should be written and it address should also append with the print. Other words we can say that two kinds of information should have with every print. The Fig. 6 has different priorities without having the highest number priority [18]. When PPQ will receive a print having priority number 2, it should send before other prints to RPQ with the same priority number. We can see in Fig. 6 there is one print which has the priority number two. It should directly send to RPQ without further processing. It is because we also need a difference in RPQ which is receiving only priority number one. If we change the priority up to one in PPQ then it will be difﬁcult for RPQ which job should send to printer ﬁrst. So we should send print from PPR to RPQ in priority number two. When RPQ send command to printer which having the priority number two, RPQ should signal to PPQ I am serving your request and now you should rescan your printing jobs again. This process should do on each process which having the priorities number two in RPQ. PPQ is responsible for following processes.

  223  
   
  I. Send the print to RPQ which has priority number 2 without further processing. II. Increase the priority up to two, which has low priority than 2. III. After sending print to RPQ, PPQ is responsible to delete the node and join nodes. Now we take an example to understand PPQ. Now again see the following picture of Fig. 9.  
   
  Fig. 9. Prints arrival in the queue  
   
  After ﬁnishing all jobs which have the priority number 1, RPQ should signal to PPQ to send it printing jobs. So PPQ should send the priority number two printing job to RPQ, after it PPQ should delete the node after sending RPQ.  
   
  Fig. 10. Print job is sending to Ready Priority Queue  
   
  Figure 10 is showing that priority number 2 print job is sending to Ready Priority Queue (RPQ) without scanning and increasing priority number. After sending the print job, now PPQ should delete and join the sent printing job.

  Fig. 11. Delete and join node  
   
  Figure 11 is showing after sending, deleting and joining the node process. Next PPQ should wait and receive all prints commands while PPQ does not receive the signal of scanning. After scanning the signal of scanning PPQ should scan again all prints and increase the priority with number one, if there is again a printing command which the priority number two, it should directly send to RPQ without further processing. In Fig. 11 we can see there are two print commands which have priority number 3, mean on one scanning its priority should 2.  
   
  Fig. 12. Increasing the priority number  
   
  Now we can see the difference in Figs. 11 and 12 after scanning and increasing the priority number. Now we can see there are two prints commands which have priority level two. Now PPQ should send these two prints commands to RPQ, and after it PPQ should delete these nodes.

  Figure 13 is showing PPQ after deleting and joining two nodes. Now PPQ should again wait signal from RPQ for further scanning, increasing priority, sending print jobs, deleting and joining nodes. 4.3  
   
  Ready Priority Queue (RPQ)  
   
  RPQ should attach to spooler for sending prints commands to printer. RPQ should have two kinds of priority type prints number one, and number two. Priority prints which have priority one, should send to printer before the printing having the priority number two. RPQ can differentiate easily that which print should send to printer ﬁrst. When priority having number one should not in RPQ then priority two should send to printer for printing in batch sequence [19]. If printer is busy in priority two batch sequence and a new printing command inter in RPQ, after completing the prints of the under process printing then next turn should priority number one. When RPQ is working on priority number two, it should signal to PPQ for further scanning and increasing the priority which it has in its queue. This situation may happen there is one print RPQ and PPQ have many other prints jobs. There is no such priority exists which level increase to two for RPQ in just one scan. On empty queue of RPQ is should signal again and again to send print command to it. Now let’s take an example to understand RPQ.  
   
  Fig. 14. Two types of priorities are in RPQ  
   
  In Fig. 14 we can see two kinds of priorities are in RPQ, the priority number one came directly from BA after checking its priority. The priority number two is come from PPQ. This number of priority might be up to level two. In PPQ if the priority is two it should directly send to RPQ without increasing and extra processing over it.

  In Fig. 14 the right side command ﬁrst came into RPQ so it should send to spooler ﬁrst, second from the right side second last print command came into RPQ so it should send to spooler at position number two. Now next is priority number two which is in third number from right side. Because we have more prints which have priority number one, so the number two priority should not send to printer. The next print is also the priority number one which is at ﬁfth number from left to right in Fig. 14.  
   
  Fig. 15. Way of numbering  
   
  Figure 15 is showing us the way of numbering in which prints should send to spooler for printing. The new coming prints should treat in FCFS fashion if they have the same priority, the only difference is that priority number one and priority number two. On serving priority number two RPQ should signal to PPQ to rescan the priority numbers and increase the numbers according to its appropriate sequence. 4.4  
   
  Join Node (JN)  
   
  Join Node is sub program part of PPQ, JN should perform two kinds of work. It should ﬁrst remove the current sent print job node, after it, it should join the deleted node left and right nodes.

  Figure 16 is showing a complete picture of JN, JN should work Delete and Join Node. When a print should send to RPQ, PPQ should call next Join Node function. The ﬁrst part of the Join Node should delete the sent print command node, after deleting the node next JN should call its next function to join node [20]. While working in Deleting and joining the nodes PPQ should wait and not to scan the nodes. When JN return its control to PPQ, then PPQ should precede its next work.  
   
  5 Conclusion and Future Work BOSS algorithm is best way for printing all kinds of priority level. It provides turn to every level of priority and it also gives ﬁrst priority to the highest level priority users. It never let down or star-vat the low priority users. Low priority level users not have to wait their print in mid night. There is no need to add virtual printer and extra overhead for server and low priority level users. BA is complex in sense handling all kinds of priorities in same time. Change the priority of the queued jobs in every search setup the over head of CPU. In this way this proposed solution can be implemented in huighly demanded environment where printing capabilities are lacked. In future we are planning to implement this scenario in well developed organization and gain the beneﬁts of newly designed technique. This will be more beneﬁcial for the print and press industries to groom their business. This idea can be utilized for priority based process scheduling mechanism.

  Abstract. Ontology design patterns have been extended from software design patterns for knowledge acquirement in semantic web. The main concern of ontology design patterns is to how concepts, relations and axioms are established in a ontology using ontological elements. Ontology design pattern provide the solution of quality modeling for ontologies. In user prospective the presentation of ODP play a central role for the reusability of ontologies. This research determine the improvement areas in the presentation of content ODPs. Improvement in presentation can ultimately improve the understandability of a pattern from user perspective. Our objective is to analyze the template of different software engineering patterns (SEP) and ODP. On the basis of this analysis we suggest possible changes in current template and pattern presentation. It also includes determining the most important information about patterns which can help an ontology engineer in selecting an appropriate pattern. Presentation of design patterns is related to issues such as reuse, guidance and communication. Our main goal is to evaluate the current patterns presentation. The evaluation is focused on the analysis of current patterns. The ontology design pattern templates were compared with existing templates of other patterns for determine the improvement areas. The template of an ODP consists of many parts, the ﬁrst question is to identify the most important and vital information concerning the design patterns. This information would help an ontology engineer to select an appropriate design pattern for the required ontology. The second question is about the users who work with ontology design patterns. Generally, users are divided into two categories; novice and expert ontology engineers. Novice users are the end-users who use design patterns to implement in the ontologies. Expert ontology engineers are those who actually develop ontology design patterns. Each category of user has its own information requirement regarding design patterns.

  1 Introduction ODPs are semantic patterns that provide quality modeling solutions for ontologies. ODPs play an important role in learning and teaching ontology engineering [1]. They facilitate the automatic and semi-automatic ontologies construction and provide a base © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al. (eds.), Soft Computing Applications, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 633, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-62521-8_19

  for creating ontologies in different domains [2]. In user prospective the reusability of ontology depends on presentation of ODP. So far only a small catalogue of patterns exist which is available online at the ontology design pattern portal. In this portal, ODPs are described using a template with a set of headings that should be ﬁlled out when entering a new pattern. The template deﬁnes a standard way for constructing new patterns. There are possibilities to discuss modeling issues, review and suggest changes in patterns [4]. In computer and information science ontology is deﬁned as a “formal, explicit speciﬁcation of a shared conceptualization” [3]. One of the main problem areas is reusability of ontologies. The existing ontologies are available at online ontology repositories which provide guidelines to ontology users. Due to unfamiliar logical structure the existing ontologies provide limited support. Must be learned the good practices form literature. This problem is solved by implementing common solution as we learn in software engineering [4]. The patterns facilitate and to some extent automate the construction of ontologies. The development of patterns in the ontology ﬁeld is very popular as that in software engineering. The patterns are deﬁned for reuse and aim at facilitating the construction process very much like the way it is done in software engineering or architectural planning of buildings [5]. The purpose of design patterns is to solve the design problems. The patterns provide a useful way for handling the problems of reusability in a development process. In SE the common practices to build software through design and architecture patterns. This practice also follow in ontology engineering [2]. Ontology design patterns provide modeling solutions of ontologies design problems. They provide a base for creating ontologies in different domains. Patterns are also used for evaluation of ontologies [4]. Ontology design patterns (ODPs) are of several types. They are divided into 6 families; Content patterns, Structural Patterns, Presentation patterns, Correspondence Patterns, Lexico-Syntactic Patterns and Reasoning Patterns [6]. This thesis deals with the presentation of content ontology design pattern. It describes the design issues of the presentation of ontology design patterns. There may be certain information that an ontology user need to understand a pattern but it is not available in the description, our next task will be to examine the missing information in the current ontology design pattern templates. Finally, based on the results of above questions, we will made suggestions for the potential improvement in the current templates of ODP presentation.  
   
  2 Related Work Knowledge reuse is common way to improve the quality of work artifacts. Pattern is a common way to improve reusability. There are other ways to support reusability, i.e. in object oriented programming the concept of program components related to the reusability of design. To achieve reusability, number of design technique available in object oriented software development model for more reusable building block. An obstacle for reuse methodologies is the lack of motivation among developers. Before

  starting the process, the developer needs to establish a reuse library which requires extra efforts. Reuse process is divided in to two steps Design for reuse and Design by reuse. To expedite design by reuse, ﬁrst the design for reuse process must be established [5, 7]. Reusability is applied at different levels. In software engineering, reusability can be applied at following three levels [5]: Requirements Reuse: It deals with the models of the domain or the generic model of the requirement domain. Design Reuse: It deals with the models, data structures and algorithms. Software Component Reuse: It deals with reuse of software classes and editable source code. The development process of ontology is time consuming and more effort required form developer. Reuse of an ontology from an ontological engineering perspective can be hard. This is even more when there are large ontologies to be reused [8]. Ontology Library: For ontologies to be grouped and organized so that they may be reused further and for ontology integration, maintenance, mapping and versioning, an important tool known as ontology library systems was developed. These systems must fulﬁll all ontological reuse needs and must be easily accessible [9]. Ontology Matching: Ontology matching is a process of judging correspondence between semantically related ontologies, solving the problem of semantic heterogeneity and can be used in ontology merging, query answering, data translation etc. So ontology matching facilitates interoperability between matched ontologies [10]. A pattern is something re-occurring that can be applied from one time to another and also from one application to another. These concepts are in use in our daily life and also in our professional life. We use old solution as patterns. We search patterns in our surroundings that can be useful. In reuse the pattern are best practices that provide the good design [5, 11]. Currently in the computer science ﬁeld the most common and popular patterns are software patterns. Most of the software development projects, where applying functional or object oriented design are conducted using patterns. The patterns are used for increasing reusability, product quality and for managing complexity of the system development process. According to the phase of the development process where they are used these patterns are divided into different kinds [5]. The most common categories are the following: • • • •  
   
  Analysis Patterns [5, 12]. Architecture Patterns [5, 13]. Design Patterns (see [11, 14–17]). Programming Language Idioms (see [3, 13]).  
   
  232  
   
  Z. Ahmed et al.  
   
  Analysis patterns are used to describe the conceptual structures of business processes for the different types of business domains like how to transform these processes into software [3, 12, 18]. An overall structuring principle is used while constructing a viable software architecture. Architectural patterns are considered as templates for solid software architectures [3]. Design pattern describe the common solution of overall design problem in certain context through the depiction object and class communication. Design pattern provide the description of participation classes, their instance, their roles and interaction, distribution of responsibility. One object oriented design problem address by the certain design pattern that also provided sample code to describe the partial solution of the problem [14]. The lowest level of patterns is represented by idioms. The implementation of particular design issue is dealt with by the idioms. The aspects of both, the design and implementation, are treated by them [13]. 2.1  
   
  Problem Statement  
   
  The ontology design patterns (ODPs) have divided in grouped of six different families: Structural ODPs, Content ODPs, Reasoning ODPs, Presentation ODPs, Correspondence ODPs and Lexico Syntactic ODPs [6]. Graphically the types of patterns are represented as (Fig. 1):

  In this paper, our focus of research will be the Content ODPs. The comparison of ODPs is limited to software patterns and data model patterns because these are the most used and well known patterns. There are many ontology languages available for development but we will only focus on OWL ontologies [19].

  This research guide the improvement areas in the presentation of content ODPs. Improvement in presentation can ultimately improve the understandability of a pattern from user perspective. The focus of research is to analyze different content ODPs and provide some possible recommendation in current templates of the ODP presentation. It also includes determining the most important information about patterns which can help an ontology engineer in selecting an appropriate pattern. Presentation of design patterns is related to issues such as reuse, guidance and communication. Our main goal is to evaluate the current patterns presentation. The evaluation is focused on the analysis of current patterns. The template of an ontology design pattern consists of many parts, the ﬁrst question is to identify the most important and vital information concerning the design patterns. This information would help an ontology engineer to select an appropriate design pattern for the required ontology. The second question is about the users who work with ontology design patterns. There may be certain information that an ontology user need to understand a pattern but it is not available in the description, our next task will be to examine the missing information in the current ontology design pattern templates.  
   
  3 Methodologies There are many types of patterns but we have limited our comparison to those of software engineering and data models patterns, since these are the well know and common use patterns. Software patterns have been compared to ontologies by Devedzic in one of his article [16] where the author argued that there is a signiﬁcant overlap between the two concepts and that it is the aim, while generality and practical usage of these concepts differ. The concepts of patterns and ontologies have some common goals, e.g. sharing and reusing of knowledge. Both these concepts necessitate hierarchies of concepts, relationships, vocabularies and constraints. Moreover, both of them can be seen as using an object-oriented paradigm [3]. First, we analyze what current templates exist in other ﬁelds and then compare them to ontology design pattern templates to analyze the difference. In our study, evaluation was done on the results of the evaluation of different patterns. Templates of the patterns were compared to identify the difference and similarities in their presentation. Each part of the templates was studied with respect to its objective and the content provided in that part [19]. A template of a pattern is a standard way of representing a pattern. In a broad sense, a pattern template has four important elements. These elements are: Name, Problem, Solution and Consequences [3, 11, 19]. The different kinds of pattern templates are given below with their description.

  pattern template Description Account Analysis Pattern The Account pattern keeps track of accounts of customers in institutions. These customers can perform transactions of different types against the accounts Consider a banking institution, where customers have accounts of different types, e.g., checking, savings, loan, mortgage, etc. For the convenience of their customers, the bank may have several branches or ofﬁces located in different places There are many institutions, e.g., banks, libraries, clubs, and others, that need to provide their customers or members with convenient ways to handle ﬁnancial obligations, charge meals, buy articles, reserve and use materials, etc. Without the concept of account users need to carry large amounts of cash, may have trouble reserving items to buy or borrow, and would have serious problems sending funds to remote places Start from class Account and add relevant entities; in this case customers, cards, and transactions. Build an institution hierarchy describing the branches of the institution and relate accounts to the branches Fig. 6 An example for Bank accounts is shown in Figure. The classes contained in the model include Bank, BranchOfﬁce, Account, CheckingAccount, Customer, BankCard, TransactionSet (TXSet), and Transaction, with their obvious meanings. Class TXSet collects all the transactions for a user on his account for a given period of time. There are, of course, other types of accounts Fig. 7 The following are examples of uses of this pattern: • Banks, where customers have ﬁnancial accounts of different types • Libraries, where patrons can borrow books and tapes • Manufacturing accounts, where materials are charged The pattern has the following advantages: • It is clear that this model provides an effective description of the needs and can be used to drive the design and implementation of the software system. Not using a similar model would result in code that is hard to extend and probably incorrect • One can easily add other use cases: freeze account and activate/deactivate account The liabilities of this pattern come from the fact that to limit the size of the pattern and to make it more generic we have left out: Different types of customers. Each variety of customers could be handled in a special way. Accountability pattern

  Description Agent as delegate Multiagent system architecture-deﬁnitional How should the role of a user be converted to an agent or agents in an agent based system while maintaining conﬁdentiality of user information? A user role carries out activities in a system where conﬁdentiality of user information is critical Goals: to achieve optimum performance and maximize gains by taking decisions based on outcome of activities carried out Responsibilities: the responsibilities of this role involve carrying out both non trivial operational tasks and making concluding decisions based on the execution of the tasks carried out. User speciﬁc information is used in making the decisions. However, the user information should not be included in the execution of the operational tasks for security and conﬁdentiality reasons This pattern describes an approach for translating a role into agents. It prescribes translating a complex user with sensitive data into two types of agents which are User Agent and Task Agents. The pattern speciﬁes the relationship and control that should exist between these two types of agents Know Uses section mentions the use of the pattern in various scenarios. It includes minimum two examples from different domains The interaction between the assistant agent and the task agents has to be analyzed, modeled and implemented Adaptation/Integration: a user role can be translated into more than one assistant agents depending on the complexity and volume of the user information and decision making process Agent as mediator

  Data Model Patterns  
   
  Data Model Patterns help modelers to develop quality models by standardizing common and well-tested solutions for reuse [3]. The objective of data model pattern is to explain a starting point for data modelers [23]. A data model pattern can be implemented by adding additional attribute to any entity in a model or by adding a new entity or a relationship to an existing model. David Hay presented a Universal Data Model in [24]. It is a theoretical model which explains the basic principles of a data model pattern. See Fig. 8:  
   
  Fig. 8. Universal data model [19, 23]  
   
  In [38], Hay mentioned conventions for building data models. These conventions are guidelines for creating new patterns. They help in establishing a framework which data modelers can follow to reuse data model patterns. The modeling conventions are divided into three levels; Syntactic Conventions, Positional Conventions and Semantic Conventions [19]. Syntactic Conventions: This is the ﬁrst type of conventions of modeling and deals with the symbols to be used. In the process of syntactic convention evaluation, the crucial point to remember is that there are two audiences in data modeling. The ﬁrst audience is that community of users which use the models and their descriptions for the verifying whether or not the environment and requirements are actually understood by the analysts. The set of systems designers is the second audience. They make use of the rules of business as implied by the models to be the basis on which their design of computer systems is based [25]. Positional Conventions: This is the second type of Data modeling convention and dictates how entities of a model are laid out. They are concerned with the organization of elements and the overall structure of a model [25]. Semantic Conventions: Semantic conventions are those conventions that address the question of how can the meaning of a model be conveyed. These conventions help to represent common business scenarios in a standard way [25].

  Template of Content Ontology Design Patterns  
   
  Ontology design patterns are similar to software design patterns. The core idea of describing software design patterns is to use a template and collect them by means of a catalogue. In order to describe ODPs we can use a similar approach as used in software engineering but the difference is that, the template used for the presentation has been optimize for the web and deﬁned in an OWL annotation schema. It is the same used on the semantic web portal http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org. This part contains a template of Content ODPs which is composed of the following information ﬁelds, deﬁned in the annotation schema [2, 5, 26] (Table 7):

  4 Study Analysis and Results The work starts with the literature review. Our ﬁrst task was to study the current patterns that exist in other ﬁelds and compare them to ontology design patterns’ templates to analyze the difference. 4.1  
   
  Comparison of Pattern Templates  
   
  The basic knowledge of problems is in software engineering modeled by conceptual models that are known as Analysis patterns. The patterns could be illustrated using a UML notation [3]. For Example the Analysis Pattern is implemented by using a UML Class diagram, Sequence Diagram and State Diagram which were described in section. Looking at an example of an analysis pattern, one can easily gauge the above relationship between ontologies and Software Patterns, and other patterns used in Computer Science. This similarity is evident even in, for example, graphical representations of an Analysis Pattern and an ontology pattern [3]. 4.2  
   
  Comparison of Templates of Software Patterns and Content ODPs  
   
  This comparison is between the templates of software patterns and content ontology design patterns. We have described the elements of both software pattern templates and content ODPs in this chapter in Sects. 3.1 to 3.5, which provide us with a good starting point for comparison. There are several types of software patterns that are available and several techniques to present them but we selected Analysis Patterns, Architecture Patterns and Design Patterns. The template of a pattern is a standard way of representing a pattern. In a broad sense, a pattern template has four essential elements. These elements are: Name, Problem, Solution and Consequences as describe in Sect. 3. This comparison is based on similarities and differences between the Content ODP template and software pattern templates. We compare each element of the ODP template with software pattern templates. Comparison is based on the names, content and the overall presentation of the template. The parts described in Table 9 are considered as basic parts of a pattern. The description of these parts is stated. The table shows how these basic parts are described in software patterns and ODP templates. Context: In Software Patterns, the section context describes the situations where the given pattern is applied. Every pattern has a context based on its application area. In content ODPS, context is deﬁned in the form of domains and scenarios where the pattern is applicable. Problem: For Analysis Patterns, Design Patterns and Architectural Patterns, the section Problem or Motivation describes the problem that can be solved by implementing these patterns. In analysis patterns, the section problem describes some generic use cases. In Design Patterns, some of the patterns use scenarios for giving more description of patterns. Such description should be able to clarify the details of the problem. In ODPs, the Problem is described by Competency Questions. Competency Questions consists of a list of competency questions expressed in natural language that

  are covered by the pattern. The section Competency Question describes the problem which is to be solved by the ODP. Competency questions are the requirements that an ontology should fulﬁll. Solution: In Analysis Patterns, Architecture Patterns and Design Patterns, the section Solution gives a fundamental solution principle to be used in the pattern for solving a problem. In Analysis Patterns, the solution is described by using UML diagram and also a brief description of different parts of the pattern is given. In Design Pattern, the sections structure, participants and collaboration describe the solution. The section Structure is a graphical representation of the classes in the pattern which use the notation of the object modeling technique (OMT). It also uses interaction diagrams to illustrate the sequence and collaboration between the objects. The section participants give a detailed description of the classes and objects and their responsibilities. The section collaboration describes how the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities. In Architecture pattern, the section solution gives the description, using text and a graphical representation, as to how we can achieve the intended goals and objectives. It also describes the variants and specializations of the solution. It gives the description of people and computing actors and their collaboration. In ODPs, the section solution consists of four parts: OWL Building Block, Elements, Solution description and Graphical Representation. The section Solution description describes how a given pattern can solve the problem in the context. The section OWL Building Block contains an OWL ontology with reusable classes and reusable properties. The section Elements briefly describes Classes and Properties of the pattern implementation and the role of these classes and properties within the ODP. The Graphical representation gives a visual presentation of the pattern classes and their relations. 5Consequence: In both software patterns and content ODPs, the section consequence describes the possible beneﬁts and limitations on the solution after using the pattern. What are the results of using the pattern? In some ODPs it is more about unexpected consequences and limitations.

  Example: For Analysis Patterns, Design Patterns and Architecture Patterns, the section Example gives the real world example, which shows the existence of problems and needs for the patterns. For Analysis Patterns and Design Patterns the section example consists of two parts. In the ﬁrst part the problem and in second part the implementation. In content ODPs, example is given in the form of a scenario and an example OWL ﬁle which is the OWL implementation of the scenario. Table 10 describes the common elements of the template of content ontology design patterns and software patterns (analysis patterns, design patterns and architecture patterns). These elements are described in the background chapter with details in Sect. 2.3.2. The section motivation of design pattern is similar to the section problem of other software patterns. In Table 10 the vertical line had different columns that shows the label of different pattern. The horizontal line shows the template heading and symbol X describes the presence of common element.

  The template of content ODPs has developed by following the template of software design patterns. The comparison of both patterns reveals that both patterns have a lot of similarities and the current template of content ODPs includes all the elements of software patterns except ‘forces’. Forces deﬁne constraints and problems that can affect the solution. In content ODPs, only the beneﬁts and/or possible trade-offs when using the ODPs on the initial problem are mentioned. Apart from the software patterns, the content ODPs has some additional parts which have been added according to the pattern requirements. Unique Sections: Content ODPs have some unique sections, which are not described in other Software Pattern Templates. These sections are: EXTRACTED FROM, REENGINEERING FROM and HAS COMPONENTS, as mentioned in the background chapter in Sect. 2.5. 4.3  
   
  Comparison of Data Model Patterns and Ontology Design Patterns  
   
  Data model patterns and ODPs are different to each other because data model patterns are presented only in graphical form while ODPs have much more detailed graphical and textual description. While content ODPs have an ofﬁcial catalogue where users can select from a list of patterns, there is no ofﬁcial catalogue for data model patterns.  
   
  248  
   
  Z. Ahmed et al.  
   
  The template of an ODP has a description of different parts of the pattern which is presented in the graphical and textual form. To implement an ODP, an ontology engineer has to study the description to understand a pattern. A data model pattern is presented in the form of an UML diagram. The diagram is built by following conventions which are a set of rules. These conventions standardize a data model hence makes it easier for a data modeler to reuse a pattern. The reusability of both patterns depends on different factors. Content ODPs can also be used directly as they are, just like data models, although they are usually specialized but this depends on their generality. In data model patterns, it is up to the data modeler to decide whether to use a real model to make some minor adjustments or to use a completely abstract model of a problem. The similarities of data model patterns and ODPs lie in the graphical representation of a problem. Also as we saw in Table 11, different parts of both patterns can be mapped to each other hence knowledge from data model patterns can be translated into ODPs. The use of conventions in data model patterns makes it easier to understand the diagram. These conventions and practices can be translated into guidelines for creating more uniform diagrammatic notations for ODPs. Table 11. Mapping of elements of data model pattern and ontology design pattern [19, 22] Data model pattern Entity Attribute Subtype/supertype Relationships Mutually exclusive sets  
   
  Ontology design pattern Concept Relation to “attribute” Subsumption hierarchy Relations Disjoint concepts  
   
  Overall, the comparison of software patterns and data model patterns with content ODPs shows that there are a lot of similarities in the templates of software patterns and content ODPs. The difference lies in the presentation of the content. The graphical representation of content ODPs can be made uniform by deﬁning conventions as it is done in data model patterns. In an experiment, the knowledge from data model patterns was translated into ontology design patterns by mapping the parts using the KAON tool [2]. Table 11 shows the mapping between the different parts. The above mapping shows that the knowledge stored in the data model patterns can be translated into ODPs. This knowledge can be reused to create new ODPs from existing data model patterns.  
   
  5 Conclusions The purpose of this study was to improve the presentation of content ontology design patterns. This research is part of an effort to solve the larger problem of engineering high quality ontologies. One possible solution to this problem is to introduce reuse in ontology engineering which can standardize the ontology development process and

  reduce the time and effort involved in it. ODPs are considered best practice to achieve this objective. To encourage the use of ODPs for ontology development, their presentation must be explicit and precise. Suggestions are based on the comparison of the different patterns with the ontology design patterns. Based on the literature review, we propose following improvements in the current template for content ODP: The Graphical Representation should have a more uniform diagrammatic notation. This can be done by deﬁning standards or conventions which ontology engineers can follow while creating patterns. As guidance, the conventions used in data model patterns can be studied to deﬁne similar conventions for content ODPs. Also, namespaces provided in the Graphical Representation section should be made explicit in the Additional Information section. Scenarios should be more explicit. While scenarios presented in the General Description section are simple, they can be more complex in general. Further, the scenario section should describe the binding from concrete elements to the pattern elements. At ODP portal, scenarios of several patterns are missing. They must be included in each pattern because they were considered as important parts. Software patterns include the implementation section with the solution of complex problem. Implementation help user to understand the pattern. This research is part of an effort to solve the larger problem of engineering high quality ontologies. One possible solution to this problem is to introduce reuse in ontology engineering which can standardize the ontology development process and reduce the time and effort involved in it. ODPs are considered best practice to achieve this objective. To encourage the use of ODPs for ontology development, their presentation must be explicit and precise.  
   
  6 Future Works This study will be improved through experiment. Determine how well the current ODP template supports the understanding and usage of Content ODPs. To get experts opinions on the current structure of the Ontology design pattern template. There may be certain information that an ontology user need to understand a pattern but it is not available in the description. This research will improve by examine the missing information in the current ontology design pattern templates.

  Abstract. Sorting algorithm remained hot topic in computer science from the birth of computer science to achieve maximum performance. Fortunately this achievement became possible due to good and fast sorting algorithms, such as heap sort, merge sort, radix sort and other sorting algorithms. Till this achievement is also under research to ﬁnd more efﬁcient algorithms. In sorting algorithm arrays and link list data structures are commonly used. We know arrays are efﬁcient if we need consecutive kind of data structure and link lists are useful when we need to add and remove items in the data structure. In other word we can say both data structures have own its merits and demerits. So in our sorting algorithm we are going to use both kinds of data structure. We will use in our MainIndex sorting algorithm arrays as the MainIndex and link list as sorting cells. MainIdex sorting algorithm need some kind of information just the length of the number which is going to sort and the value of the number which is going to sort in sorting cell. Keywords: MainIndex  Sorting cell  Selection sort  Link list  Merge sort  Bubble sort  Quick sort  
   
  1 Introduction A sorting algorithm exchanges the numbers in a speciﬁc order according to the ﬁt needs of the users. Any sorting algorithm has merging and searching functions. Some other exist which used the functions to sort the numbers [1]. The data is mostly taken from an array which is faster in sense of random access [2]. Link list provide a fast method when we need to add or delete node for numbers against arrays [3]. Sorting algorithms remain hot topic since the birth of computer due to time complexity. Time complexity is the total time required by an algorithm of the program to complete its given task [4]. The time complexity is measurement by big O notation of the algorithm. The numbers of elements are measured to compute the complexity time. Sorting algorithms are the fundamental concepts for a computer programmer, computer scientist and IT

  professionals [5]. When we search in database mostly used ORDER BY clause, using this query actually we are using the sorting algorithm. A common example is our phone book of address, we save our contact numbers in the mobile in a different order, but when we need to ﬁnd a contact they are listed into a sequence [6]. First look we should compare various sorting algorithms in dealing with large set of data, in large set of data some algorithms become very slow in practical use. Next look is about the memory usage of the algorithms, mostly faster algorithms takes large memory rather than slow one algorithm [7]. If we look about the progress in the memory usage of today, large memory is not main issue, but issue is faster algorithms [8]. But we even imagine which algorithm is fastest; the speed of the algorithm depends on the working and environment where the sorting is done. In sense which kind of data is being to sort? We cannot use the same algorithm for sorting 200 numbers on such kind of database which cannot ﬁt into memory, so such kinds of algorithms are designed in different ways.  
   
  2 Related Works Today many programming languages are providing built in functionalities which are usable for sorting numbers [9]. Java API, .Net framework and C++ all provides built-in sorting techniques [10]. For different kinds of data types such as floating numbers, integer number and characters need to sort according to the requirements. But sometime we need a generic kind of sorting algorithms for generic data structure [11]. This thing leads us to a complicated problem. But OOP provides us to solve such kinds of problems [12]. So many good algorithms are designed but no one algorism is Silver Bullet. At this point we see the complexity of ﬁve algorithms. As given in the Table 1.

  Bubble Sort  
   
  The bubble sort algorithm is a well-known sorting algorithm. Its belongs to O (n2) sorting algorithm. But bubble sort is not very efﬁcient for sorting of large amount of data, other hand it is stable and adaptive algorithm [13].  
   
  MainIndex Sorting Algorithm  
   
  255  
   
  Bubble Sort Algorithm for i = 1 to n; swapping = false for j = n: i+1; if a [j] < a [j-1]; swap a[j,j-1]; swapping = true; if not swapping; break; end 2.2  
   
  Insertion Sort  
   
  Insertion sort is elementary sorting algorithm and its time complexity in wore case is O(n2). Insertion Sort is a good choice when data is nearly related to each other due to adaptive algorithm. But it is not good when data size is small. Insertion Sort is recursive by nature when the problem size is small [14].  
   
  Insertion Sort Algorithm for i = 2 to n; for (k = i; j > 1 and a[j] < a[j-1]; j--); swap a[j,j-1]; end 2.3  
   
  Merge Sort  
   
  Merge sort bases on divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the problem into two parts and sorts them, after sorting them it merges them. Merge Sort is best choice for different kinds of environments for example when sorting with link list, stability and fast result is required. But it is expensive when the problem is in array [15]. 2.4  
   
  Heap Sort  
   
  Heap Sort algorithm bases on binary heap. In some sense it is similar to selection sort where we ﬁnd the maximum value in start and rearrange it at the end; we repeat the same process for remaining numbers in the problem [16]. 2.5  
   
  Quick Sort  
   
  Quick Sort also works in Divide and Conquer method just as Merge sort. It takes a number as pivot and make the partition according to the selected pivot. Selecting a pivot is grand work in this method. Different kinds of ways are to select the pivot. • Pick ﬁrst number as pivot. • Pick last number as pivot.  
   
  256  
   
  A. Ahmed et al.  
   
  • Pick random number as pivot. • Pick middle number as pivot [17].  
   
  3 Problem Statement We took an overview on different kinds of sorting algorithms and saw each algorithm is using a speciﬁc data structure such as arrays or link list. So every sorting algorithm has own its pros and cons, some need more memory but they are sharp in sorting the numbers, some algorithm needs less memory but it takes more time to sort the numbers. Different sorting algorithms take different time to sort the numbers. Every algorithm behaves different according to the nature of the problem. We are going to discuss speciﬁc method which behave constant in every nature of sorting data and takes less time against all sorting algorithms. In Main Index sorting algorithm we will use both kinds of data structure such as link list and arrays according to their efﬁcient point of view.  
   
  4 The Proposed Solution Now we are going to discuss a new sorting algorithm, we have following unsorted array. 32, 18, 45, 56, 22, 64, 8, 88, 67, 105, 77, 440, 11, 90, 16 We have these unsorted serials of numbers in array. To sort them in order ﬁrst of all we should compute the maximum length in unsorted numbers. We are not going to ﬁnd the maximum number in unsorted numbers. In our unsorted list 32 is the ﬁrst number, in this we need two kind of information number one the value of ﬁrst digit which is 3 in case of 32. Second we need the length of 32 which is 2. The length 2 numeric numbers should store in LIndex2. Later we will see what mean of LIndexN. Before going in detail of MainIndex ﬁrst we should take an over view of the sketch of the MainIndex. Following is the basic detail ﬁgure of the MainIndex. As shown in the Fig. 1.

  MainIndex  
   
  MainIndex has a array from 1 to 9, this section will use appropriate position according to the value of the number, let’s take 32 has example here again, 32 has ﬁrst digit 3 so it should enter in array of 3 in MainIndex. The arrow is a pointer which is pointing to LIndex1. LIndex1 mean length of index 1 which is core structure with the MainIndex. All those numeric numbers which have its length one those should store in this index. Other LIndexN should create when a numeric number has different length against already created LIndexN. But LIndex1 should create automatically when MainIndex starts. 4.2  
   
  LIndexN  
   
  L mean length of the numeric number which is going to store in the sorting sequence, N is index number. Every LIndexN has its own sorting cells which should program in link list; we need compression of existing numbers with the new coming number, after compression it should store in its appropriate place. Internal structure of sorting cells is as following. It is given in the Fig. 2.  

  B) then a signal with a single component is more likely to have a component only. Otherwise, the analyzed signal has more components. This statement is veriﬁed by the data available in Table 2. C. Information Measures Table 3 presents the numerical values of the absolute (RH) and differential Renyi entropies (DRH). The differential entropy is obtained by subtracting the entropy of the case #1 from the absolute values of all others entropies. Two distributions are considered, namely WVD and PWVD. Figure 7 shows a comparison between entropies, as solution describing the complexity of the analyzed signal, in all ten considered cases. It is important to notice the superiority of the entropies. If the complexity of the signal is growing (at least as the number of components) then the entropy is rising, too. Moreover, differential entropies

  are able to predict the number of the components in the analyzed signal, as it was described in Sect. 3B. The information obtained from entropies combined with the ratios of statistical parameters, as described above, could drastically improve the results of the signal analysis, both on qualitative (as number of components) and quantitative aspects (localization and width in time and frequency). D. Detection and Filtering of Interferences With reference to the system of Fig. 1, let TInxn be a block image for testing. Let bInxn (bad image) be the block image with artifacts and let NInxn (normal image) be the block image with no interferences. The masking decision is based on the decision rule: IF corrðTI; bIÞ ¼ max AND THEN FILTER TI  
   
  corrðTI; NIÞ ¼ min  
   
  ð24Þ  
   
  where corr(.,.) is the statistic correlation operator working on square matrices. Figure 8 presents four block images: two for clean (correct) images, x1 and x4, and two block images with interferences, x12 and x34. The interference images have two speciﬁc features, which could be used in automatic detection and classiﬁcation: (i) it contains a lot of parallel ellipses; (ii) The main diagonals are parallel to the segment which connects the centers of the closest neighbored components. This set of features could be used to distinguish the real from false components in time-frequency images. In this case, the self-checking procedure could be used before calling a classiﬁer for recognition purposes. Figure 9 presents the TFI for case # 8 and the results of the cross-correlation between the TFI and the bad block assigned to x12. The maximum cross-correlation indicates the position of the most similar block, which should be processed. Finally, Fig. 10 shows the effect of removing two bad blocks (block with interferences) from the raw time-frequency image (TFI), for the same case (#8).

  The complete set of experiments can ﬁx the performance of the system. The results are as expected for all cases with double components. For the cases with more components, the results depend on the distance between components. If some components are in the middle, between two or more components, then they are modiﬁed and the reconstruction becomes quite difﬁcult with this system.

  5 Conclusions A system meant to analyze, detect and ﬁlter artifacts in images coming from time-frequency transforms was considered and discussed, in the context of change detection and diagnosis of industrial equipment, which generates mechanical vibrations. The complexity of the input signal is well described by the Renyi entropy, which increases when the complexity of the analyzed signal is growing (number of components, mainly). The average parameters of time and frequency are good descriptors only for mono-components signals. Otherwise, they refer to the average content. The detection system uses the correlation between small (blocks) images and scanned input images. The raw time-frequency image is decomposed in basic (small) blocks of size nxn = 100  100. The decomposition could be static, by scanning the raw image on vertical and horizontal axis, in steps of one or several pixels, or could be dynamic, by changing the size of the scanning steps, based on the content of the image. Sparse blocks will generate higher scanning steps. The dynamic scanning speeds up the analysis of the image. The interference images have two speciﬁc features, which could be used in automatic detection and classiﬁcation: (i) it contains a lot of parallel ellipses; (ii) The main diagonals are parallel to the segment which connects the centers of the closest neighbored components. This set of features could be used to distinguish the real from false components in time-frequency images. The system needs a training stage (time) to complete a database with what means good and bad features in the analyzed images. This process is supervised and could be run all the time. The similarity checking between the content of the raw image and the selected features for database is made on cross-correlation basis. The performance of the system is acceptable for signals with well-separated components, in time and frequency, which is the case of many real faults in the industry of rotating machines. If the components and the artifacts interfere, the system cannot work as expected, and generates errors. It could be involved in estimating the values of the real components, but this aspect is not considered here.

  Abstract. Noise cancellation is the primary issue of the theory and practice of signal processing. The Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing and diﬀerentiation ﬁlter is a well studied simple and eﬃcient technique for noise eliminating problems. In spite of all, only few book on signal processing contain this method. The performance of the classical SGﬁlter depends on the appropriate setting of the windowlength and the polynomial degree. Thus, the main limitations of the performance of this ﬁlter are the most conspicious in processing of signals with high rate of change. In order to evade these deﬁciencies in this paper we present a new adaptive design to smooth signals based on the Savitzky-Golay algorithm. The here provided method ensures high precision noise removal by iterative multi-round smoothing. The signal approximated by linear regression lines and corrections are made in each step. Also, in each round the parameters are dynamically change due to the results of the previous smoothing. The applicability of this strategy has been validated by simulation results.

  Introduction  
   
  Many areas of signal processing require highly eﬃcient processing methods in order to achieve the desired precision of the result. In a particular class of tasks, for e.g. chemical spectroscopy, smoothing and diﬀerentiation is very signiﬁcant. An ample number of studies have been revealed the details of the smoothing ﬁlters. In 1964 a great eﬀort has been devoted to the study of Savitzky and Golay, in which they introduced a particular type of low-pass ﬁlter, the so-called digital smoothing polynomial ﬁlter (DISPO) or Savitzky-Golay (SG) ﬁlter [17]. c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E.

  The main advantage of the SG-ﬁlter in contrast to the classical ﬁlters - that require the characterzation and model of the noise process-, is that both the smoothed signal and the derivatives can be obtained by a simple calculation. Critical reviews and modiﬁcations of the original method can be read, for instance in [15,21]. The core of this algorithm is ﬁtting a low degree polynomial in least squares sense on the samples within a sliding window. The new smoothed value of the centerpoint obtained from convolution. There is a rapidly growing literature discussing the properties and improvements of SG ﬁlters [1,3,6,7,12,16,24,25]. Also the importance and applicability of a digital smoothing polynomial ﬁlter in chemometric algorithms are well established [8,11,22]. The frequency domain properties of SG-ﬁlters are addressed in [2,10,18,19]. In [14], the properties of the SG digital diﬀerentiator ﬁlters and also the issue of the choice of ﬁlter length are discussed. Paper [13] concerns the calculation of the ﬁlter coeﬃcients for even-numbered data. Also the fractional-order SG differentiators have been investigated, for e.g., by using the Riemann-Lioueville fractional order deﬁnition in the SG-ﬁlter. For instance, the fractional order derivative can be calculated of corrupted signals as published in [4]. There are several sources and types of noise that may distort the signal, for e.g., eletronic noise, electromagnetic and electrostatic noise, etc. [23]. In the theory of signal processing it is commonly assumed that the noise is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) process. However, in engineering practice often nonstationary, impulsive type disturbances, etc., can degrade the performance of the processing system. Since, for the noise removal issue of signals with a large spectral dynamic or with a high rate of change, the classical SG ﬁltering is an uneﬃcient method. Additionally, the performance depends on the appropriate selection of the polynomial order and the window length. The arbitrary selection of these parameters is diﬃculty for the users. Usually the Savitzky-Golay ﬁlters perform well by using a low order polynomial with long window length or low degree with short window. This latter case needs the repetition of the smoothing. It has also been declared that the performance decreases by applying low order polynomial on higher frequencies. Nonetheless, it is possible to further improve the eﬃciency. With this goal, in this work we introduce an adaptive smoothing approach based on the SG ﬁltering technique that ensures acceptable performance independent of the type of noise process.

  Mathematical Background of the Savitzky-Golay Filtering Technique  
   
  In this section we brieﬂy outline the premise behind the SavitzkyGolay ﬁltering according to [9]. Let us consider equally spaced input data of n{xj ; yj }, j = 1, . . . , n. The smoothed values derives from convolution, given by gi =

  where the window length M = 2m + 1, i = −m, . . . , λ, . . . , m, and λ denotes the index of the centerpoint. The k th order polynomial P can be written as P = a0 + a1 (x − xλ ) + a2 (x − xλ )2 + . . . + ak (x − xλ )k  
   
  (2)  
   
  The aim is to calculate the coeﬃcients of Eq. (2) by minimizing the ﬁtting error in the least squares sense. The Jacobian matrix is as follows J=  
   
  ∂P ∂a  
   
  (3)  
   
  The polynomial at x = xλ is a0 , hence in order to evaluate the polynomial in the window we have to solve a system of M equations which can be written in matrix form J ·a=y (4) ⎞ ⎞ ⎛a ⎞ ⎛y 0 λ−m 1 (xλ−m − xλ ) · · · (xλ−m − xλ )k .. ⎟ ⎜ .. ⎟ ⎜ .. ⎟ ⎜ .. .. .. ⎜ ⎟ . ⎟ ⎜. ⎟ ⎜ . . . ⎟ ⎜ . ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎟ . . ⎜1 ⎟×⎜ . ⎟=⎜ . ⎟ 0 ··· 0 ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ . ⎟ ⎜ . ⎟ ⎜. ⎟ ⎜ . ⎟ ⎜ . ⎟ .. .. .. ⎝ .. ⎠ ⎝ . ⎠ ⎝ . ⎟ . . . . . ⎠ k 1 (xλ+m − xλ ) · · · (xλ+m − xλ ) ak yλ+m ⎛  
   
  The coeﬃcients are found from the normal equation in the following writing

  Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of the classical SG-ﬁlter. It can be observed that the smoothing is not precise. To overcome this problem, the following section will present an adaptive strategy (Table 1).

  Adaptive Multi-round Smoothing Based-On the SG Filtering Technique Multi-round Smoothing and Correction  
   
  This new adaptive strategy aims setting automatically the suitable polynomial order and window length at the diﬀerent frequency components of the signal. Hence, it is possible to avoid the undershoots and preserve the peaks that could be important from diﬀerent data analysis aspects. Since we perform in the time domain, this method provides eﬃcient results independent of the type of contaminating noise. At ﬁrst, the classical Savitzky-Golay ﬁltering is performed. Assuming that only the corrupted signal is available, this step serves for revealing the peaks, hence the window length and degree of the polynomial may be arbitrary. After the ﬁrst smoothing, the coordinates of the local minimum and maximum points can be obtained. From now on, we can also deﬁne the d distace vector which contains the number of samples between two neighboring points  
   
  450

  of local minima and maxima. Then, the next step is the separation of the highand low frequency components using the bordering points and setting the proper parameters for the smoothing. The window should match the scale of the signal and the polynomial degree should vary by depending on the framesize and frequency. Since the next fuzzy relation can be deﬁned between the section length; F (dmax >> d¯R ) =  
   
  1 1+  
   
  e−(δmax −d¯R )  
   
  ∈ [0, 1]  
   
  (10)  
   
  where δ¯R stands for the average length of the sections in the current R parts of the signal, while δmax = max(d) in the observed signal. If g(dmax , d¯R ) = 1, the current part of the signal contains high freqency componenst. Hence, the following rules are applied: if 1 > g(dmax , d¯R ) > 0.9 then k = 5, M = nint(0.3δ¯R ) if 0.89 > g(dmax , d¯R ) > 0.75 then k = 4, M = nint(0.5δ¯R ) if 0.75 > g(dmax , d¯R ) > 0.45 then k = 3, M = nint(δ¯R ) if 0.44 > g(dmax , d¯R ) > 0.2 then k = 2, M = nint(0.5Rn )  
   
  (11)  
   
  else k = 1, M = nint(0.8Rn ), where Rn is the total number of samples of the R part, and we can assign the k and M values to each R part of the signal. The values for the bounds have been determined according to the forlmula 2k modiﬁed by experimental results. 3.2  
   
  Approximation Using Modified Shephard Method for Corretion  
   
  The correction carried out with taking the linear approximation of the obtained signal. Then, it is extracted from the smoothed one. This step reveals the higher deviation, thus the next smoothing procedure can be modiﬁed accordint to its result. As we have the coordinates of the local minimum and maximum points and the vector d, we can easily ﬁt a regression line on the points between two local extrema. In this case, the ending and starting points of two consecutive lines do not necessary follow so as to match at the same value. In order to ensure the continuous joining of the lines we can perform this step by appling the Lagrange-multiplicator method given by   (m1 x(i) + b1 − y (i) )2 + (m2 x(i) + b2 − y (i) )2 ⇒ min, (12) xi ∈[x1 ,x2 ]  
   
  xi ∈[x1 ,x2 ]  
   
  with the following constraints: m1 x2 + b1 − m2 x2 + b2 .  
   
  (13)  
   
  However, in some cases the peaks can contain the information of interest. Therefore, the form of the peak or valley should be processed with special care. To addres this issue, a modiﬁed Shepard - method can be applied. Let us consider

  the points around the local extrema in radius r. The new values are calculated by weighting according to the neighboring points distance. There are several variations of the Shepard method [20], now let us consider the GM S (Groundwater M odeling System) form below i 2 ( d−d ddi ) . wi = n i 2 ( d−d ) ddi

  (x) in which ui (x) = dd(x) . Now, using the similarity between the form of Eq. 15 and the Dombi operator [5] we can deﬁne the following new parametric weighting function: 1 wi = (16) 1−uj λ ui 2 1 + ( 1−ui ) ( uj ) j=1  
   
  in which the setting of λ and radius r (where it performs) have the eﬀect on the smoothness of the result (Fig. 2).

  Simulation Results  
   
  The performance of the proposed method have been tested on a noisy signal (see, Fig. 3). The simulation has been carried out by using Matlab 8. Figure 4 shows the approximated signal after the ﬁrst round. In Fig. 5 the resulted and the original signal can be seen after two rounds. It can be observed that the applied technique can eﬃciently recover the signal.

  Conclusions  
   
  In this paper a new adaptive smooting strategy has been introduced based on the Savitzky-Golay ﬁltering technique. The proposed method allows to evade the main diﬃculties of the original SG ﬁlter by automatically setting the smoothing parameters. Furthermore, for the precise reconstruction of the signal a multi round correction has been applied using the linear approximation of the signal. For the reconstruction of the peaks and valleys that may contain the important information, a new weighting function has been introduced with the combination of the GM S method and the Dombi operator. The applicability and eﬃciency of this new strategy have been validated by simulation results. Acknowledgement.

  Abstract. Processing of remotely sensed point clouds is a crucial issue for many applications, including robots operating autonomously in real world environments, etc. The pre-processing is almost an important step which includes operations such as remove of systematic errors, ﬁltering, feature detection and extraction. In this paper we introduce a new preprocessing strategy with the combination of fuzzy information measure and wavelets that allows precise feature extraction, denoising and additionally eﬀective compression of the point cloud. The suitable setting of the applied wavelet and parameters have a great impact on the result and depends on the aim of preprocessing that usually is a challenge for the users. In order to address this problem the fuzzy information measure has been proposed that supports the adaptive setting of the parameters. Additionally a fuzzy performance measure has been introduced, that can reduce the complexity of the procedure. Simulation results validate the eﬃciency and applicability of this method.

  Introduction  
   
  Recently, there is a growing interest in several areas of engineering practice for the automatic processing methods of three-dimensional remotely sensed models. c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E.

  Most of the 3D scanning devices produce a set of data points of the environment usually deﬁned with their Descartes (x, y, z) coordinates. The resulted data set can contain faulty sensor values of the environment, disturbing noises, etc.,. Since the sampling of the raw point cloud is insuﬃcient for most applications the main steps of processing includes the outlier (extreme values) removal, noise cancellation and smoothig, surface reconstruction and feature extraction. Additionally, depending on the speciﬁc requirements of the application further post processing techniques can be used [10]. Classical approaches, for instance linear ﬁltering, can remove the noise, but with weak feature localization ability. To overcome this deﬁcieny nonlinear ﬁlters have been proposed [8,16]. Among the classical signal processing techniques, wavelet-based noise reduction has a major potential application to ﬁlter data, due to its excellent feature localization property. It reveals the information at a level of detail, which is not available with Fourier-based methods [4]. The so-called wavelet shrinkage employs nonlinear soft thresholding functions in the wavelet domain [6]. Also, the fast discrete wavelet signal transform (DWT) algorithms can fulﬁl time-critical needs. However, the selection of the appropriate wavelet and number of resolution levels, threshold function, etc. is still a challenging task. The point cloud may contain several objects, artifacts with diﬀerent surface complexity thus the diﬀerent parts need the appropriate shrinkage method. This paper introduces the fuzzy information measure for supporting the adaptive shrinkage procedure selection. The here described method conserns outlier removal and feature extraction. The complexity of an object is determined by the number of edges. In order to conserve precisely the shape that may contain the information of interest with simultaneously ﬁltering out the noise, the objects with high complexity are processed with higher levels of resolution and appropriate threshold function. While the other parts can be smoothed. Furthermore, processing all of the points can be time-consuming, thus the fuzzy performance measure proposed for selecting the minimum amount of data that is necessary for obtaining the desired result. This serves also a basis for eﬃcient data compression. The applicability and eﬃciency of this method have been validated via simulation results.

  Point Cloud Processing with the Combination of Fuzzy Information Measure and Wavelets Principles of Discrete Wavelet Shrinkage  
   
  The point cloud contains points that are returned from the terrain objects, including ground, buildings, bridges, vehicles, trees, and other non-ground features. For many applications it is important to detect, separated, or removed the artifacts in order to extract the required information [17]. Many mathematical tools have been derived for other applications need the precise reconstruction of the artifacts or involve searching for the minimum of a continuous function or

  a sizing optimization process [11]. Thus, the pre-processing is almost important step which includes operations such as remove of systematic errors, ﬁltering, feature detection and extraction, etc. The utilization and theory of wavelets is well established, for e.g. see [4]. The discrete wavelet transform analyses the signal at diﬀerent frequency scales with diﬀerent resolutions by reducing the signal into approximate and detail information. For removing noise, wavelet shrinkage employs nonlinear soft thresholding functions in the wavelet domain. The popularity of this nonparametric method is due to the excellent localization and feature extracting behavior. However several threshold estimators exist, it is still a challenging task to select the appropriate shrinkage method that ﬁts to the type of signal and contaminating noise and further, is robust against impulse type noises [6]. The other major issue in noise reduction is minimizing the eﬀects of extreme values or elements that deviate from the observation pattern (outliers) (see, for e.g. [2]). The ﬁrst step of wavelet shrinkage is the decomposition of signal into the wavelet (detail and approximate) coeﬃcients, as described in [9]. The basic idea behind wavelet shrinkage is setting the value of these coeﬃcients with small magnitude to zero (hard thresholding), or setting their value determined by a lambda (λ) threshold level [7]. After, the reconstruction is carried out by performing the inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). Generally, the shrinkage methods construct nonlinear threshold functions that relies on some statistical considerations. For instance, the smoothness-adaptive method (SureShrink) [7] is proposed to threshold each dyadic resolution level using the principle of Steins Unbiased Estimate of Risk [12], while the universal bound thresholding rule provides results with low computational complexity. The rule of the latter is deﬁned, as follows [7], √ (1) ν = σM AD 2 log sj median(ω )  
   
  where σM AD = 0.6745 j denotes the absolute median deviation. The speciﬁc choice of the wavelet function, decomposition level, and thresholding rule allows to construct many diﬀerent shrinkage procedures. 2.2  
   
  The Concept of Fuzzy Information Measure  
   
  The key issue of image processing, image understanding, data storage, information re-trieval, etc. is what carries the information in images or scenes. However, a wide range of possible concepts replies to this question, containing statistical approaches. Another, more sophisticated approach may also consider the elimination of the additive noises. This raises another question: What is noise? The main problem of answering this questions that noise is an ill-deﬁned category, because noise is usually dependent on the situation and on the objective of the processing [15]. What is characteristic or useful information in one application can be noise in another one. Based on these consideration, the amount of information in an image or point cloud strongly related to the number and complexity of the objects in it [15]. The most characteristics of the objects are their boundaries, i.e. the edges that can be extracted. Since the boundary edges  
   
  458  
   
  A. Dineva et al.  
   
  of the objects contain the primary information about the object shape, these serve as base for classiﬁcation, object recognition, etc. According to the concept of F uzzy Inf ormation M easure revealed in [14,15], also the point clouds content information can be represented by the characteristic features, like boundary edges. Thus, the amount of information in the 3D map is proportional to the number of characteristic boundary lines. 2.3  
   
  Fuzzy Information Measure for Feature Extraction  
   
  There are also some studies proposing edge detecting procedures for 3D point clouds [3]. Generally, the precise construction of a 3D edge map of the environment from remotely sensed data can be limited. The method proposed further extends our previously approach [5]. It has been shown that applying robust ﬁtting on the wavelet coeﬃcients can eﬃciently denoise the data. However, objects with high complexity need shrinking with higher resolution levels and performing the ﬁtting with higher order polynomials for preserving the details. While, the other regions that contain unimportant or sparse information can be smoothed. For separating complex objects the number and distance of the most characteristic edges are counted that carries the information. For this reason, it is not necessary to construct the full edge map, just deﬁning the areas where the density of these edges are high. For properly setting the parameters of the wavelet resolution and smoothing the fuzzy information measure, the approach supports this clustering task. As has been described, for e.g. in [3], the local neighborhood of the point is used to test whether a point lies on a potential edge or not. If there is a depth discontinuity in the lidar scan at the point is at a maximum, then that point is part of a contour edge. According to this concept, the fuzzy-edgeness is determined by the depth discontinuity. The discontinuity is determined in the wavelet domain. The μ(r) = 1 fuzzy membership value belongs to a region that carries the highest information. The fuzzy information measure of each region is determined as follows, 1 (2) μ(ri ) = (nrmax −nri ) 1+e in which nrmax denotes the number of edges in the rmax region that contains the maximum number of edges, while nri is the number of edges in the ith region. After, the areas with a high number of edges are at ﬁrst decomposed with symlet wavelets using six levels. This step serves for the separation of the noise and the parts of the signal that carries the important information. After this, the robust ﬁtting is performed on the approximate coeﬃcients. Then, the iterative reweighting of the atoms is performed based on their residuals and using a trisquare function in a short running window, according to [3]. At last, the inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) is performed. The same procedure holds for the regions with lower measure, but with applying daubechies wavelets with two levels of decomposition and for the ﬁtting a bisquare function within a long sliding window.

  Fuzzy Performance Measure  
   
  In engineering practice, the compression ratio measures the relative decrease in complexity of data in a raw form comparing it to the complexity of the compressed form after processing. However, several measures have been applied [13]. In the presented approach the robust ﬁtting performed on the wavelet coeﬃcients can be time consuming if we calculate the weights and new values

  for all the points. Once a point selected for evaluation it is not necessary for calculating again the weights in its vicinity. For selecting the points for the procedure the evaluated fuzzy information measure of the region can be used. In region ri the running window size determined by the dmax distance of the edges. In the regions mu(ri ) > 0.8 the 85% of the points are selected for evaluation, while within the regions 0.8 > mu(ri ) > 0.6 the 50% of the points are enough. These boundaries can be set according to experimental results.

  Simulation Results  
   
  The proposed approach has been tested on a lidar data available at [1]. The data set contains 65536 points. In Fig. 1 the raw data can be seen that has been aﬀected by noise. Figure 2 shows the result of the denoising with the combined approach. It can be seen, that the here described procedure ensures acceptable performance.

  Conclusions  
   
  In this paper a novel concept has been proposed for denoising and feature extracting of remotely sensed point clouds. The here described method relies on the combination of fuzzy information measure and wavelets that allows precise feature extraction, denoising and additionally eﬀective compression of the point cloud. The suitable setting of the applied wavelet and parameters have a great impact on the result and depends on the aim of preprocessing that usually is a challenge for the users. In order to address this problem the fuzzy information measure has been proposed that supports the adaptive setting of the parameters. However, the evaluation of all the points in a large data set is time consuming. For this reason, a fuzzy performance measure has been introduced, that can reduce the complexity of the procedure by reducing the number of points due to the separated regions fuzzy information measure values. Simulation results validate the eﬃciency and applicability of this method. Acknowledgements. This work has been sponsored by the Hungarian National Scientiﬁc Research Fund (OTKA 105846).

  Signiﬁcance of Glottal Closure Instants Detection Algorithms in Vocal Emotion Conversion Susmitha Vekkot and Shikha Tripathi(&) Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita University, Bengaluru, India {v_susmitha,t_shikha}@blr.amrita.edu  
   
  Abstract. The objective of this work is to explore the signiﬁcance of efﬁcient glottal activity detection for inter-emotion conversion. Performance of popular glottal epoch detection algorithms like Dynamic Projected Phase-Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), Speech Event Detection using Residual Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) and Zero Frequency Filtering (ZFF) are compared in the context of vocal emotion conversion. Existing conversion approaches deal with synthesis/conversion from neutral to different emotions. In this work, we have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of determining the conversion parameters based on statistical values derived from multiple emotions and using them for inter-emotion conversion in Indian context. Pitch modiﬁcation is effected by using transformation scales derived from both male and female speakers in IIT Kharagpur-Simulated Emotion Speech Corpus. Three archetypal emotions viz. anger, fear and happiness were generated using pitch and amplitude modiﬁcation algorithm. Analysis of statistical parameters for pitch after conversion revealed that anger gives good subjective and objective similarity while characteristics of fear and happiness are most challenging to synthesise. Also, use of male voice for synthesis gave better intelligibility. Glottal activity detection by ZFF gave results with least error for median pitch. The results from this study indicated that for emotions with overlapping characteristics like surprise and happiness, inter-emotion conversion can be a better choice than conversion from neutral.

  1 Introduction Emotions form a vital part of human communication. An emotion can be deﬁned as that state of mind which conveys the non-linguistic information from the speaker. Emotions can be expressed through multiple modalities like facial expressions, hand gestures or speech. Vocal emotion forms the non-linguistic part of expression and has a range of variations depending on speaker gender, state of mind, physiology and language. Due to this, the recognition and analysis of human emotions has always been a challenging task. Vocal emotions form part of the para-linguistic information conveyed © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  in the form of spoken language. With the advent of robotic communication technology, human-machine interaction has been gaining immense momentum during the last decade. Effective portrayal of emotions by robots requires that the parameters characterising the synthesis of emotions are estimated, analysed and manipulated at segmental, supra-segmental and sub-segmental levels. In Fants source-ﬁlter model of speech production, the source signal produced at lungs and manipulated by glottal constrictions is linearly ﬁltered through the vocal tract. The operation can be compared to convolution using a glottal source and ﬁlter. The vocal tract shapes the characteristics of the vibrations emitted from the source. The resulting sound is emitted to the surrounding air through lips [1]. Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) are deﬁned as instances of signiﬁcant excitation of resonances of vocal tract ﬁlter which corresponds to high energy in the glottal signal during voiced segment of speech and the onset points of frication in case of unvoiced speech [2]. Accurate detection of GCIs can aid in applications such as prosody modiﬁcation, speech coding/compression and speaker recognition [3]. The essence of speech production starts from glottal flow and hence a reliable estimate of parameters contributing to emotion impression in speech has to start from accurate determination of dynamics of glottal flow. Modulation characteristics of airflow can be studied by analysing and comparing the glottal waves across multiple emotions. Different algorithms have been proposed for determination of GCIs of voiced speech. These algorithms follow different approaches. Majority of them use Linear Prediction residual (LPR) for epoch extraction which can be used as the best alternative for glottal wave/its derivative [4, 5]. Fewer techniques are available for directly estimating glottal instants from speech. Researchers have been interested in developing accurate methods for glottal activity detection from the last few years. One of the important algorithms for GCI detection is done by Naylor in [6], popularly known as Dynamic Projected Phase-Slope Algorithm (DYPSA). A breakthrough algorithm for accurate detection of GCIs using Zero Frequency Filtered Signal (ZFF) was proposed in [8, 9]. One of the prominent works on glottal activity detection was carried out by Sturme by using multiscale analysis through wavelet transforms [10]. The authors computed absolute maxima along various scales and generated a tree representation. The GCIs were located at the top of the tree branches. A critical evaluation of the various algorithms for detecting GA regions was done in [11]. Important algorithms like DYPSA [6], SEDREAMS [7], ZFF [8] and wavelet based Lines Of Maximum Amplitude (LOMA) [10] were compared using data from speakers of CMU-ARCTIC database. SEDREAMS was found to have better accuracy in terms of identiﬁcation rates. Another useful technique for detecting GOIs is by estimating the Hilbert transform of the LP residual of speech [12]. Here, GOIs are estimated from difference EGG by picking secondary peaks. Performance evaluation showed an identiﬁcation rate of 99.91%. In this paper we focus on the signiﬁcance of glottal activity detection in conversion across multiple emotions. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the algorithms used to obtain the GCIs in the paper, Sect. 3 describes the implementation of inter-emotion conversion using the various epoch detection algorithms while Sect. 4 describes the results and objective evaluation using statistical values and comparison of error percentage. Finally, the paper is concluded in Sect. 5 with insights into the challenges involved and future scope of work.

  2 Algorithms for Glottal Epoch Detection This section throws light on the algorithms used for epoch detection from speech signals. 2.1  
   
  Dynamic Projected Phase-Slope Algorithm (DYPSA)  
   
  The algorithm described in [6] uses a modiﬁcation of [13] in which Group Delay function is used to determine instants of signiﬁcant excitation of glottis. As the name implies, DYPSA algorithm works on the slope of unwrapped phase of Short-Time Fourier transformed Linear Prediction (LP) residual, which is known as phase slope in Group Delay Algorithm [6]. The peak GCI candidates are identiﬁed from the positive going and projected zero-crossings of the above function. Finally, a dynamic programming approach is used to select the optimum candidates for glottal closure by minimising an objective function. 2.2  
   
  Speech Event Detection Using Residual Excitation and a Mean-Based Signal (SEDREAMS)  
   
  Speech Event Detection using Residual Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) uses a mean-based signal for epoch detection [7]. This signal is obtained as given in Eq. 1: N X 1 ym ¼ wðmÞ x ðn þ mÞ ð1Þ 2N þ 1 m¼N where x(n) is speech signal and w(m) is the window used. The GCI intervals extracted from the above signal may not give accurate detection. Hence mean based minima are found out and intervals between 2 successive minima (starting from mean based minima till 0.35 times local pitch period) are taken to represent the relative positions of GCIs [7]. For an accurate estimation, the local maxima within the above interval is found out which reﬁnes the actual GCI positions. 2.3  
   
  Zero Frequency Filtering  
   
  ZFF algorithm locates epochs in speech by computing the zero frequency ﬁltered signal [8]. Initially, the speech signal is pre-processed to remove any irregularities in recording: dðnÞ ¼ sðnÞ  sðn  1Þ ð2Þ d(n) is known as difference speech. This is ﬁltered through a cascade of two ideal zero-frequency resonators:

  Database Used  
   
  The database used for experimentation is IITKGP-SESC (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur Simulated Emotion Speech Corpus) which is recorded using 10 (5 male and 5 female) experienced professional artists from All India Radio (AIR) Vijayawada, India. For analysing the emotions 15 emotionally neutral Telugu sentences are considered in which each artist speaks with 8 emotions viz. neutral, anger, happy, fear, compassion, sarcasm, surprise and disgust. Each emotion has 1500 utterances, thus making the total utterances to 12000, lasting for around 7 h [14]. The speech signal was sampled at 16 kHz. For the current study, we have considered 4 basic emotions in IIT-KGP database viz. neutral, anger, happy and fear from male and female artists. For each of the emotions, statistical values i.e. median, mean and standard deviation of pitch are calculated from 10 different utterances. For each speech sample, GCIs are located using each of the above discussed algorithms and used for inter-emotion conversion using the statistical values computed. Inter-emotion conversion among the above 4 emotions is carried out and results are tabulated. The statistical values for pitch of the emotions considered in this paper for male and female speakers are given in Table 1. 3.2  
   
  Pitch Transformation Scales  
   
  Using the statistical values obtained above, the transformation scales for conversion across different emotions have been obtained using Eq. 5: Pitchfactorð%Þ ¼

  For analysis, the percentage change is chosen by taking the median value of each of the pitch parameters in the database. This is done to overcome the changes in the mean

  value due to few irregularities in parameter values. Median of a data distribution gives a more accurate estimation as it does not take into account the irregularities. Also, the median and mean differ by less than 5% [15]. The percentage change to be incorporated in original emotions for conversion in each case is given in Table 2. Applying the pitch transformation scales below, the variations in pitch has been effected corresponding to each emotion. After pitch scaling, the resulting speech sample is subjected to amplitude scaling by multiplying the intermediate signal with the amplitude tier of the target emotion. Thus pitch and amplitude scaling for each emotion is performed. The statistical parameters are recalculated after conversion. The results are compared with the median values for target emotion as we have derived the transform scales based on median value. 3.3  
   
  Inter-emotion Conversion  
   
  Implementation of emotional conversion is carried out in this paper as a two-stage process. The ﬁrst stage involves incorporating the transformation scales obtained from Table 2 in pitch modiﬁcation algorithm. The ﬁrst stage of the conversion process makes use of dynamic pitch modiﬁcation algorithm depicted by Govind et al. [16]. This method has been chosen based on the efﬁciency in preserving the prosodic variations for high arousal emotions. Stage I 1. Estimate the instants of signiﬁcant excitation/glottal closure using the algorithm chosen for GCI detection. 2. Get the epoch intervals as difference between successive GCIs. 3. Modiﬁcation factor, mq for every qth interval is expressed as an integer ratio Aq/Bq. The initial value for modiﬁcation factor is the transformation scale value derived from Table 2. 4. mq corresponding to each emotion is derived based on transform scale Eq. 5. 5. New epoch instants are obtained by equally dividing the qth and q + Ath location into Bq intervals.

  6. The modiﬁed epoch locations are derived from modiﬁed instants computed in step 5 of the algorithm. 7. Similarly, the modiﬁed instants for each successive interval are calculated by incrementing qth location value by 1. 8. Repeat steps 3–7 until end location to generate new instants sequence. 9. Modiﬁed instants are concatenated and new pitch anchor points generated. 10. Speech waveform is reconstructed by copying the speech samples existing in each epoch interval to the adjacent modiﬁed epoch interval in the modiﬁed instants sequence obtained [17].

  The second stage involves intensity modiﬁcation by imposition of amplitude changes of target emotion into the pitch modiﬁed signal from the ﬁrst stage. The algorithmic steps involved in conversion are listed below: Stage II 1. The pitch modiﬁed speech signal is saved as.wav ﬁle and extracted for further processing. 2. The target emotion speech ﬁle is processed to separate the intensity tier. 3. The amplitude variations in target emotion are imposed on pitch modiﬁed speech by multiplying the extracted amplitude tier with the pitch modiﬁed speech signal.

The percentage error rates have been calculated for each GCI algorithm based inter-emotion conversion and the results have been listed in Table 4. A graphical comparison between the algorithms has been drawn in Fig. 2. As we have used the scaling factor taking into account the median values, a comparison has been drawn based on median values.

  From the experiments, some observations have been made: • Median value forms a better estimate for probabilistic study of various emotions as it is free from irregularities. • Conversion efﬁciency is higher for anger target in both neutral-emotion and inter-emotion cases. This is because anger is mainly categorized by higher pitch and intensity. The variations done as part of this work also focussed on pitch and intensity scaling. Anger gave best results for perception also. • Most deviation in results was obtained for conversion to/from fear emotion. Fear emotion is characterised with large variance and lower energy with the addition of a panic or anxiety component, thus giving rise to a breathy quality to voice. Mere pitch, duration and amplitude variations are unable to incorporate the harmonics and voice quality of fear.

  • Conversion to/from happy also yielded average perception results. But the pitch contour of the synthesised emotion was found to be matching with original happy to some extent as shown by Fig. 1. Though the algorithm succeeded in bringing the pitch and intensity to the required level, it still failed to bring in the smooth rippling kind of inflexions normally found in happy speech. • From the error comparison Table 4, the minimum percentage error is obtained for emotion conversion in case of male speaker. As far as inter-emotion conversion is concerned, though the trends are fluctuating for the various algorithms we can see that an optimal choice of ZFF for epoch estimation gives acceptable error values. Also, the conversion error is maximum for fear case in both male and female speakers which is rightly correlated by experimental ﬁndings and perception. • The average computation time required for execution of conversion algorithm from neutral to emotion and between emotions were computed for each GCI algorithm and it was found that they are closely similar (around 220–260 µs). This shows that no restriction exists while choosing the mode of conversion (neutral emotion/emotion - emotion) and either can be chosen depending on interrelationship between source and target. For instance, conversion from surprise to happy yielded good objective and perceptive results in all cases (Table 3). This is due to the fact that surprise is depicted in the database as “pleasant”. • We found that the conversion efﬁciency depends on expressivity of database to a large extent. Emotions like happy and fear can be better distinguished from angry and sadness if the speaker displays the emotion with characteristic precision. In some cases, the enacted database fails to bring in the complex inundations and voice modulations of emotions while spontaneous recording can bring in a much perceivable quality to the target.  
   
  5 Conclusions The experiments on inter-emotion conversion gave acceptable results for pitch variations. Conversion to anger yielded best objective and perceptive results while fear and happiness conversions failed to bring in the dynamics of emotion involved. For emotions like happiness and surprise, the synthesised emotion was better perceived when converted from each other than from neutral emotion. However, though the computation time required for inter-emotion conversion using various GCI detection algorithms were similar, ZFF gave best results in terms of conversion error rate (%). Studies proved that in addition to incorporating variations in prosody, determining the voice quality parameters in emotion conversion and embedding these at proper instances are instrumental in making the target more expressive and intelligible. The challenge lies in suitably inserting the parameters thus determined without distorting the spectral characteristics of normal speech and further, making a generalized framework for emotion conversion which is database, speaker and language independent.

  Abstract. Since digital images require a large space on the storage devices and the network bandwidth, many compression methods have been used to solve this problem. Actually, these methods have, more or less, good results in terms of compression ratio and the quality of the reconstructed images. There are two main types of compression: the lossless compression which is based on the scalar quantization and the lossy compression which rests on the vector quantization. Among the vector quantization algorithms, we can cite the Kohonen’s network. To improve the compression result, we add a pre-processing phase. This phase is performed on the image before applying the Kohonen’s network of compression. Such a phase is the wavelet transform. Indeed, this paper is meant to study and model an approach to image compression by using the wavelet transform and Kohonen’s network. The compression settings for the approach to the model are based on the quality metrics rwPSNR and MSSIM. Keywords: Image compression Learning algorithm

  1 Introduction Digital images pose a problem of transmission time and storage volume. The compression techniques can reduce the space needed to represent a certain amount of information. The compression techniques are divided into two main categories. First, the lossy compression in which some of the information in the original image is lost. Second, the lossless compression exploits the information redundancy in the image to reduce its size. The lossy compression methods [1] are more likely to achieve higher compression ratio than those obtained by the lossless methods [2, 5]. The methods of image compression by neural networks [3] yield acceptable results. Yet, these methods have a limit on the compression ratio and the reconstructed image quality. To improve the reconstructed image quality, we combine the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [11] and the quantization by Kohonen’s networks [4]. Thereafter, we use the Huffman coding to encode the quantized values [6, 14]. In this paper, we are interested in the study of an approach to image compression through the use of the wavelet transform and Kohonen’s network. We will, in particular, detail the learning © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  process of image compression and evaluate the compression result with a new quality metric rwPSNR “relative weighted PSNR”. To develop and improve the assessment, we will use another quality metric; namely, the MSSIM “Means Structural SIMilarity”. Next, we test the image compression by using the wavelet and Kohonen’s network together. Lastly, we make a comparison by using Kohonen’s network only without the wavelet transform and the second comparison between the proposed approach and various compression methods.

  Image compression is carried out through the following steps: • Apply a wavelet transform [9, 22] to an original image depending on the decomposition level and the wavelet type. • Decompose the image into blocks according to a block size (for example 2  2, 4  4, 8  8 or 16  16). • Search the codebook for each block and the code word with a minimum distance from the block. The index of the selected word is added to the index vector that represents the compressed image. • Code the index vector by a Huffman coding [14]. • Save the index vectors coded for use during decompression. The Fig. 1 depicts the steps of compression.

  Learning Phase  
   
  In fact, learning [7, 8] is deemed to be a very important step to compress images by the neural network. The goal is to construct codebooks to be used during compression. The learning process is described in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst step of learning is the wavelet transform of an original image to obtain four sub-images: an approximation image and three detail-images (Fig. 4) in different resolutions depending on the decomposition level and the wavelet choice. The second step is to decompose the four sub-images in blocks according to the block sizes (2  2, 4  4, 8  8 or 16  16). The blocks are arranged in linear vectors to be presented in the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [4, 16] one after the other. The third step is to adjust the weight-coupling according to an index vector. The weights obtained at the end of learning represent the codebook which will be used for compression. The codebook obtained depends on several settings such as the choice of the learning image, the type

  of the wavelet transform, the decomposition level, the block size and the size of the self-organizing map. Therefore, we should create several codebooks to improve the compression.

  Image Decompression  
   
  Image decompression is realized throughout these steps: • Replace each code by the corresponding index to obtain the index vector. This is the decoding step. • Find the three detail-images and the approximation image by replacing each element of the index vector by the corresponding block in the codebook. In order to improve the reconstructed image quality, in our approach, we keep the approximation image un-indexed by the self organization map. • The inverse transform is applied to the sub-images obtained after de-quantization to display the reconstructed image. The Fig. 3 described the decompression steps.

  Kohonen’s Network Algorithm  
   
  Kohonen’s network algorithm [4, 10] follows these steps: • Find the winning neuron of the competition

  The function h deﬁned the extent of the correction to the winning neuron c and its neighborhood. In instant t, the neighbors of winning neuron c are determined by the function Nðc; tÞ. The ﬁnal neighbors of a neuron consist of the neuron itself. The function hðc; i; tÞ assigns the same correction aðtÞ for all neurons belonging to the neighbors of the winning neuron at instant t [18]. 2.5  
   
  Image Pretreatment Using Wavelet Transform  
   
  The two-dimension-wavelet transform [9, 10] is adopted in our approach. Figure 4 shows the image division into sub-images for the case of seven-band decomposition. The sub-image LL2 represents the lowest frequency of the original image. As a matter of fact, the restoration of the wavelet coefﬁcients in the sub-image LL2 will directly affect the image quality. The sub-images HH1, LH1, HL1, HH2, LH2, and HL2 contain detail information of the edge, the outline and the vein of the image at different decomposition layers. Concretely, the sub-image HL2 and the sub-image HL1 denote the image-coefﬁcient at the vertical edge after the ﬁrst and the second layers wavelet decomposition. The sub-image LH2 and the sub-image LH1 indicate the image coefﬁcients at the horizontal edge. The sub-image HH1 and the sub-image HH2 signify the image coefﬁcients on the cross edge. LL2

  3 Objective Assessments: The Quality Index To improve our method, we use tow quality metric: rwPSNR and MSSIM. 3.1  
   
  The Relative Weighted Peak Signal to Noise Ratio rwPSNR  
   
  The PSNR quantiﬁes an intensity of the distortion. It does not adjust to the dynamic characteristics of the image. Indeed, the deterioration is more visible in less textured zones (weak variance) and is less visible in more textured zones (stronger variance) [20]. Accordingly, we take the variance of the picture into consideration. Hence, it increases when the variance is high and decreases in the opposite case. We will have a new deﬁnition of the MSE. Let X = {xij | I = 1, …, M; j = 1, …, N}and Y = {yij | I = 1, …, M; j = 1, …, N} be the original image and the test image, respectively. The wMSE is given as:   2 1 X N 1   X xm;n  ym;n  1 M wMSE ¼ MN m¼0 n¼0 1 þ Var ðM; N Þ  
   
  ð4Þ  
   
  Where Var(M, N) is the test image variance. The human eyes do not have an equal sensitivity across the different intensities. In fact, there is a threshold of sensitivity that must be exceeded before an increase of the intensity so that it can be detected. So, as a complement to the wPSNR, we introduce our rwPSNR [12] “relative weighted PSNR” which takes account of the relative difference of the image-gray levels because the noticeable difference of the two stimuli is roughly proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. Actually, an error between two pixels of two images can not translate the same error deviation between two pixels of two other images with the same intensity difference. Indeed, if the intensity difference (10) between the pixels is 10 and 20, it remains numerically the same as that between a pair of pixel values 110 and 120. However, the perception differs on the visual plan. In the ﬁrst case, the error is quantiﬁed at 100% (20 to 10). But, in the second case, the error is quantiﬁable at 10% (120-110). Therefore, one has to think about the necessity of introducing the relative difference notion in the calculation of the wPSNR from which rwPSNR is derived. So, we have a new deﬁnition of the MSE noted as rwMSE “relative weighted Mean Square Error” which takes account of the variance and the image intensity. Our rwMSE is deﬁned as follows: Let X = {x | i = 1, …, M; j = 1, …, N} and Y = {y | i = 1, …, M; j = 1, …, N} respectively be the original image and the test image. The rwMSE is given as: 2 1 X N 1  X 1 M jðx  yÞ=ðx þ yÞj rwMSE ¼ 2 MN m¼0 n¼0 1 þ Var ðM; N Þ The expression of our relative weighted peak signal to noise ratio is given by:  2  xmax rwPSNR ¼ 10  log10 rwMSE

  The Structural Similarity Means MSSIM  
   
  The new image quality measurement design is based on the assumption that the human visual system is highly adapted to extract the structural information of the visual ﬁeld. The measurement of the structural information change can provide a good approximation of the distortion of the perceived image. The error sensitivity approach estimates the perceived errors to quantify the image degradation [21]; whereas, the new philosophy considers the degradation of the image as the perceived changes in the structural information. The luminosity of the surface of the observed object is the product of illumination and reflection. But the structures of the objects in the scene are independent of illumination [23]. Therefore, to explore the structural information in an image, we have to eliminate the influence of illumination. Therefore, the structural information in an image is deﬁned as the attributes that represent the structures of the objects. Since luminosity and contrast may vary across the scene, we use luminosity and the local contrasts in our deﬁnition. The system breaks the task of similarity measurement into three comparisons: Luminosity Lðx; yÞ, Contrast Cðx; yÞ and Structure Sðx; yÞ. The combination of the three comparisons determines the structural similarity index (SSIM) [13]. SSIMðx; yÞ ¼  
   
  ð2lx ly þ C1 Þð2rxy þ C2 Þ þ l2y þ C1Þðr2x þ r2y þ C2 Þ  
   
  ðl2x  
   
  ð7Þ  
   
  When applying, only one total quality measurement of the whole image is required; whence, a means SSIM index (MSSIM) to assess the overall quality of the image is determined. MSSIMðX; YÞ ¼  
   
  M 1X SSIMðxi ; yi Þ M i¼1  
   
  ð8Þ  
   
  4 Subjective Assessments The objective assessment is insufﬁcient to assess the visual quality of the compression methods. The subjective assessment analyzes the degradation of visual quality of images. Also, the human eye can judge the compression quality to compare the result between compression methods [19]. In our work, we compare tow compression methods with and without wavelet transform. 4.1  
   
  Quantitative Assessments of Results  
   
  In our work, we change the compression parameters: the decomposition level (j) of the wavelet, the input block size (BS), the wavelet type (haar, Coiflets, Daubechies, Symlets, …) and the size of the self organizing map (SOM). To evaluate the performance of our approach in image compression, we use the following measures: bits per pixel (Nbpp), the means square error (MSE), the relative weighted peak signal to the noise ratio (rwPSNR) and the structural similarity means (MSSIM) and we compare our approach to image compression without using the wavelet transform (Tables 1 and 2).

  Table 3 shows an objective assessment of the relative weighted peak signal to the noise ratio (rwPSNR) depending on the number of bits per pixel (Nbpp). The blue curve represents the rwPSNR of the compressed images using the discrete wavelet transform and Kohonen’s network. The green curve represents the rwPSNR of the compressed images using only Kohonen’s network without the wavelet transform. Thus, we see very well that the image quality calculated by our metric (rwPSNR) has been improved by the compression approach using the wavelet transform compared to the other approach without wavelet transform. Table 4 shows an objective assessment of the structural similarity means (MSSIM) depending on the number of bits per pixel (Nbpp). The blue curve represents the MSSIM of the compressed images using the discrete wavelet transform and Kohonen’s network. The green curve represents the MSSIM of the compressed images using only Kohonen’s network without the wavelet transform.

  Comparison Between Our Approach and Various Methods  
   
  To evaluate our result, we use the standard image quality metrics for comparisons with other methods. The standard metrics is Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Tables 5 and 6 show the comparison between the proposed approach and various methods [10, 15, 17]. The methods were applied on standard images 256 * 256 (Lena and Cameraman): Neural Network one level, Neural Network two level [15], standard and modiﬁed Self-Organization Map SOM [10] and wavelet transform combined by Vector Quantization VQ [17].

  Simulation and Results  
   
  Our work is based on the comparison of different compression methods. The performance evaluation using various image quality metrics like PSNR, rwPSNR, MSE and MSSIM indicates that the best method is the wavelet transform and kohonen’s network. After comparing the two compression methods with and without wavelet transform, we can show the importance of using the wavelet transform in compression. In fact, the wavelet transform allows reducing the entropy of the image and separating its details to improve the quality of the reconstructed image according to the number of bits per pixel (Tables 3 and 4). The reconstructed image quality is acceptable; i.e. for rwPSNR it is more than 59 and for MSSIM it is between 0.7 and 1. The block effect is remarkable if the block size (BS) is higher than 256 and the degradation of the visual quality if the level of decomposition of the wavelet (J) is superior or equal to 2. For performance evaluation, the proposed method is compared with various methods [10, 15, 17]. The comparison is done using various measures such as PSNR, the number of bits per pixel Nbpp and compression ratio CR. From Tables 5 and 6, we can be deduced that the PSNR according of bits per pixel compression ratio of our

  method is better than of the some compression methods. From Table 5, the PSNR of our method is 25.18 and the CR is 82.59% but the PSNR of NNs with two levels [15] is 24.7 and CR is 81.3%. So, the PSNR and CR are better in proposed approach  
   
  5 Future Scope and Conclusion In this paper, we use an image compression approach based on the wavelet transform and the vector quantization by Kohonen’s network and the Huffman coding. We use two metrics to assess the reconstructed image quality: rwPSNR and MSSIM. We compare our method with other compression methods. The comparison is done using various standard measures such as PSNR and CR, it can be recognized that the PSNR according to CR of our method is better than some of the methods. To improve the reconstructed image quality and the compression ratio, we will add a phase of pre-treatment before the wavelet transform. We will use Weber-Fechner law and the A-law, which are used in the ﬁeld of telephony, to quantify an image through the semi-logarithmic method.

  Abstract. A nuclear spectrum is a Type II digital signal. It is processed to extract the qualitative and the quantitative information about the radioisotopes. Noise reduction is usually a step in processing a spectrum, and smoothing ﬁlters are employed for this. Perhaps the most widely used ﬁlters for the spectral ﬁlter-ing since the last 50 years have been Savitzky-Golay (S-G) ﬁlters. Incidentally S-G ﬁlters are not well known to the digital signal processing community. In this paper the authors have employed rather unknown high ﬁdelity Higham ﬁlters used by actuaries of the 19th century for ﬁltering real observed nuclear spectra, and compared their performance with that of an optimal S-G ﬁlter. It was observed that the performance of the Higham ﬁlters and S-G ﬁlters compared favorably amongst each other. This paper describes theory of S-G and Higham ﬁlters, their application to nuclear spectra, and presents the results. Higham ﬁlters have potential for more applications. There is a scope of exploring more treasure of the past, and merging tools from various disciplines, for more interdisciplinary research.

  1 Introduction A nuclear spectrum e.g. a gamma-ray spectrum is processed to extract the qualitative and the quantitative information about the radioisotopes emitting gamma photons. In a typical observed nuclear spectrum over 90% of the information is lost thus greatly reducing the information capacity of a nuclear spectrometer. Processing of a spectrum usually involves employing a smoothing ﬁlter to reduce noise. It is desired that the ﬁlter should retain spectroscopic information content of the spectrum while attenuating noise. It is sometimes assumed that smoothing is manipulation of data without clear theoretical justiﬁcation. Digital signal processing (DSP) gives a clear theoretical justiﬁcation of a smoothing operation. In the frequency domain the signal containing the desired information gets concentrated in the low-frequency region while distortions extend up to p rad. The separation of signal and distortions appears most clear in the frequency domain. In any other domain like sequency domain, the clarity of separation gets obscured. A smoothing ﬁlter is thus adequately justiﬁed [1–8]. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  Perhaps the most widely used smoothing ﬁlters for the nuclear spectra since the last 50 years have been due to Savitzky and Golay [8]. These are linear phase, noncausal, FIR smoothing ﬁlters, also known as polynomial smoothing ﬁlters, or least squares smoothing ﬁlters. They have been widely used but not well known to the digital signal processing (DSP) community, and “only one out of about 20 had heard of them” [9]. One of the authors (VKM) interacted with both communities, DSP experts as well as nuclear scientists, and had similar experience, and was comforted to read lecture notes of Prof. Schafer [9], a highly respected DSP expert. Earlier the author happened to contribute to a bandwidth matching smoothing criterion for the S-G ﬁlters [3]. To bridge the gap between the two communities, he had contributed to a new classiﬁcation of digital signals viz. Type I and Type II based on the fundamental problems of aliasing and quantization noise. The classiﬁcation has widened the role of DSP to many disciplines [1, 4, 5]. In the larger perspective DSP techniques to nuclear spectral processing have hardly been used, though the beneﬁts of DSP are widely accepted in diverse applications of science and technology. The least squares peak ﬁtting functions entirely dominate the literature of this ﬁeld, and these methods fall to a large extent within the category of “art-forms” rather than of “direct methods” [5]. Though DSP methods have not been widely used for the processing of nuclear spectra, they hold a good potential. Only a few researchers have reported the use of DSP techniques in this area. DSP methods for spectral processing, however, proved to be advantageous. They have enhanced the understanding of nuclear spectra while helping in the reﬁnement, extension, and consolidation of various algorithms. The methods have further helped in developing new algorithms especially suited to the spectra and are extremely simple, easy, and fast [1–3, 5, 6]. In the 19th century FIR ﬁlters were employed for actuarial data processing [10–12]. The authors have explored two linear phase, high ﬁdelity, FIR Higham ﬁlters from that era to ﬁlter real observed gamma spectra, and compared their performance with an optimal S-G ﬁlter for ﬁltering the same spectra. The performance of the three ﬁlters was found favourable with respect to each other. To the authors knowledge Higham ﬁlters have neither been used in electrical engineering nor in nuclear spectrometry. Besides nuclear spectrometry, the ﬁlters hold a potential for their application to infrared spectrometry, analytical chemistry, heart rate monitoring using an accelerometer, speech and image processing etc. and that needs to be explored. This paper describes Type I and Type II signals, smoothing ﬁlters viz. S-G and Higham, and their application to ﬁltering real observed nuclear spectra.  
   
  2 Type I and Type II Signals A digital signal can be represented as a mathematical function: yðxÞ ¼ A sin ð2p fx þ hÞ  
   
  ð1Þ  
   
  where both y(x) and its argument, x, are quantized. The quantity A is the amplitude, f is the frequency and h is the phase angle.

  To widen the scope of DSP, a new classiﬁcation of digital signals was given by Madan and Sinha [4, 5]. It is based on the fundamental problems of aliasing and quantization noise. Aliasing is a phenomenon where higher-frequency components take on the identity of lower-frequency components because of low sampling rate. It is addressed along the abscissa. Quantization error is the difference between the actual value of the signal and its quantized value. The noise power associated with the quantization of signals is called quantization noise. Type I digital signals are those where the problems of aliasing and quantization noise are addressed along the abscissa and the ordinate respectively. In Type II digital signals both the problems are addressed along the abscissa. DSP methods, widely used for processing Type I signals, are generally not used for processing Type II signals. The methods have, however, numerous advantages for processing Type II signals, e.g. nuclear spectra and age returns [4, 5]. The classiﬁcation of signals arises because of the acquisition process of signals. While acquiring a DSP signals, both Type I and Type II, one has to ensure that aliasing should not be there, and quantization noise should be below a threshold. Once signals have been acquired, DSP techniques like ﬁltering, deconvolution, Fourier domain processing etc. can be employed to process the signals. It may be mentioned that DSP techniques have demonstrated advantages, both theoretically and in implementation, for processing Type II signals like nuclear spectra and age returns. These methods, however, have hardly been employed. Figure 1 describes generation of a Type I digital signal like a speech signal, while Fig. 2 describes generation of a Type II digital signal like a nuclear spectrum. Figure 1 is well known to electrical engineers while Fig. 2 is not well known to the engineers.

  The Fig. 2 is described in more detail. Sampling instant is considered as the time when a given pulse arising out of nuclear radiation is detected, and immediately after the process of sampling, the pulse is quantized.

  Let’s go through the signal theory for the two different situations. Figure 1 depicts electrical waveform in a common digital signal processing chain. Assume x(t) as the input waveform which is sampled at uniform intervals of time T. It is assumed that T is a constant irrespective of the variations in an analog signal, and due to jitter, which is assumed to be insigniﬁcant. The sampled signal xs(t) is given as: xs ð t Þ ¼

  where, dðt  nT Þ is a unit impulse at time instant t = nT. In Fig. 1 quantization is done by a commercial ADC. In Fig. 2 it is done by a NADC, and the digital signals are condensed into a histogram thus generating a nuclear spectrum. The histogram is generated by employing the reconstruction ﬁlter. It is a zero order hold (ZOH) ﬁlter. It helps in maintaining the same level of the signal in a spectral channel.

The charge collected by the detector, and then processed by the preampliﬁer produces sharp rising and pulses which decay with a large time constant. The pulses are shaped into Gaussian like pulses by the spectroscopy ampliﬁer and they are condensed into histogram by a multichannel analyser (MCA) thus generating a nuclear spectrum. The spectrum is ﬁltered and then further processing like background removal, deconvolution etc. is carried out to eventually extract the information about the radioisotoes emitting the nuclear radiation [1, 2].

  4 Savitzky-Golay and Higham FIR Smoothing Filters In this section S-G and two Higham FIR ﬁlters are described. Both ﬁlters are noncausal, linear phase (symmetric) ﬁlters. S-G ﬁlters have been widely used and are easily found in the open literature albeit not in most DSP textbooks. Most DSP experts have not even heard of S-G ﬁlters [9]. As far Higham FIR ﬁlters, the authors have neither seen their application in electrical engineering nor in nuclear ﬁeld. Described below is the theory of S-G and Higham ﬁlters. 4.1  
   
  Savitzky-Golay Filters  
   
  The S-G FIR smoothing ﬁlters, are also known as polynomial smoothing, or least-squares smoothing ﬁlters. It is a happy coincidence that the least squares polynomial ﬁtting turns out to be FIR symmetric smoothing ﬁlters. S-G ﬁlters preserve high-frequency content representing peaks in a nuclear spectrum while attenuating noise.

  V. Kher et al.  
   
  Savitzky and Golay put a polynomial to a set of input samples and then at the single point, evaluated the resulting polynomial with least squares ﬁtting [8, 9]. Mathematically it proved to be a discrete convolution having ﬁxed symmetric ﬁnite impulse response. The smoothing ﬁlter obtained by the least squares method helps in reduction of noise while preserving the shape and height of the nuclear spectral peaks. Consider for the moment the group of (2M + 1) samples of the signal x[n] centered at n = 0, we obtain the coefﬁcients, ak , of a polynomial, pðnÞ, that minimizes pðnÞ ¼

  The analysis is the same for any other group of (2M + 1) input samples. We will refer to M as the “half width” of the approximation interval. In S-G ﬁlter, the ﬁtted polynomial to the sampled signal is similar to a ﬁxed linear combination of the local set of input samples; the set of (2M + 1) input samples which are within the approximation interval are combined by a ﬁxed set of weighting coefﬁcients that can be calculated once for a given polynomial of order N, and remains same for another approximation interval of length 2M + 1. The polynomial coefﬁcients, ak , represent impulse response h[n] of the FIR ﬁlter. Thus the output samples can be obtained by a discrete convolution method of the form: y ½ n ¼

  Higham Filters  
   
  Higham proposed ﬁlters that have high ﬁdelity and are simple to implement. We briefly describe here Higham ﬁlters using the notation used by the then actuaries. Let n point boxcar average be represented as: 1 yi ¼ ½nxi n

  where A1 and A2 are both summation ﬁlters, and a and b are scalars. Higham designed a number of ﬁlters including the following two. The authors could not ﬁnd the detailed derivations of the Higham ﬁlters in the literature they had access to. The derivations were derived by the authors by hand using the Eqs. 10 and 11, and let these ﬁlters be called as Higham Filter 1 and Higham Filter 2 respectively. Both the ﬁlters resulted in 17 points smoothing ﬁlters [10–15]. 1 ½2½53 ½4½2  3½54 xi 125   64 4 4 2 ½5  ½5 ½9 xi yi ¼ 10000 300

  5 Experimental Results The real observed gamma-ray spectra were used in this paper. The spectra were taken from two earlier publications by one of the authors [3, 7]. These two spectral data sets were acquired using two different nuclear spectrometers. S-G, Higham Filter 1, and Higham Filter 2 ﬁlters were employed to ﬁlter the spectra. An optimal smoothing interval of 17 was chosen for all the smoothing ﬁlters [3]. It may be mentioned that in the earlier two publications [3, 7] employed only S-G ﬁlters to the spectra. The effect of smoothing on the spectra was investigated by employing all the three ﬁlters. The investigation included visual inspection, observing monotonicity in spectral peaks viz. it should be monotonically increasing before and monotonically decreasing after the peak position, change in full width at half maximum (FWHM), change in percentage peak areas using difference between sum of counts in the peak region of raw and smoothed spectra, and sum of the squared values of difference between the raw and

  smoothed spectral counts in the peak region, and it is called error squared values. The percentage change in peak area used the following formula: Percentage Change in Peak Area ¼ 100

  Figure 5 depicts the raw, and the smoothed spectra obtained by employing the Higham Filter 1, and the S-G ﬁlter to one set of data, while Fig. 6 depicts the raw, and the smoothed spectra obtained by employing the Higham Filter 2, and the S-G ﬁlter to the other set of data. The visual inspection of the smoothed spectra employing Higham Filter 1, Higham Filter 2, and S-G on both the observed spectra indicated that smoothing effects were pronounced. The spectra were shifted vertically arbitrarily to get clarity of display in the ﬁgures. The channel number and counts in the ﬁgures correspond to energy and intensity respectively of nuclear radiation. From the printout of the ﬁltered spectral data it was observed that the monotonicity as mentioned above was met in all the smoothed spectra. The changes in FWHM for all the smoothed spectral peaks were found by plotting the raw, and the smoothed spectra. It was observed that the change in FWHM was on the order of 0.1 channels for all the smoothed spectra. It is negligible. This indicates all the ﬁlters preserved high-frequency content representing peaks in a nuclear spectrum while attenuating noise. The Tables 1 and 2 depict sum of error squared values, and percentage change in peak areas respectively between the raw and the smoothed spectra. From the Table 1, it is observed that the sum of the error squared values for Higham ﬁlters were little better those for the S-G ﬁlters. It is observed from the Table 2 that the percentage change in peak areas by employing Higham and S-G ﬁlters were within 0.02% and hence negligible.

  However the relative error squared values depicted in Table 1, and the relative changes in percentage peak areas depicted in Table 2 can be considered as within the experimental limits. Hence from the above performance metrics it is concluded that the smoothing performance of all the three ﬁlters was favorable with respect to each other. Higham ﬁlters have potential for their application to many areas and that should be explored.  
   
  6 Conclusion For nuclear spectral ﬁltering, perhaps the most widely used ﬁlters since the last 50 years have been S-G ﬁlters. However the ﬁlters are not well known to the DSP community, and “only one out of about 20 had heard of them” [7]. The authors have employed rather unknown Higham ﬁlters from the 19th century for ﬁltering of real observed nuclear spectra. To the authors knowledge these ﬁlters  
   
  496  
   
  V. Kher et al.  
   
  have neither been employed in electrical engineering nor for nuclear applications. The performance of the Higham ﬁlters and S-G ﬁlter compared favorably with respect to each other. This paper demonstrated an interdisciplinary approach to nuclear spectral ﬁltering. It has merged modern and 19th century tools from disciplines with encouraging application to nuclear spectrometry. Higham ﬁlters have potential for their application to infrared spectrometry, analytical chemistry, heart rate monitoring using an accelerometer, speech and image processing etc. and that needs to be explored. There is a scope of exploring more treasure of the past, and there is a need, perhaps more than ever, for merging of tools from various disciplines for the interdisciplinary research to be effective and fruitful.

Mesh quality is a determining factor in treatment of effectiveness, accuracy of results and rendering quality. You can show users these 3D meshes with a texture on the 3D mesh surface. The estimated quality by an observer is a very complex task related to the complexity of the Human Visual System (HVS). In this paper we present the efﬁciency of perceptual quality metrics 3D meshes based on the human visual system. Keywords: Perceptual quality

  1 Introduction For several years, researchers in image [1] processing and computer graphics have worked on the deﬁnition of an effective objective metric, able to predict the perceived quality of images, videos and 3D scenes [2]. To design such a system, it was necessary to study and determine the structures of visual content. This task is more complex when we look at 3D content represented in the form of triangular meshes. These 3D meshes are generally discrete packets of a non- uniform way to represent objects and scenes. Also, many operation can be performed on this 3D meshes [3], for example If we want to protect the 3D content we can use watermarking mesh algorithms for security purposes. It is also possible to apply a compression scheme to transmit on a low bandwidth network [4, 5] to reduce the size of 3D meshes [6]. Other operations on 3D meshes can be used, among which we mention: the quantiﬁcation, enameling or deformation. These algorithms usually introduce inevitable distortion on the geometry sufaces mesh. It is therefore important to measure and evaluate the effect of these distortions that affect the quality triangular meshes.  
   
  2 The Perceptual Quality 3D Meshes The study of perceptual quality is an important task since most visual data are for a ﬁnal human observer. Measuring the perceptual quality can be carried out using measurements made by observers (subjective measures) or measurements from © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al. (eds.), Soft Computing Applications, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 633, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-62521-8_43

  algorithmic processes (objective measures). For each observer, quality can have a different deﬁnition of personal criteria. The main objective of measuring the perceptual quality is to analyze the behavior of the HVS [7] and quantify the quality as perceived by observers [8]. Human Vision System is based on two mechanisms: low-level mechanisms that affect the biophysical structure of the sensory system and high-level mechanisms related to human cognitive system.  
   
  3 Objective Measures of Quality Meshes The estimate of the perceptual quality is an important element in assessing the meshes quality after treatments. The objective of the perceptual quality metrics is to judge the quality of a mesh based on human perception characteristics [9]. To do this, there are different approaches the top-down approach considers the HVS as a black box and tries to imitate the behavior of the system from the perspective of inputs/outputs and the bottom-up approach based on simulation and imitation of each component of HVS. To develop a 3D metrics [10], researchers can use two alternatives: either they use existing metrics of perceptual quality 2D images [11–13] on two-dimensional projections of 3D meshes (metric-based images and videos) or they use develop metrics based-models that exploit the term mesh geometry and connectivity signal to evaluate the quality [14]. To estimate the quality of 3D meshes, other classiﬁcation of the quality metrics is possible. * Metrics “Full – Reference”: The original model is available in full, in which case we will try to quantify the existing difference between the original image and the degraded version. * Metrics to “Reduced Reference”: The original image is available in its entirety, but is represented by a vector containing a reduced set of attributes. In this case, an attempt to quantify the difference existing between the vectors associated to the original image and the vector resulting from a distorted version. * Metrics “No – Reference”: The original image is not available. In this case, it is possible to work with a priori on the degradation types that may be encountered, or, conversely, by making no assumption about possible distortions. Many of these metrics exploit the proprieties of the human visual system. To compare two 2D images or 3D meshes, it is common to use the signal to noise ratio measurements or geometric distances. These geometrical measurements do not include the properties of human vision system. From the literature it is approved that the metric based on the HVS are more appropriate than others [15].  
   
  4 The Human Visual System The human visual system is a complex sensory system and not yet fully mastered. Nevertheless, it may be considered an information transcription system turned into usable data by the brain (Fig. 1). A conversion step can capture the received information and decoded into signals by the brain.

  It is the role of the eye that converts light energy into sensory signals and then transmits them to the visual cortex via the optic nerves and geniculate nucleus. The visual cortex decrypts and processes the information. To better understand the flow of information and operation of the HVS, we recall the essential elements that are involved in the process of gathering and processing of visual information (Capture, conversion, transmission and processing of information). 4.1  
   
  Sensor  
   
  – The eye: Which an optical system whose primary role is to converge the light signals to the conversion zone and transmit the decoded form in the brain. It comprises several important elements including: – The cornea: is a convex spherical surface which separated the eye from the external environment. Its primary role is to focus the light rays received to the retina. – Iris: Adapts the light intensity by varying its opening. So acts as an optical diaphragm. – The crystalline: Allows to redirect the light flow to the retina where it’s arranged into photoreceptor cells (Cones and rods). It plays the role of variable focus lens. 4.2  
   
  Conversion  
   
  – The retina: It converts the light signal captured by the receiving photocells into electrical signals which are then transmitted to the visual cortex via the optic nerve. – The retina: is composed essentially of two types of receptors. – Cones: Which are responsive to detail. – Rods: Which are sensitive to low luminance (blurred vision and course) and intervene rather at night vision (monochrome). 4.3  
   
  Transmission  
   
  – The optic nerve: it transports information from the retina to the visual cortex, through the chiasm and lateral geniculation body.

  – The chiasm: the direction Information goes through from the right eye and the left eye, chiasm’s role is to transmit the information received to the lateral geniculation body. 4.4  
   
  Analysis and Decryption  
   
  – The visual cortex: His major role is the decrypting (or decoding) and the analyzing of the received signals.  
   
  5 The Human Visual System and the Perception of Visual Quality Most of the existing metrics follow the approach Top – Down to study the human visual system and imitate its behavior. The existing metrics has for objective to maximize the correlation of the results (proﬁts) of prediction with the subjective scores. The subjective evaluation of the meshing quality is established by means of observers through psychometric experiments. Many databases were developed to have measures of the real structure of the 3D meshes perceptual quality. There are two important properties of the HVS that we have to consider in order to measure the perceptual quality of the 3D meshing [16]. 5.1  
   
  Contrast Sensitivity Function  
   
  The function of spatial contrast sensitivity (notes CSF) models the sensitivity of the human visual system to spatial frequencies of the visual stimulus. The ﬁrst Research Campbell - Robson on CSF have shown that Works with the HVS selectivity on spatial frequencies, sensitivity achieved its Maximum Value around four cycles per degree of visual angle [17]. Figure 2(a) shows that the pixel intensity is modulated by a horizontal sine function. When the spatial frequency of the pixel increases in a logarithmical way (on the horizontal axis), the contrast increases from top to bottom. Although the change contrast is the same for all frequencies, we observe that the bars appear to be highest in the middle of the image following the shape of the sensitivity function in Fig. 2(b). This effect is not made by the image, it’s rather made by the property of frequency selectivity of the human vision system. In the context of dynamic visual content (2D videos, dynamic meshes, etc.), the CSF must be modulated by stimuli speed. This is due to the variability of the contrast sensitivity depending on the speed of the stimulus movement. Since 1977, Kelly has presented an experimental study for modulating the function of contrast sensitivity affected by the test conditions (see Fig. 3(a)). In 1998, Daly has developed a dynamic model of CSF through a time function of CSF tends to move to lower frequencies. These studies were performed for achromatic data. Other studies have integrated color effect on the CSF: The contrast sensitivity (Fig. 3(b)). With increasing speed, the CSF

  curve tends to shift towards low frequencies. These studies were realized to achromatic data [18]. 5.2  
   
  The Masking Effect  
   
  Masking is the effect of modiﬁcation of the component bordures visibility in a multimedia content (masked signal) by the presence of another component (masking signal). The magnitude of this effect is measured by the change of the masked signal visibility with or without the presence of the masking signal [19]. Masking may intervene in the same frequency band (in-band masking) or between different frequency bands (inter-band masking). This type of mask in literature, called the entropy masking effect [20]. There is another type of contrast masking named masking contrast connected to the

  change of the surface visibility as a function of the contrast values. The spatial masking effect is often linked to the concept of surface roughness for 3D meshes [21]. 5.3  
   
  The Perceptual Quality 3D Mesh  
   
  To measure the distance between two 3D meshes [22] many 3D metrics exist. We represent in the following sheet, the perceptual metrics developed for 3D meshes [23]. 5.3.1 The 3D Watermarking Perception Metric Corsini et al. have developed a new metric of quality [24]. Their approach, called 3DWPM (3D Watermarking Perception Metric), is based on the calculation of the perceptual distance between two meshes resting on surface roughness. This measured 3DWPM distance between two meshes M1 and M2 are identiﬁed by:  
   
  The Efﬁciency of Perceptual Quality Metrics 3D Meshes  
   
  3DWPMðM1; M2Þ ¼ logð  
   
  qðM2  qðM1Þ þ KÞ  logðkÞ qðM1Þ  
   
  503  
   
  ð1Þ  
   
  where qðM1 Þ and qðM2 Þ measure the overall roughness of the two meshes and k is a constant varied digital. Two variants of 3DWPM were developed using descriptors of roughness differences. The ﬁrst descriptor of roughness is used to 3DWPM1, is inspired by that of Lavoué [25]. The roughness measurement is calculated through measuring the dihedral angles between the normal facets in vicinity. The normal facet of a smooth surface does not vary greatly. In contrast, on textured regions (rough) these normal vary more signiﬁcantly. A Multi - scale analysis of these entities is considered [26] to evaluate dihedral angles using the direct vicinity (1 ring) and the extended vicinity (1 ring, 2 rings, etc.). The second roughness measurement adopted by Corsini et al. is 3DWPM2, it is based on estimating of the roughness of surfaces by Wang et al. [27]. Their approach is based on the comparison of a mesh and smoothed versions of the same mesh. Smooth regions correspond to small differences while the rough areas have more signiﬁcant differences. 5.3.2 The Mesh Structural Distortion Measure Metric The MSDM (Mesh Structural Distortion Measure) uses the amplitude of the average curvature of the 3D mesh surface to quantify the perceptual distortion. This metric has been improved recently under the name MSDM2 by integrating multi-scale analyses [25]. In 2006, Lavoué et al. have introduced a structured distortion measurement called Structural Mesh Distortion Measure (MSDM) [28]. This quality measure was inspired by the quality measurement of 2D pictures SSIM (Structural SIMilarity index) introduced by Corsini et al. [24]. The MSDM is based on the statistical difference of the average amplitude curves to measure the perceptual difference of two meshes. The average curvatures (CMsi) are calculated for each as the average of the minimum and maximum curvatures: CMsi ¼  
   
  ðCMsi Þ ¼ jCmin; sij þ jCmax; sij 2  
   
  ð2Þ  
   
  The amplitude of minimum and maximum curvatures (jCmin; sij and jCmax; sij) are deducted from the fair values of the curvature tensor. The approximation of the curvature tensor used, is that introduced by Cohen-Steiner et al. on spatial vicinity deﬁned by the geodesic disc resulting from the projection of a sphere of radius h on the surface of mesh. The average and standard deviation of the average curvature in a spatial window w containing n peaks, denoted respectively lw and rw are deﬁned as: 1X CMsi; si2w n rﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1X rw ¼ ðCMsi  lw Þ2 ; si2w n lw ¼  
   
  ð3Þ ð4Þ  
   
  504  
   
  N. Elloumi et al.  
   
  The covariance between the curvatures of two window s w1 and w2 of the compared meshes M1 and M2 is deﬁned as: r w1 w 2 ¼  
   
  rww11 w2 þ rww21 w2 2  
   
  ð5Þ  
   
  1 where rw w1 w2 deﬁnes the covariance calculated on the window w1:  
   
  rww11 w2 ¼  
   
       1X w1 w2  l CM  l CM w w S S2i 1 2 1i S1i 2w1 n  
   
  ð6Þ  
   
  where S2i is the nearest summit to S1i on S1i the covariance rw2 w1w2 on the window w2 is calculated in the same way. To calculate the overall distance between two meshes, MSDM based on local distances, we note MSDML: 1  
   
  MSDML ¼ ða  LðsÞa þ b  CðsÞa þ c  M ðsÞa Þa  
   
  ð7Þ  
   
  With a, b, c and a are scalars for combining different quantities. The parameters L, C, M represent respectively the differences bends, contrasts and structures measured by: LðsÞ ¼  
   
  jjlw1  lw2 jj MAX ðlw1 ; lw2 Þ jjrw1  rw2 jj MAXðrw1 ; rw2 Þ  
   
  ð9Þ  
   
  jjrw1 rw2  rw1 rw2 jj rw1 rw2  
   
  ð10Þ  
   
  Cðw1; w2Þ ¼ M ðw1; w2Þ ¼  
   
  ð8Þ  
   
  where w represents the number of local windows on mesh surfaces to compare, and a parameter that has the same value as in the Eq. 7. An improved version of MSDM named MSDM2 was proposed in 2011 by integrating a multi-scale analysis [29]. MSDM2 also compares two meshes that do not share the same connectivity through a matching step through the structure data AABB tree implemented in the CGAL [30]. We note that to establish a measure of perceptual symmetrical distance, MSDM2 calculates the average of the two distances unidirectional (respectively M1 to M2 and M2 to M1 ). MSDM and MSDM2 are based only on statistics of the curvatures magnitudes. 5.3.3 The Fast Mesh Perceptual Distance Metric In 2012, a new metric for estimating the perceptual quality was introduced par Corsini et al. [31]. It is entitled Fast Mesh Perceptual Distance (FMPD). The type of this metric is reduced-reference, it is based on the comparison of overall roughness measurements calculated on the two grids to compare. The roughness descriptor retained in FMPD is

  derived from Laplacian of the Gaussian curvature. For each summit Si the Gaussian curvature (noted CGi) is established by the following equation:   X   CGi ¼ 2p  a ð11Þ  j jN ðF Þ i  
   
  or Ni (F) represents all vicinity facets at the summit Si and the j angle aj represent the crossing facet with the actual summit. The local roughness, calculated on a top si is approximated by the quantity: P    j2Ni ðSÞ Dij CGj   RLi ¼ CGi þ  D  
   
  ð12Þ

  where Ni ðsÞ is the set of neighboring vertices aware summit, the matrix D it’s the array of discrete Laplace established by:     cot bij þ cot bij pourjNi ðsÞ Dij ¼ 2 X Dii ¼  D j ij  
   
  ð13Þ ð14Þ  
   
  where bij and bij′ are the opposite angles in which the peak relies si to sj. Figures 4(b) and (d) represent respectively the color card of the roughness measurement on the surface of the Armadillo and Venus meshes. The warm colors match at high RL values, cold colors correspond to low values of RL. We note that this descriptor is able to properly evaluate and classify the surfaces of meshes into smooth and rough areas regions. FMPD in the local roughness measurements are modulated by a power function [32] to establish local values of roughness RLFi in each peak si. This modulation is performed to capture the spatial masking effect on the mesh surfaces.

  The overall roughness is subsequently calculated by a steady sum of the local measurements: P i RLFi ai RG ¼ P ð15Þ i ai where ai is a coefﬁcient connected to the area of the incident facets at the summit si the measure of the perceptual distance FMPD is established as the difference between the values of global roughness RG1 and RG2 of two meshes M1 and M2 to compare: FMPD ¼ cjRG1  RG2 j  
   
  ð16Þ  
   
  With c as a scalar set a scale parameter for the FMPD in the interval distances [0; 1]. 5.3.4 The Dihedral Angle Mesh Error Metric Recently, Vasa and Rus have developed a new metric of perceptual quality for static 3D mesh based on the dihedral angles [33]. This metric, named DAME (Dihedral Angle Mesh Error) offers a compromise between the complexity and the prediction efﬁciency. On each pair of triangles (t1 = {S1S2S3}; t2 = {S3S2S4}) neighbors of the mesh, the dihedral angle oriented are calculated use this expression: Dt1t2¼arccosðn1;n2Þsgnðn1:ðs4s3ÞÞ  
   
  ð17Þ  
   
  where n1 and n2 represent respectively the surface normal associated with t1 and t2 triangles. Measurement of DAME perceptual distance is calculated as follows: 1 jjXjj  
   
  ð18Þ  
   
    Dt1t2  Dt2t2   mt1t2 :ðw1 þ w2 Þ  
   
  ð19Þ  
   
  DAME ¼ X ft1;t2g2X  
   
  where Dt1t2 and Dt1t2 respectively represent the measurements of the dihedral angles of the two meshes to compare, m and w represent respectively a masking modeling function and a visibility coefﬁcient.

  Abstract. In the Image Processing (IP) domain, optimization algorithms have to be applied in many cases. Nature-inspired heuristics allow obtaining near optimal solutions using lower computing resources. In this paper the Fireworks Algorithm (FWA) behavior is studied for Image Registration (IR) problems. The IR results accuracy is analyzed for different types of images, mainly in case of pixel based registration using the Normalized Mutual Information. FWA is compared to Particle Swarming (PSO), Cuckoo Search (CSA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) in terms of results accuracy and number of objective function evaluations required to obtain the optimal geometric transform parameters. Because the pixel based IR may fail in case of images containing graphic drawings, a features based IR approach is proposed for this class of images. Comparing to other nature inspired algorithms, FWA performances are close to those of PSO and CSA in terms of accuracy. Considering the required computing time, that is determined by the number of cost function evaluations, FWA is little slower than PSO and much faster than CSA and GA.

  1 Introduction Image registration (IR) is the process of geometric overlaying or alignment of two or more images of the same scene for subsequent common processing [1]. The goal of an IR procedure is to approximate the parameters of the geometric transform to be applied to a source image such that it is aligned to a model image. The overlaying quality is evaluated using a similarity criterion which must be maximized using an optimization algorithm. In case of a large number of parameters, or of complex similarity measures, the optimal parameters may be difﬁcult to obtain. Based on the strategies of live beings to survive, ﬁnd food or avoid obstacles, or modeling other natural phenomena, the nature-inspired metaheuristics offer the possibility to obtain faster a near optimal solution [2]. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E.

  A relatively new nature inspired algorithm is the Fireworks Algorithm (FWA) proposed in [3] and deeply analyzed in [4]. A detailed study and some enhancements of the operators (strategies) used in FWA are presented in [5]. Other versions of FWA are: an adaptive version of FWA proposed in [6] and a cooperative strategy among ﬁreworks in [7]. Multi-objective versions of FWA were also developed [8]. In most papers the algorithm’s performances are studied using benchmark functions. The IR issue was addressed in [9–11] using Bacterial Foraging Optimization and in [12] using Bat and Cuckoo Search algorithms. In [13] the behavior of Bacterial Foraging Optimization, Particle Swarming, Multi-swarming and Firefly algorithms in multi-threshold image segmentation was studied. In [14] single and multi-objective FWA convergence was analyzed using test functions. The paper is organized as follows. In the second section FWA is briefly described. The third section describes the IR problem and the experiments made using different types of images, including an analysis of an IR failure case. In the fourth section, the accuracy of FWA results is compared to that of the results obtained using the Particle Swarming, Cuckoo Search and Genetic Algorithms as optimization procedure. In the ﬁfth section, a features based IR approach is shortly described. It allows the registration of images that contain graphic drawings, that fails in case of pixel based registration. The last section concludes the paper.  
   
  2 Fireworks Algorithm The Fireworks Algorithm (FWA) belongs to the Swarm Intelligence algorithms category and it is inspired from the ﬁreworks explosion simulation [3, 4]. As in other swarming algorithms, the possible solutions are encoded as position of individuals that evolve in the problem domain. The evolution is simulated by selection of sparks resulted in the ﬁreworks explosion process. The objective to optimize is evaluated in all the reached positions and the best obtained position is considered as being the problem solution [14]. FWA was initially developed for single-objective optimization problems, in which the parameter value that minimize (or maximize) a ﬁtness function have to be determined: minx2S f ð xÞ  
   
  ð1Þ  
   
  where S is the problem domain (constraints). FWA is an iterative algorithm which starts with a set of individuals (ﬁreworks) randomly placed in the problem domain. For each iteration (epoch) of FWA, a variable number of descendants (sparks) is generated for each ﬁrework. The descendants are evaluated and some of them became ﬁreworks in the next evolution step  (epoch).  Let’s consider X ¼ fxi ; i ¼ 1; . . .N g a set of N ﬁreworks, and xi ¼ x1i ; . . .; xdi their positions in the problem domain, where d is the dimension of the problem.

  The general structure of the algorithm is described below [4]:  
   
  Each step of the FWA loop involves strategies that are important for the algorithm’s performances. The ﬁreworks explosion which ensures the quality of the next ﬁreworks generation is characterized by strength, amplitude and displacement. The explosion strength refers to the number of sparks Si of each ﬁrework. It depends on the current ﬁrework quality, and it is computed as: fworst  f ðxi Þ þ e Si ¼ m  Pn 1 ðfworst  f ðxi ÞÞ þ e  
   
  ð2Þ  
   
  where m is the total number of sparks, fworst is the worst ﬁtness value of the current ﬁreworks set, f ðxi Þ is the ﬁtness value of the ith ﬁrework and e is a constant used to avoid zero-division operations. To keep the number of sparks in a reasonable interval, minimum and maximum values that depend on m are imposed for Si . The amplitude Ai of the ith ﬁrework sparks is used to avoid the convergence to local solutions. The amplitude is higher as the distance to the best ﬁrework increases and it is computed as: f ðxi Þ  fbest þ e Ai ¼ A  Pn 1 ðf ðxi Þ  fbest Þ þ e  
   
  ð3Þ  
   
  where A is the desired sum of amplitudes, fbest is the best ﬁtness value in the current ﬁreworks set. Two types of sparks are created in the ith ﬁrework explosion: regular and Gaussian. Regular sparks are obtained from the parent ﬁrework by adding a uniform random number in the interval ðAi ; Ai Þ to some randomly chosen coordinates. xki ¼ xki þ U  
   
  ð4Þ  
   
  where k are the randomly chosen coordinates and U is the uniform random value.  
   
  512  
   
  S.-I. Bejinariu et al.  
   
  The Gaussian sparks assure the diversity of the next ﬁreworks generation by altering some randomly chosen coordinates of some randomly chosen ﬁreworks by random numbers with Gaussian distribution: xki ¼ xki  g  
   
  ð5Þ  
   
  where k are the randomly chosen coordinates and g are random numbers. If the generated sparks are placed outside the problem domain they must be re-positioned inside. The ﬁtness function is evaluated in the all new sparks and the next generation ﬁreworks population is selected. The best, the worst and the other N  2 randomly chosen ﬁreworks replace the population of ﬁreworks.  
   
  3 FWA Based Image Registration Image registration is the process of geometric overlaying or alignment of two or more images of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors [1]. There are two different approaches of IR: pixel level and features level registration. In both cases, IR is an optimization procedure because it requires to approximate the parameters of a geometric transform which applied to a source image minimize a similarity measure computed between the transformed source image and a model image. In the FWA based IR the possible solutions are encoded as positions of the ﬁreworks and the objective to optimize is the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). The ﬁreworks evolve in a multidimensional space whose dimension is equal to the number of parameters in the geometric transform to be approximated. In the next paragraphs the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) is also used to evaluate the results, but it is not used as optimization criteria. The FWA based IR procedure was evaluated using the images available in the ‘Miscellaneous’ volume of USC-SIPI database [15]. All used images were resized to 256  256 resolution, and color depth was reduced to 256 gray levels if not already so. In the following paragraphs the results obtained using four model images from this database are presented. Two of these images contain photos (Fig. 1a and b), one contains graphics (Fig. 1c) and the last one is mixed (Fig. 1d).

  The source images were artiﬁcially generated by applying to model images an afﬁne transform with the following parameters: rotation by h ¼ 10 against the rotation center cx ¼ 30; cy ¼ 30 and scaling by the factor s ¼ 0:8. The computed inverse afﬁne transform has the following parameters: rotation by h0 ¼ 10 against the same center and scaling factor s0 ¼ 1:250. FWA was applied to register the source images (Fig. 2) to model images (Fig. 1). The parameters of the algorithm were chosen as follows: – – – – – –  
   
  ﬁtness function: NMI, number of epochs = 250, number of ﬁreworks = 5, maximum amplitude = 40, regular sparks factor = 10 and number of Gaussian sparks = 5.  
   
  These values of FWA parameters were chosen accordingly to those proposed in [4] and they were validated by our experiments. Because optimal value of NMI is unknown, there was no stop criterion other than the number of epochs. It must be noticed that the ﬁtness function evaluation requires to apply the approximated geometric transform that correspond to the ﬁrework position and then to compute the similarity measure between the model image and transformed source image. This evaluation is time consuming; in fact more than 90% of IR execution time is spent in the ﬁtness function evaluation [10].

  Even if the number of individuals (ﬁreworks) and iteration (epochs) are reduced comparing to other nature-inspired IR procedures, the results are quite good. The ﬁnal results evaluation is performed using two different similarity measures: NMI and NCC. The columns named Expected contain the NMI/NCC values computed between the model image and source image transformed using the computed inverse transform. The columns named Approximated contain the NMI/NCC values computed between the model image and source image transformed using the approximated inverse transform. The column ‘#evals’ contains the total number of cost function evaluations, column ‘Best eval’ the number of the evaluation in which the best ﬁtness was reached and the last column contains the execution time in seconds – not so relevant while it depends on computer’s performances.

  By analyzing the values in Tables 1 and 2, the following conclusions can be drawn: – In most cases the approximated value of the similarity measure is greater than the expected value. This can be explained by the two geometric transforms applied to the image which means that pixels values were interpolated two times. – The parameters of the approximated inverse transform (Table 2) are very close to those of the computed inverse. – In case of ‘Ruler’ image the registration process failed. The cause is discussed below. – The best value was obtained enough late in the iterative process, which means that better solutions can be obtained by increasing the number of iterations. Regarding the number of epochs and number of ﬁreworks used in FWA it must be said that a reduced number of ﬁreworks (3 or 4) requires a considerably increase of the number of epochs in order to obtain similar results. By increasing the number of epochs and keeping constant the number of ﬁreworks (=5), the results are improved but not signiﬁcantly while the processing time greatly increases. – The application was tested on an Intel Core i3, 2.4 GHz, 6 GB RAM based computer. The execution time is presented for the case of parallel execution. Even if not present in the Table 1, the sequential execution time is about 30% greater with the observation that other applications were running in the same time.

  IR Failure Analysis  
   
  As it was seen above, the IR of ‘Ruler’ image failed. Let’s analyze the histograms of the four images (Fig. 4). Only 5 levels of gray are used in the ‘Ruler’ image, most of them corresponding to the image background. By applying the afﬁne transform to the model, most pixels have the same or close values to those in the original, leading to small variations of the similarity measure. This is visible in Fig. 5 which contains for all images the variation of NMI depending on the rotation angle and scale factor, keeping the rotation center ﬁxed and equal to the values determined in the computed inverse transform. The peak of NMI surface is visible for all images, but the variation is steep close to the maximum value in case of ‘Ruler’ while the growth is smoother for the other images. It must be speciﬁed also that these surfaces have about 400 local maximum values in case of ‘Lena’ and ‘Peppers’, 122 local maximum in case of ‘Testpat’ and about 1040 maximum values in case of ‘Ruler’. Considering the fact that during evolution only 5 ﬁreworks are used, it is understandable why the algorithm converges to a local solution. In fact, because the initial positions are randomly chosen, for repeated executions of IR procedure on ‘Testpat’ image, in about 10% of cases the algorithm leads to the correct solution.

  The easiest solution to solve these failures is to change the algorithm’s parameters. The attempt to increase the number of iterations (epochs) to 500 or 1000 did not lead to the expected result, because it depends on the spatial distribution of the initial population. By increasing the number of ﬁreworks in the initial population to 10 or 15, the percent of cases in which the algorithm leads to the correct solution has increased to about 25%. In our opinion, both these parameters must be increased, even if this solution is not feasible because the execution time increases also. Another solution of this problem is the usage of features based IR. Some results are shortly described later in the ﬁfth section. 3.2  
   
  Image Registration of Noise Affected Images  
   
  The behavior of the FWA based IR procedure was studied also for noise affected images. The source images were warped using the same afﬁne transform described in the previous section and then they were degraded using Gaussian or Salt & Pepper noise. The degraded source images were registered to the original model images. Image degradation is evaluated using the Signal-To-Noise ratio (Table 3). The objective evaluation of IR results is presented in Tables 4 and 5 and the processed images are presented in Fig. 6. The conclusion that can be drawn is that the registration process is not affected by the degradation of images, but depends on the similarity measure used as objective function in the optimization. In fact this demonstrates that the procedure can be applied for multimodal images.

  4 FWA Versus Other Optimization Algorithms The accuracy of the image registration results is compared to that obtained using other optimization algorithms: Particle Swarming (PSO), Cuckoo Search (CSA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The PSO implementation described in [13] was customized for IR with the following parameters: number of particles – 100, number of iterations – 100, inertia weight – 0.729, local weight – 1.4945 and global weight – 1.4945. The weights are those proposed in [16]. Our experiments demonstrated that even small variations of these values decrease the results accuracy. The CSA based IR procedure [12] was used with the following parameters: number of nests – 25, number of iterations – 1000 and discovery rate – 0.25. For GA based IR an implementation based on real encoding (each chromosome is characterized by real values representing the geometric transform parameters) was used [17]. Discrete, average and simplex crossover operators were applied with different probabilities. The GA was applied as in [17] using the following parameters: number of generations – 500, number of chromosomes – 1500, probability of discrete crossover – 0.05, probability of average crossover – 0.15, probability of simplex crossover – 0.2 and mutation rate – 0.2. The IR procedure was applied using all these optimization algorithms on the same images as in the previous section. The obtained results are described in Table 6. Both NMI and NCC values are presented but NMI was used as objective function to be maximized. The maximum values of NMI are embossed for each image case. Table 6.

  The same results are graphically presented for each test image in Fig. 7. The values presented in Fig. 7 have been rounded to three decimal digits. For this reason, in some graphs the values are equal but the corresponding bars have different heights. A brief analysis of these results leads to the following conclusions: – First of all, it must be noticed that in case of ‘Ruler’ test image the registration fails also in case of PSO, CSA and GA optimization, – All four optimization algorithms produce enough good results for three test images: ‘Lena’, ‘Peppers’ and ‘Testpat’. – CSA offers the best results for all four images. In fact, also for ‘Ruler’ test image, FWA, PSO and GA produce a result similar to that presented in Fig. 3c, while CSA

  tends to approximate the inverse geometric transform. The ‘scale’ and ‘angle’ parameters are enough well approximated, only the rotation center coordinates are pretty much shifted from the expected values. It is possible that an increased number of iterations and/or an increased number of host nests allow CSA to obtain a better solution. – The results obtained by using GA in optimization are less accurate than the other three algorithms results. – The accuracy of results obtained by using PSO and FWA is good even if lower than CSA results accuracy. The PSO, CSA and GA based IR procedures were applied also for the images altered by Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noise with quite similar results. A complete analysis of the registration results have to consider also the processing time which is determined by the number of objective function evaluations. As it was already noticed in the previous section, in case of pixel based IR applications, more than 90% of the processing time is spent in these evaluations, so, reducing them may be important at least for real time applications. In Fig. 8, the average number of objective function evaluations is presented. On the other hand, the number of evaluations required to obtain the best solution is important given the fact that this class of algorithms usually obtain the best solution during the evolution but not necessary in the last iteration. As is depicted in Fig. 8, FWA and PSO use a lower number of cost function evaluations, while GA uses the greatest number while its results are less accurate. Concerning the number of cost function evaluations required to obtain the best solution,  
   
  520  
   
  S.-I. Bejinariu et al.  
   
  Fig. 8. Average number of objective function evaluations  
   
  it must be noticed that in case of FWA, PSO and CSA it is close to the total number of evaluations. This leads to the conclusion that more precise solutions can be obtained by increasing the number of iterations and/or individuals used in the evolutionary process. A different situation is encountered in case of GA. Its best solutions are obtained after about 8–9000 cost function evaluations, i.e. about one eight of the total number which is lower than in case of the other algorithms. This means that GA optimization represents a good choice if less accurate solutions are acceptable. As a conclusion, CSA can be used to obtain more precise solutions; GA can be used to faster obtain an acceptable solution; FWA and PSO is the proper choice if good solutions have to be also quickly obtained.  
   
  5 Pixel Based Versus Features Based IR We still have to ﬁnd a solution to register images that contain graphic drawings, like the ‘Ruler’ test image. A good solution is the usage of features based IR. In this case, distinctive and stable features (points, lines, contours, regions) have to be detected in both model and source images. A features based IR procedure using bio-inspired computing is presented in [17]. As features the key-points determined using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) [18] are used. To evaluate images similarity, the correspondences between features present in both images have to be identiﬁed. The Euclidean distances between SIFT descriptors are computed for all key-points pairs detected in the model and source images. For each key-point descriptor in the model image, the distances to the key-points descriptors in the source image are sorted in ascendant order. If the smallest distance is less than a speciﬁc percent (usually 30%) of the second distance then a match is established between the key-point in the model image and the key-point in the source image [17]. The registration procedures are similar excepting the objective function used in optimization. In case of features based IR the Euclidean distance between the positions of the common features in the two images is used for images similarity evaluation. It must be noticed also that in this case the geometric transform corresponding to each  
   
  Fireworks Algorithm Based Image Registration  
   
  521  
   
  possible solution have to be applied only for the key-points coordinates while in the pixel based IR, the entire source image have to be transformed. This explains why the features based IR is much faster than pixel based IR. In fact, increasing the number of iterations and/or individuals does not have a great impact on the processing time. However, features based IR has one great disadvantage. For multimodal or some noise affected images the correspondences between stable features in the two images can’t be established. Trying to register images that contain graphic drawings (‘Ruler’ image), the four optimization algorithms were applied for features based IR using the SIFT key-points. A number of 2607 stable features were determined in the model image and 2525 stable features were determined in the source image. From these only for 60 pairs of key-points the correspondence was established and they were used in registration. The image registration succeeded for all algorithms. As depicted in Fig. 9, the best registration accuracy is obtained when FWA was used as optimization algorithm but also the others produce enough good results. Concerning the number of objective function evaluations it is similar to that of pixel based IR, because the parameters chosen for the optimization algorithms were the same. Anyway this is less important because the IR is very fast. As comparison, the duration of IR procedure applied for the ‘Lena’ image and FWA usage in optimization, on a system equipped with an Intel Core i5 3.1 GHz processor and 4 GB RAM, is shown in Table 7.

  The features based IR was applied also for the images degraded using Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noise. In the ﬁrst case the features based IR succeeded as well even if fewer correspondences were found in the two images. In the second case, the

  6 Conclusions In this paper, the behavior of the Fireworks optimization algorithm for image registration problems is analyzed. Both pixel based and features based image registration were addressed for different types of images: pictures, graphics and a combination of these. In most cases the optimization algorithm is chosen and its parameters are tuned depending on the problem to be solved. FWA is compared to other nature inspired evolutionary algorithms: Particle Swarming, Cuckoo Search and Genetic algorithms. Concerning the pixel based IR, for which the Normalized Mutual Information was used as objective function, FWA may be a choice if enough good registration results have to be obtained in a reasonable execution time because the accuracy of its results is almost as good as for PSO and CSA algorithms and better than those of GA usage. Regarding the number of objective function evaluations that is proportional to the execution time, in the studied cases FWA is almost as fast as PSO is and much faster than CSA and GA. Similar results were obtained for images degraded by noise. The pixel based registration may fail if the images to be registered contain graphics. For this reason a features based IR approach is also analyzed. It is based on the SIFT features and FWA offers more accurate results than PSO, CSA and GA optimization algorithms. The features based IR has the disadvantage that it might fail for multi-modal or noise affected images, because the correspondences between the stable features detected in the two images can’t be found. The results presented in this paper were obtained using FWA, PSO, CSA and GA implementations in C++ [9–14]. The parallel implementation uses the computing power of multi-core processors and was developed using the parallel computing support of the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 framework. The OpenCV open-source library was used for images manipulation. The graphs presented in Fig. 5 were drawn using a Matlab application. This research will be continued by the analysis of other nature-inspired optimization algorithms and their usage in image processing applications.

  Abstract. The large volume of medical images remains a major problem for their archiving and transmission. In this context, we propose a novel protocol wavREPro that aims to minimize the image size before its storage and then to enlarge it at reception. This process has been achieved by exploiting the Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) namely Haar, Le Gall (5/3) and Daubechies (9/7) wavelets. These tools represent the image in the multi-resolution domain that follows the human psycho-visual system. Therefore, the reduced image is none other than the approximation of the image. Its magniﬁcation is carried out by either cancelling the details (wavREProZ) or estimating them (wavREProED) using the DWT−1 on the reduced image. Our experiments have been conducted on a PET (Positron Emission Tomography) medical image database and the results have been presented for the three well-known color spaces RGB, HSV and YCbCr. The reported results have promoted the wavREProZ application with the Haar wavelets on RGB images since it achieved maximum ﬁdelity between the original and reduced then enlarged images. The good performance of this approach encourages its adoption to display images on screens having diﬀerent sizes.

  Introduction  
   
  The reduction and expansion of digital images are current, useful and even necessary operations in many applications related to the imaging domain especially in the medical ﬁeld [7,14]. In fact, the big size of medical images [4,24] make their transmission and archiving quite diﬃcult due to the limitation of both the hard drive capacity and the transfer rate [10]. The only possible solution to overcome this problem is to reduce the size of these ﬁles by compression techniques c Springer International Publishing AG 2018  V.E. Balas et al.

  such as JPEG [11], JPEG 2000 [34], Fractal coding methods [6], Region of Interest Coding Techniques [12,17], Lossless dynamic and adaptive compression [9], low-complexity compression [29] and genetic algorithms [33] and REPro (Reduction/Expansion Protocol) [2]. In this work, we are interested in REPro [11] that compresses images by reducing their deﬁnition (pixel number). In this context, various methods have been developed such as the decimation by square-square mesh [15], the decimation from a square mesh to a staggered mesh [28] and the decimation from a staggered mesh to a square mesh. On the other hand, the enlargement process is required to access to the image details. It can also be used to increase the resolution of the image in the same spatial support to improve the visual comfort of the viewer. In the literature, diﬀerent techniques have been utilized for enlarging color images [27] namely the zero-padding [26], the polynomial nearest neighbor [32], the linear, quadratic and cubic interpolations and the cardinal spline transformation [13]. In our research, a novel approach has been developed to reduce and enlarge PET (Positron Emission Tomography) images. We have exploited the image multiresolution representation using Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWTs) [8, 16,19,25,30] in the reduction and expansion phases. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is reserved to the presentation of our new approach wavREPro and its two versions. In this part, we also present an overview about the diﬀerent used tools which are the DWTs and the image quality metrics. Section 3 presents our experimental results and their assessments. In the last section (Sect. 4), we summarize the main contributions of our work.

  Proposed Approach Medical Context  
   
  Telemedicine is an eﬀective solution to remedy the lack of medical specialists and equipment. Indeed, thanks to this technology, it is possible to exchange information having diﬀerent sizes and natures between a tele-staﬀ. This fact requires the adaptation of the image size to the screen size mainly when displaying medical images [20]. However, these images are usually large which can slow the communication. Furthermore, to display these images, they must also be adapted to the resolution of the screens [31]. In this context, REPro permits the reduction of the image deﬁnition that speeds its transmission. On the other hand, this protocol can enlarge the transferred image to ensure more visual comfort or it may further reduce the image deﬁnition to be adaptable to the low resolutions of some display devices such as tablets and smart phones (Fig. 1). 2.2  
   
  Methodology  
   
  To reduce or to enlarge the image, we have chosen to transform the image to the multiresolution domain to beneﬁt from its simultaneous spatial and frequency locations. This process is carried out by the use of the Discrete Wavelet Transforms (Fig. 2).

  Where “ori.Im” is the original image, DWT is the Discrete Wavelet Transforms, LUT is the Look-Up Table, RI is the reduced image, RILUT is the approximation space related to the applied DWT, REI is the reduced then enlarged image. 2.2.1 Used Wavelet Transforms Wavelets are interesting tools as they provide a simultaneous frequency and spatial locations of the image. This feature following the human psychovisual model allows wavelets to be exploited in various image processing applications such as compression (JPEG 2000), ﬁltering [3], segmentation [5] and watermarking [19]. To apply a DWT on an image, we simply utilized it on lines then on columns. The original image was ﬁrst decomposed into an approximation Ap0 and 3 detail sub images called HD0 , VD0 and DD0 which denoted Horizontal Details, Vertical Details and Diagonal details, respectively [23]. The recursive application of wavelets yielded the representation of the image in the multiresolution domain at level n as shown in Fig. 3. The level n denoted the number of iterations of the application of wavelets.

  In this work, three well-known transforms were exploited. In fact, the Haar wavelet was used for its simple implementation [22]. Moreover, we utilized Le Gall 5/3 and Daubechies 9/7 wavelets due to their frequent usages in the JPEG 2000 compression standard. The equations of Haar, 5/3 et 9/7 DWTs are depicted in Eqs. 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  s[n] = 12 (s0 [n] + d0 [n]) (1) d[n] = 12 (s0 [n] − d0 [n])    d[n] = d0 [n] - 12 (s0 [n + 1] + s0 [n]) (2)   s[n] = s0 [n] + 14 (d[n] + d[n - 1]) + 12  1  ((s0 [n + 2] + s0 [n − 1]) − 9 (s0 [n + 1] + s0 [n])) + 12 d[n] = d0 [n] + 16   s[n] = s0 [n] + 14 (d[n] + d[n - 1]) + 12 (3) where s0 and d0 are the initial approximation and details and s and d are the new approximation and details. Figure 4 illustrated the image decompositions in one level and two level after the application of the 5/3 wavelet on an original color image (Fig. 4a).

  2.2.2 The WavREPro Protocol The wavREPro protocol (or “Reduction/Expansion Protocol based on wavelets”) exploited the DWTs not only to reduce the image but also to enlarge it. Two versions of this protocol were proposed (Fig. 5). On the one hand, we obtained wavREProZ when the wavREPro protocol used Zero details. On the other hand, wavREProED represented wavREPro using enlarged details. These two approaches used the same reduction process that involved DWTs. This aimed to get the approximation on which we applied a Look-Up Table (LUT) [1] transform before its transmission to respect the image coding standards. We explain below the expansion process of wavREProZ and wavREProED.

  2.2.2.1 The wavREProZ Protocol When the user received the reduced image (RI), it applied on it a color palette (Look-Up Table: LUT). This table was based on linear functions to make the values in accordance with the approximation space related to the applied DWT. The resulting matrix was called RILUT. We associated to this matrix 3 zero matrices having the same dimensions as RILUT. These matrices were considered as matrices of Horizontal Details (HD = 0), Vertical Details (VD = 0) and Diagonal Details (DD = 0). Finally, DWT−1 was applied on the set {RILUT, HD = 0, VD = 0, DD = 0} to get the reduced then enlarged image using wavREProZ and we named it REI-wavZ (Fig. 6).

  2.2.2.2 The wavREProED Protocol This protocol tried to ﬁnd the vertical (VD), horizontal (HD) and diagonal (DD) details lost in the reduction phase. This process was carried out in two phases. In fact, the DWT was applied on the reduced image as illustrated in Fig. 7. Then, the DWT−1 is carried out on each of the Horizontal Details HDR, Vertical Details VDR and Diagonal Details DDR of the reduced mage (RI). To compute one of these components, the other components should be cancelled as described in Fig. 8. Thus, to estimate a detail component, we have enlarged its counter-parts obtained from the application of the DWT on the reduced image while respecting the frequency location of these details.

  Finally, to get the image enlarged by the wavREProED protocol, we have adapted the reduced image RI to the approximation space related to the used DWT to obtain the same image RILUT used by wavREProZ. The magniﬁed image (REI-wavED) is obtained by applying the DWT−1 on the set {RILUT, HD, VD, DD} as illustrated in Fig. 9. 2.2.3 Image Quality Metrics The image quality metrics were considered in our experiments to assess the level of distortion introduced by the reduction-expansion process. In this work, we used the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) to get an objective evaluation of the performance of the proposed approaches.

  2.2.3.1 Structural SIMilarity The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index is a method for measuring the similarity between two images where we focus on the structure image ﬁdelity. The SSIM [18] is expressed by Eq. 4. SSIM (x, y) =  
   
  (2μx μy + C1 )(2σxy + C2 ) (μ2x + μ2y + C1 )(σx2 + σy2 + C2 )  
   
  (4)  
   
  C1 = (K1 L)2 , C2 = (K2 L)2 where μx and μx denote the average values of the images X and Y respectively, σx and σy are the standard deviations (the square root of variance) of X and Y σxy is the covariance of X and Y. L is the dynamic range of the pixel values (255 for the images encoded on 8 bits) and C1 and C2 are small positive constants (K1 and K2  1). At each pixel (i, j), a local SSIM (i, j) index is deﬁned by evaluating the average, the standard deviation and the covariance on a local neighbor around that pixel (i, j). The overall quality of the image is measured by the Means SSIM index (MSSIM) which is expressed by Eq. 5. M SSIM =  
   
  1  SSIM (i, j) M i j  
   
  (5)  
   
  where M is the total number of local SSIM indices. 2.2.3.2 Peak Signal Noise Ratio The PSNR quantiﬁes the image distortion in decibel (dB) [21]. It is a function of the Mean Square Error (MSE). Equations 6 and 7 describe the MSE and PSNR metrics, respectively. n  m    ∗ 2 Iij − Iij M SE =  
   
  i=1 j=1  
   
  (6)  
   
  nm 2  
   
  P SN R (I, I ∗ ) = 10 log 10(X max /M SE(I, I ∗ )) where I and I* are images having the same size n × m.

  When a PSNR is upper than or equal to 30 dB, it reﬂects an acceptable image degradation. From 60 dB, it represents an imperceptible image distortion. 2.2.3.3 Selection Rate The quantiﬁcation of the distortion introduced by two methods on an image database was generally carried out according results provided by P SN Raverage and SSIMaverage . However, if the P SN Raverage of the ﬁrst approach is higher than that of the second method, this fact does not prove that the ﬁrst approach introduces less distortion on each image of the database. To get a more objective assessment, we introduced the concept of selection rate. Hence, the selection rate of the method 1 was simply the percentage of the images of the database where this method introduced less distortion compared to the second method. Considering this deﬁnition, we obtained selection rates based on PSNR and SSIM to evaluate the performances of the approaches on our image database.

  Experiments and Discussion  
   
  We proposed to evaluate the performance of our two approaches wavREProZ and wavREproED and to analyze the impact of each color space (RGB, HSV, YCbCr) and each adopted wavelet on the reduction-expansion process. Our experiments were conducted on 30 PET images. Initially, we were interested in assessing the performance of each wavREPro version when the images were represented in the RGB color space. The reported results in Fig. 10 and Table 1 obviously showed that the adoption of the Haar wavelet in wavREPro yielded two diﬀerent performances n terms of PSNR and SSIM. Indeed, the use of this wavelet in the wavREProZ process, hence its name wavHaarZ, ensured the best degree of similarity between the original and reduced then enlarged images. However, the same wavelet caused the most image quality degradation when it was used in the wavREProED method, hence its name wavHaarED. In addition, we noted that PSNRs obtained after the application of 5/3 and 9/7 wavelets on PET images were very close (Fig. 10a). However, the results shown in Fig. 10b promoted the utilization of the 9/7 wavelet followed by the 5/3 wavelet in terms of SSIM. Thus, the Haar wavelet improved the performance of wavREProZ while it was preferable to use wavREProED with the 9/7 or 5/3 wavelets (Table 1). Where wav5/3Z and wav5/3ED denoted the 5/3 wavelets applied in wavREProZ and wavREProED, respectively. Similarly, wav9/7Z and wav9/7ED represented the 9/7 wavelets applied in wavREProZ and wavREProED, respectively. The results provided by Table 2 conﬁrmed the values of PSNR and SSIM. Indeed, wavHaarZ was selected as the best technique of reduction-expansion for all the PET images of the database when the color space was RGB.

  In order to evaluate the performances of wavREProZ and wavREProED and the impact of the choice of wavelets on the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) image quality, we converted the test images to this color space. Then, these images were reduced then enlarged. Finally, they were converted back to the RGB space. We exploited PSNR, SSIM and selection rates to illustrate the eﬀect of the reduction operation followed by the image magniﬁcation process. The results presented in Fig. 11 and Table 3 proved again that wavReproZ based on Haar wavelet transforms performed better in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Similarly to the results attained in the RGB color space, the Haar wavelet had the greatest performance when we adopted it in wavREProZ. But, contrary to the results provided in the RGB color space, wavREProED based on wavHaarED seemed more eﬃcient than wavREProED based on the 9/7 wavelets. Indeed, wavHaarED performed better than wav9/7ED for 20% of the database images in terms of PSNR and reached even 26.6% of this set in terms of SSIM (Table 4).

  We also carried out our experiments on our test images that we converted to the YCbCr color space. Figure 12 illustrated the degree of resemblance between the original and reduced then enlarged images. The performances of the diﬀerent methods were summarized in Table 5. According to Fig. 11a, we clearly noticed that PSNRs are higher than 30 dB for all the applied methods. In other words, there was a good conservation of the content of all the images. Table 5.

  On the other hand, we noted that PSNR and SSIM reached great values when wav9/7ED was adopted (Table 5). Moreover, the 5/3 wavelet provided the second best performance followed by the Haar wavelet. Therefore, wav9/7ED was obviously selected as the best technique since it ensured the most image content preservation (Table 6). Table 6.

  Finally, we noted that the Haar wavelet always gave the best results when it was included in wavREProZ whereas the 9/7 and 5/3 wavelets performed better when used in the wavREProED protocol. To highlight the impact of the space color choice on the wavREPro performance, we compared the best wavREPro approaches selected by each color space. This leaded us to compare the performances of wavHaarZ applied in RGB and HSV color spaces to those of wav9/7ED utilized in the YCbCr color space. Figure 13 and Tables 7 and 8 showed the performance assessments of methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. We noted that RGB represented the best color space to adopt and that is why it was selected for all images (Fig. 13 and Tables 9 and 10).

  Conclusion  
   
  In this paper, we presented a new approach of reduction and enlargement called wavREPro that exploited the image representation in the multiresolution domain. This ﬁeld provided simultaneously the spatial and frequency locations of the image and followed the human psycho-visual model. The transition to this domain was achieved using the Discrete Wavelet Transforms. In this context, we used three types of DWTs namely Haar, Le Gall (5/3) and Daubechies (9/7) wavelets. These methods allowed the reduction of the image before its storage or transfer then its enlargement before its display on the screen. The minimized image was none other than the approximation that was the result of the DWT application on the image to transfer. To enlarge the image, we proposed two versions of wavREPro which added details to the obtained approximation and then applied the DWT−1 on the 4 components. The wavREPoZ version canceled details while the wavREProED version estimated the details of the image transformed to the multiresolution domain. The performances of these diﬀerent approaches were assessed in diﬀerent color spaces namely RGB, HSV and YCbCr. The obtained results promoted the use of the Haar wavelet, which canceled the details in the image magniﬁcation process. We also noted that it was appropriate to exploit the RGB space color for the application of wavREPro on PET images. In addition, it was obviously noted that the Haar wavelet was more eﬀective when used in wavREProZ while wavREProED achieved good results when the 5/3 and 9/7 wavelets were utilized. This work has been exploited to reduce images before their storage or transfer. In addition, our approach has ensured their adaption to the diﬀerent types of screens before their display. This can be carried out by resizing the image to ﬁt appropriately the screen size.

  Abstract. Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) is a practical tool offering the possibility of extracting characteristics from images, a transformation which has good directional selectivity, is approximately shift invariant and it is computationally efﬁcient. DTCWT may be employed in different stages of image processing, including multiscale texture featuring. We are measuring texture similarities on characteristics vectors by applying cosine, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, entropy-based and histogram related distances and we tested these measures on slightly rotated samples from Brodatz texture album. Comparisons and observations are made on the methods that we employed. Keywords: Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform Similarity measures  Texture

  1 Introduction Understanding images is a complex process which implies training during long periods of time in order to use high amounts of accumulated knowledge. To recognize images similar to those that we are acquainted to, we are scaling them and situating them in environmental contexts, in order to place the objects from the image in an appropriate scenario. As human beings we are merely evaluating colors, textures, lines, shapes, shades and lights, materials and spatial positioning, while a computer needs a large variety of mathematical models attempting to represent the cognitive processes in order to obtain comparable results. Intelligent agent architectures aim to adapt to each special task apparently simple for human eye-brain chain which in fact is a very complex paradigm. Image features are extracted and decomposed in hierarchical stages, color and texture being characterized by complex mathematical methods. Texture characterization is important in many domains, among them being the medical imaging evaluation and interpretation, industrial applications, remote sensing, etc. [1–4]. With the actual amazing increase of the internet image databases it is essential in automatic object retrieval to have a good texture identiﬁcation procedure. The texture featuring and analysis with a relatively new mathematical tool, the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform DTCWT [5, 6], is discussed in our paper. Note that the DTCWT is abbreviated with an italic C to differ from the Continuous Wavelet Transform. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018 V.E. Balas et al.

  We used the classic Brodatz album with texture images [7] and some images from our experimental database. Texture features were computed using the six directional coefﬁcients provided by DTCWT applied on all these texture images and their rotated versions, as we will further explain. In order to identify a certain texture in an area of an image, we apply several distances (cosine, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, entropy-based and histogram related) on the extracted features.  
   
  2 Disadvantages of Wavelet Transforms The main disadvantages of (real) wavelet transform [8, 9] are: oscillations around singularities (1), shift variance (2), aliasing (3) and the lack of directionality (4). These issues can be overcome by using Complex Wavelets. Yet, it is difﬁcult to compute complex wavelets satisfying the perfect reconstruction property. In [5, 6], Kingsbury introduced the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) which is a new way of computing complex wavelets with perfect reconstruction with a 2d:1 redundancy for d dimensional signals. Important aspects about computing DTCWT, its properties and possible applications were developed in [9–11].  
   
  3 Discussion on Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform The decimated Discrete Wavelet Transform [12] has two major inconveniences: shift variance (small shifts in the input signal can generate big variations in the wavelet coefﬁcients) and reduced directional selectivity (especially in diagonal directions). To overcome these limitations one can use complex wavelets. The difﬁculty in computing complex wavelets is given by the problem of designing perfectly reconstructed ﬁlter banks beyond the ﬁrst level of decomposition. The problem was solved by Kingsbury [5, 6]. He developed the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform, which provides approximate shift invariance, good directional selectivity, uses short linear phase ﬁlters with perfect reconstruction and has efﬁcient computation costs (O(N) for 1D-signals). The toll to be paid for these properties is increased redundancy (2:1 for 1D-signals, 4:1 for 2D signals, 8:1 for 3D, and so on) but still it is much less than the undecimated wavelet transform. In order to obtain approximate shift invariance for the decimated DWT, one must double the sample rate at each level of decomposition; this is equivalent with having two parallel fully decimated trees and also the ﬁlters at level 1 must be delayed by one sample. After level 1, to reestablish the uniform interval sampling, one must work with odd length ﬁlter on one tree and even length ﬁlter on the other. In order to have a better symmetry between the trees odd and even ﬁlters must alternate when changing the decomposition level. The output obtained from the two parallel trees can be interpreted as the real and the imaginary parts of the complex wavelet coefﬁcients. In order to compute CWT for 2D signals, each level of decomposition contains two stages: one consists in ﬁltering the rows and the second stage is to ﬁlter the result along columns.

  When applied to digital images the DTCWT yields at each level of decomposition six bandpasses sub-images of complex coefﬁcients. These sub-images provide strong directional selectivity at angles ±15º, ±45º, and ±75º. For feature extraction the energy, the mean, the standard deviation, the entropy of the six complex directional coefﬁcients (or their amplitude) yielded by the DTCWT are usually employed: in [13, 14] they use energy and standard deviation, [15] works with the mean, the standard deviation of the amplitude of the sub-band images, and [16] employs the mean and the entropy. In [17] features were extracted using a threshold for counting the signiﬁcant elements of the DTCWT coefﬁcients. In [8, 18, 19], rotation invariant features were designed using DTCWT. In our paper, we study the influence of rotation and of changing the brightness of images (by applying a c transformation) over the DTCWT coefﬁcients. As features we use the histograms of the DTCWT directional sub-images. For comparisons, we employed ten similarity measures for probability density functions presented in [20] and for classiﬁcation we used the minimum-distance classiﬁer and SVM (Support Vector Machine) [21].  
   
  4 Texture Features Selected with DTCWT Due to the exponentially growing amount of digital images, each new aspect has to be taken into account to facilitate the automatic image classiﬁcation and clustering. In order to group the photos in classes depicting the same scene, it is possible to extract by means of segmentation some texture samples from each image. We might classify the image to a certain class by taking into account the information provided by the retrieved dominant textures. In order to identify textures, we extract feature vectors and we match the texture from the image with textures from a database. We tested some similarity measures in order to compare the textures of the test images with those from the database. The class in which we introduce the test image is the one that gives most matches. We study in this paper the effect of rotation on classiﬁcation process using DTCWT for feature extraction and we proposed some similarity measures. As an example, Fig. 1 is presenting an image from our town which contains as main textures bark, grass and pavement (Fig. 2). In Fig. 3 we have the same scene but it was taken by rotating the photo camera with an angle about 15–20°. We manually extracted three samples of textures from both of the images. The selected textures are depicted in Figs. 2 and 4. The samples represent the same three textures from both images (bark, grass, and pavement) but they are not cropped from the same spot in order to catch different illuminations of the scene. Alike visual detection of natural environments, we note that analysing the directions of important lines, shades, colours, we may detect, on different scales, different properties that help us to identify a texture. Because of its good directional selectivity, we considered the DTCWT as an appropriate tool for texture characterization. We have considered a database containing 12 grayscale texture images from the Brodatz album (Fig. 5). We uniformly preprocessed these images (the original and the rotated ones) in order to obtain a size of 64  64.

  For the DTCWT we used the following indexes for the six sub-images: j = 1 for +15º, j = 2 for +45º, j = 3 for +75º, j = 4 for −75º, j = 5 for −45º, and j = 6 for −15º. We tested different levels of wavelet decomposition (D = 1, 2, 3, 4) thus obtaining 2  6  D directional coefﬁcients.

    We computed the Sj;d ; j ¼ 1; . . .; 6; d ¼ 1; . . .; D sub-band images for the normalized texture images (with intensity values in [0, 1]). We multiplied the Sj,d by 100, rounded to the nearest integer and computed the histogram, thus obtaining six 100–dimensional feature vectors for each wavelet decomposition level. In order to compare these histograms we tested some of the distances described in [20] (ﬁve from the v2 family, ﬁve from the Shannon’s entropy family, the cosine and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient). We selected ﬁve that gave the best results. Let p and q be two histograms of size m = 100 we want to compare. We used the following distances in order to compare the histograms: dcos ðp; qÞ ¼ 1  cosðp; qÞ

  where d* is one of the ﬁve distances described above. Figure 7 depicts the histograms of the DTCWT coefﬁcients in the direction of 75° (histograms of S3) for the Sand, Water and Wood textures. As can be seen, these histograms can be used as a separation measure between images.

  For testing the features and the classiﬁers we applied two types of transformations: a geometrical one (i.e. rotations with different rotation angles) and c intensity transforms. We used the following c transformation [22]: T ðr Þ ¼ r c :

  Using DTCWT, the above presented similarity measures and minimum distance classiﬁers or SVM we seek to retrieve for each transformed image the original texture that produced it.  
   
  5 Results and Discussions For the numerical tests we employed MATLAB. To compute the DTCWT we adapted [23] the software package from Professor Nick Kingsbury’s web page [24]. As mentioned above, we tested the extracted features and the classiﬁers on 12 textures selected from the Brodatz album ([7], Fig. 5). We consider as classiﬁers the minimum distance classiﬁer (using the distances previously introduced, i.e. (3), (5), (7)–(10)) and SVM. All the texture images are of size 64  64.

  Four types of classes representing the textures were considered. The ﬁrst type has classes containing only one texture, the original one. The rotated and the c transformed ones are used separately for tests. The last three types of classes contain more than one image. The original Brodatz album contains images of size 512  512. Using these images and resizing we computed rotated and c transformed textures of the same size (512  512). For each such texture we extracted 64 (88) non-overlapping sub-images of size 64  64. Each class that represents a texture is formed by putting together these 192 (364) images. We consider three situations: in the ﬁrst two cases we treat independently the rotated and the c transformed images and in the third one the classes contain a mixture of all types of images (base, rotated, c transformed). In the rotation case the class is formed only with rotated sub-images and those extracted from the original texture. In the c transformed situation the class is formed only with original and c transformed images. We formed the training set by choosing randomly 50% of the class content (50% of each type of image: original, rotated, c transformed), the other ones were employed for classiﬁcation purpose. We have rotated the texture images with the following angles: 5°, 10°, 15° and 30°. In Fig. 8 are depicted the Rafﬁa and the Wood textures and their rotated versions.

  We applied also several c transformations to the original Brodatz. In Fig. 9. we show for Grass, Wood and Sand different c-transformed variants of these textures. In this paper, we considered values for c in [0.5, 2]. In the case of classes with only one element we used the following ﬁve distances: cosine, correlation, Topsøe, Jensen difference, and squared v2 . For the rotation angle of 5°, 10° and 15° we get 100% identiﬁcation rate for all ﬁve considered distances. For 30° rotated textures the cosine distance provides 3 errors, the correlation distance 4 errors, the other three distances have each 2 errors. The comparisons between the Rafﬁa and Wood rotated textures and the original ones using the ﬁve similarity measures described applied to the histogram of the DT sub-band images are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4. The misidentiﬁcations appear for the 30° rotation angle.

  The cosine and the correlation distances make the same mistake (Leather) and the other three distances misidentiﬁes Rafﬁa with Sand. Both mistakes are understandable from the visual point of view taking into account that we use a directional instrument. The same thing happens with the Wood texture, i.e., the cosine and the correlation distances provide Weave as classiﬁcation result and the other three classify Wood as Water. We repeated the same classiﬁcation procedure as we used for the rotated textures for the c transformed ones. We get 100% identiﬁcation rate for c 2 ½0:6; 1:7. In Table 5 are the classiﬁcation results for Grass and Sand with c ¼ 0:6 and in Table 6 are the comparisons results for Grass and Wood with c ¼ 2.

  The ﬁve distances behave in the same manner as for the rotated textures: the cosine and the correlation misidentify the same texture, and Topsøe, Jensen difference and squared v2 make the same mistake. We also studied the influence of histogram equalization of the texture images before computing the DTCWT. When we use histogram equalization, we obtain better results for the c-transformed images i.e. the interval with zero errors in the classiﬁcation process extends to c 2 ½0:05; 5:4. On the contrary when this procedure is performed on the rotated images the results are worse. In the case of histogram equalization for rotated textures classiﬁcation the results are: the cosine and correlation distances have 1 error each for the 5°, 10°, 15° rotation angles and 4 respectively 5 misidentiﬁcations for 30°.

  The Topsøe, Jensen difference and squared v2 distances have 6 errors each for the 30° rotated textures and no misidentiﬁcation for the smaller rotation angles. For the cases when the classes have more than one texture we used as classiﬁers SVM and minimum distance with cosine, Jeffreys, Topsøe, Jensen difference, and squared v2. When the rotations and c-transformations were treated separately, each class in the training set has 64 elements, 32 from the original texture and 32 from the transformed one. The test set contains a total of 768 images, 64 from each texture. The rotation angles are the same as previously (h 2 f5 ; 10 ; 15 ; 30 g) and the values for c are in f0:5; 0:6; 0:8; 0:81 ; 0:61 ; 2g. We observe from Table 7 that as h increases usually the classiﬁcation results improve, one of the poorest results is for

  h ¼ 5 , the DTCWT provides better separation of textures if the rotation angle is greater than 10°. Best results are obtained with the SVM and the Topsøe, Jensen difference distances. When applying c transformations, we considered pairs ðg; 1=gÞ; g\1. As was expected as g approaches 1 the results are getting better. Comparing the results provided by each pair ðg; 1=gÞ; g\1 one remarks that we get better results for c values greater than 1 which provide better contrast than c < 1. Again, with the SVM one gets the best results and Topsøe, Jensen difference, and squared v2 distances come next, making the same number of mistakes (Table 8). We also analysed cases when all the textures were put together: ﬁrst, the original and the rotated textures using all angles, second the original and all the c-transformed images, and the third was when all the images representing a texture were present in class content. In the ﬁrst situation, each class has 160 elements and 1920 texture were tested. In the second case the classes have each 352 elements and 4224 textures were classiﬁed. In the last case, the classes contain 480 images each and 5760 texture were employed for classiﬁcation. The results are in Table 9.

  In this case the squared v2 minimum distance classiﬁer gives in average the best results and then the SVM. If we consider all the cases with classes represented by multiple textures, we computed the average classiﬁcation rate: the best results are obtained with SVM (with a total of 399 errors), then follows the squared v2 distance (460 errors), the Topsøe, Jensen difference distances make 472 errors each, Jeffreys yields 616 misidentiﬁcations and the cosine distance makes a total of 1352 errors. For the situation of class content with mixture of all types of images we computed for each texture the total number of misidentiﬁcations, the results are summarized in Table 10. It is surprising that a texture such as Brick which has good saliency, with Table 10.

  very distinct visual and directional characteristics has one of the highest misidentiﬁcation rate and the Water texture which visually is very similar with Sand or Pigskin has no errors in classiﬁcation. We tested the cosine, correlation, Topsøe, Jensen difference and squared v2 histogram similarity measures upon the six real world textures from Figs. 2 and 4. There are three classes of textures (bark, grass, and pavement) each class having two samples. We computed for all these textures the similarity measures to the other ﬁve images. In Table 11 we marked ‘T’ (true) when the minimum distance was achieved for the image in the same class and ‘F’ (false) otherwise. The DTCWT -based similarity measures provided the correct result in all the cases (the DTCWT column in Table 11). Table 11.

  We compare the classiﬁcation obtained applying the ﬁve distances to the histogram of the DTCWT coefﬁcients to the same classiﬁcation performed when computing the similarity of the histogram of the textures (the Img column in Table 11). We obtained the correct texture when comparing the histogram of the rotated textures with the not rotated ones, in almost all cases, as expected. The cosine and the correlation distances had 1 misidentiﬁcation each for the 30° case.  
   
  6 Conclusions In this paper, we studied texture identiﬁcation in digital images with a new method. We employed the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) for texture feature extraction and identiﬁcation using various similarity measures. The DTCWT provides a set of six complex selective directional coefﬁcients, for which we employed their magnitudes {Sj,d; j = 1,…,6, d = 1,..,D}. We computed the histograms of these coefﬁcients and classiﬁed 12 textures from the Brodatz album using SVM or minimum distance classiﬁers employing six similarity measures: cosine and Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, Jeffreys, Topsøe, Jensen difference and squared v2. Our main focus was on the influence of rotation and c-transformation on the capacity of texture recognition. We analysed several cases: classes with only one texture or with multiple textures, the rotations and c-transformations were treated separately or together. We also tested the proposed method on real world images with good identiﬁcation results. Our further research will concentrate on testing the influence of the image size, the noise and also on other types of image transformations (blur, shear, etc.) beside rotations and

 SOFSEM Profile   
  SOFSEM maintains a unique position among the annual conferences and symposia in computing. Through its invited talks and the selected contributed papers on current research, as well as its well-known familiar atmosphere, SOFSEM is an appreciable mix of an international symposium and a winter school. It is a proven format, combining the presentation of original, high-quality research papers with lectures on trending themes in foundations and their, often interdisciplinary, background. SOFSEM conferences are conducted in person. Traditionally housing all participants at the same  venue, the conference provides an optimal set-up for discussions, meetings, research initiatives, new contacts, and social interactions. SOFSEM encourages the co-operation and exchange of ideas among researchers across all domains of fundamental computer science and its bordering fields, in all stages of their career. It makes SOFSEM especially attractive for young computer scientists.  
 SOFSEM focuses on novel research and current developments in all key areas in fundamental computer science and its interfaces to the foundations of artificial intelligence ( algorithms, AI-inspired methods, computational complexity, formal models  ). SOFSEM's list of topics of interest was renewed in 2022 and evolves with the developments and trends in foundational research in computing with each edition of the conference.   
 Awards   
 Each year the SOFSEM Program Committee determines which of the contributed papers is/are deservant of the Best Student Paper Award  and the Best Paper Award  of the conference.   Best Paper and Best Student Paper Awards 2024: see | SOFSEM 2024 | .

  SOFSEM conferences can be organized in any European country. The location of SOFSEM x+2  is normally decided at the business meeting of SOFSEM x+1  , in January or February of year x  +1. Proposals for organizing SOFSEM x+2  are welcomed any time during year x  , well ahead of this business meeting. If you/your team is interested in organizing the next SOFSEM, please get in touch with the Steering Committee.  Guidelines for proposing to organize a SOFSEM conference: | pdf | . 
  There are separate guidelines for PC chairs and organizers of a SOFSEM conference ( pdf  , or contact the steering committee). The organizers of the SOFSEM in a given year decide whether they wish to allow for e.g. exhibitions of literature (books, journals), meetings or presentations of national or international research projects, or other special activities. Interested parties should contact the organizing committee for further details. Code of Conduct  
 SOFSEM is committed to providing a safe and welcoming conference environment, where ideas can be expressed and exchanged openly and freely, where the rights and dignity of every person and group are respected, and where principles of diversity and inclusion are embraced throughout.

  SOFSEM ( orig.  SOFtware SEMinar) was founded in 1974 as a winter seminar for computer scientists and software engineers in former Czechoslovakia. SOFSEM soon became the foremost national seminar devoted to theoretical and practical problems of software systems. In fact, in these early days of computer science and technology, SOFSEM supplemented the university education and academic research by facilitating a fast transfer of the latest relevant knowledge in computing to its audience. Later on international experts were invited also, to present series of lectures on recent topics. Each SOFSEM consisted of several series of invited lectures of 3 to 5 hours, complemented by selected contributions of participants. Until 1994, the total duration of every SOFSEM was two weeks. Gradually, SOFSEM transformed from a mainly national seminar into an international conference. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 SOFSEM continued, but now alternating between the Czech and Slovak Republics. SOFSEM became recognized for its high-level invited talks and well-chosen tracks that followed the trends in the field. From 1995 onward, the SOFSEM proceedings were included in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science of Springer. The duration of SOFSEM was shortened to eight days, and the track areas became more and more fixed for a longer time. Over the years, as the field expanded and international collaborations flourished, SOFSEM's unique role within the Czech and Slovak computer science communities lessened, yet its significance and position as an international symposium grew.  
 In 2016 the SOFSEM Steering Committee decided that, from then on, SOFSEM conferences could be organized by colleagues anywhere in Europe, i.e. not limited to the Czech or Slovak Republics anymore. The duration of SOFSEM was limited to a week or four days but its format and focus were still left unchanged, with three separate tracks (foundations, software engineering, and data science and engineering), a special theme track (algorithmic computational biology), and a student research forum. In 2022 SOFSEM did not take place, due to the covid-19 pandemic, but the time was used to prepare SOFSEM for the next major step on its new course, namely focusing the conference fully and undividedly to the foundations of computer science, together with its interfaces to closely related areas, especially the computational principles of artificial intelligence and data science.

 SOFSEM 2025 Call for papers  
  July 23rd, 2024  Daniela Lopez de Luise   
 *************************   
 **** SOFSEM 2025 ****   

 50th International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science   
   
 January 20 – 23, 2025, Bratislava, Slovakia   
   
 http://www.sofsem.sk    

 Call for Papers   
   
 SOFSEM is an annual winter conference devoted to the theory and practice of   
 computer science. The conference traditionally focuses on the latest results   
 and developments of fundamental research in computer science (informatics),   
 inspired by the algorithmic challenges of our time. SOFSEM has a long tradition   
 as a high-quality research conference, and a venue where researchers from   
 academia and industry in all stages of their career can share their insights.   
 The series of SOFSEM conferences began in 1974, and was only interrupted in   
 2022 due to the covid pandemic. In 2025, at its 50th edition, SOFSEM will be   
 held as a physical event in Bratislava, Slovakia. The proceedings will be   
 published in the subseries ARCoSS (Advanced Research in Computing and Software   
 Science) of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) of Springer.   
   
 Topics   
   
 The program committee encourages submission of original research papers in all   
 areas of foundations of computer science and artificial intelligence, including   
 e.g.   
   
 * AI-based algorithms and techniques,   
 * algorithms (approximation, combinatorial, exact, online, parameterized, probabilistic,   
 streaming, etc)   
 * automata (cellular, finite, networked, etc), languages, machine models, rewriting systems   
 * computability, decidability, classical and non-classical models of computation,   
 * computational complexity (incuding e.g. communication, descriptional, fine-grained,   
 Kolmogorov, non-uniform, fixed-parameter and structural complexity),   
 * computational geometry,   
 * computational learning,   
 * cryptographic techniques and security,   
 * data compression algorithms,   
 * data- and pattern mining methods (includeing e.g. models, theory, algorithms)   
 * discrete combinatorial optimization, heuristics, local search, SAT solvers, simulation   
 * efficient data structures (including e.g. dynamic, geometric, and spatial datastructures)   
 * experimental algorithmics, applications   
 * formal models of systems (including e.g. concurrent, hybrid, reactive, mobile, net-based,   
 and timed systems)   
 * graph structure and algorithms,   
 * intelligent algorithms,   
 * logics of computation, process models, program synthesis   
 * machine learning theory,   
 * multi-agent algorithms and games,   
 * nature-inspired computing,   
 * network science,   
 * neural network theory,   
 * parallel and distributed computing,   
 * quantum computing,   
 * robotics   
 * structural complexity,

 CFP: Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics – Your Submission Is Welcome!  
  October 19th, 2020  Daniela Lopez de Luise   

 The 12 th  International Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics: IMCIC 2021  , will be held on March 9 – 12, 2021  , in Orlando, Florida, USA.  
 You can submit an article at  : http://www.iiis-2021conf.org/imcic   
 This conference has always contemplated the two modalities of participation: face to face and virtual  . However, given the current Coronavirus situation and travel restrictions, at this moment we are only accepting submissions for virtual participation. If the situation changes and we feel the safety of our participants would not be at risk, we will start accepting submissions for face-to-face participation, and those authors who submitted their article for virtual participation will have the ability to change their participation modality to face-to-face, if they wish.  
 The Proceedings of IMCIC and ICSIT/ICETI have been indexed by Elsevier's SCOPUS  since 2010. The 2021 proceedings will also be sent to Elsevier's SCOPUS.  
 The conference will also be jointly held with:  
 The 12 | th | International Conference on Education, Training and Informatics: ICETI 2021 
  The 12 | th | International Conference on Society and Information Technologies: ICSIT 2021 
  More details regarding these and other collocated events and special tracks can be found at: http://www.iiis-2021conf.org/cfp-spring2021.asp   
 The deadlines  for this CFP are as follows:  
 October 27 th  , 2020 | : Article submissions 
  October 27 th  , 2020 | : Invited/Special session proposals 
  November 25 th  , 2020 | : Notifications of acceptance 
  December 15 th  , 2020 | : Uploading of camera-ready or final version 
  Both synchronous and asynchronous virtual presentations are possible  . Therefore, the authors who participate virtually in the conference have the option of:  
 Submitting a slide show and/or a pre-recorded video of their presentation (asynchronous presentation) or 
  Making their presentation via Zoom (synchronous presentation) 
  Additionally, each paper to be presented at the event, virtually or in-person, may be read and commented on, via electronic forums, and evaluated by those participants who have registered for the conference.  
 You also have the option to contribute as a member of the Organizing Committee by accepting our invitation for organizing an invited or special session  , where you would have the responsibility of promoting your session and reviewing the articles submitted to you. You should appoint your own reviewers to support you. Effective organizers will be included as co-editors of the volume of the proceedings in which the papers of the session(s) that they organized have been included. If you accept this invitation, please submit your proposal through the conference web site.  
 Keynote speakers will be selected from registered authors whose submissions are among the best according to their external reviewers. The identification of the best submissions will be based on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the reviewers and the percentage of reviewers recommending the acceptance of the submission as related to all the reviewers who made their respective reviews. For this reason, we recommend you to submit your paper early  .  
 Registered authors of accepted submissions will be invited to make an additional presentation with no additional charge  , if such a presentation is oriented to inter-disciplinary communication. These authors will also have the option of writing an invited paper associated with their respective invited presentation.  
 Furthermore, the best papers presented at the conference, as selected by the audiences of each respective session, will also be published in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics (JCSI). JSCI is indexed in EBSCO, Cabell, DOAJ, and Google Scholar and is listed in Cabell Directory of Publishing Opportunities and in Ulrich's Periodical Directory.  
 For the past 25 years, professors, students, and researchers from all over the world have come together at our conferences to present research and engage in interdisciplinary discussion. It is this interdisciplinary focus that allows our attendees to discover new viewpoints they otherwise would not have discovered in a uni-disciplinary conference. These new viewpoints become intellectual seeds which, as they slowly bloom over time, expand their understanding of their own respective disciplines.  
 Many of our participants look forward to our conferences every year as they allow them to publish their papers, share their life's work, create a network of influential and like-minded colleagues, and expand their ever-growing understanding of their respective disciplines, as well as learn about new disciplines. Some testimonials can be read clicking on the button “  TESTIMONIALS” placed at the top of the left column of each of the conference web sites.  
 We hope to continue creating and expanding inter-disciplinary networks while facilitating the ever-growing expansion of each individual discipline represented at our conferences. We know this is only possible with contributions from people such as yourself. It is for this reason that we would greatly appreciate your contribution to the conference.  
 You are also welcome to forward this message to any appropriate colleagues and/or groups whose contributions would further promote the interdisciplinary growth of all the various disciplines represented in our conferences.  
 Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your contribution.  
 Respectfully,  
 IMCIC 2021 Organizing Committee

 Welcome Message   
 Dear participants and colleagues, it is our pleasure to welcome you to the SoftCOM 2024 conference. We are excited to have an opportunity to take part in the organization of an international conference that gathers researchers and professionals from academia and industry to share experiences and new ideas in such a dynamic area as Information and Communication Technology. Current and emerging information and communication technologies are key drivers of the digital society and economy. With both evolving and new services we are enabling people to collaborate, innovate, learn, participate in ways we never thought possible. Through joint research and technology advancement we are opening ground for new discoveries and sustainable global economic growth. We can shape the future in ways that are clean, green, healthy, safe, and more resilient, and we have an opportunity for a systemic shift to a more sustainable economy that works for both people and the planet. The conference will provide opportunities to interact and network with presenters, experts, peers, and colleagues, as well as to participate in various discussions. The 32nd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2024), technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, will be held on September 26-28, 2024 in Split-Bol (island of Brac). It will be our pleasure to meet you at the conference. Welcome!  

 IMPORTANT NOTE   
 The preliminary program is available at the link!

 Paper Submission Deadline: Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST.  
   
 Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers: March 31, 2025.  
   
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025)  , sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory ( SIGACT  ), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23  to Friday, June 27  .  
 Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.  
 Submission format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below)  , and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
   
  Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
   
  STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…").  
   
  The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
   
  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
   
  PC Member Submissions:  Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.  
   
  Recommended Best Practices for References:  Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages.  
   
  Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.  
 Conflict of Interest Policy:  The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here  ) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy  . Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate  affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  
 Submission Instructions:  Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  
 The submission server  is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.   
 It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:  The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.  
 Presentation of Accepted Papers:  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
  
 Dates and other relevant information:  
 Paper submission deadline:  Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.  
   
  Notification date:  by email on or before February 1, 2025.  
   
  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:  A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format  , and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers.  
   
  STOC talks:  Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.  
   
 Publication date:  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best Paper Award:  The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html  .  
 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:  A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html  .  
 Access to Proceedings:  The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025.  
 Student Travel Awards:  SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Call for Papers 
  Accepted papers: First and Second Cycle 
  Call for Papers  
  
 The International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) is the premier forum for presenting and discussing the most recent and significant technical research contributions in the field of Software Engineering. In the research track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results of software engineering research.  
 ICSE 2025 will follow a dual deadline structure introduced in 2024. In other words, submissions will occur in two cycles. Please refer to the section on Dual Submission Cycles in the following for the information.  
 NEW THIS YEAR #1  : Due to the rapid growth of the area of “AI and Software Engineering”, it is now split into two: “AI for Software Engineering” and “Software Engineering for AI”. A new area “Architecture and Design” is introduced. The topics listed under each area have also been revised. Please see the “Research Areas” section below.  
 NEW THIS YEAR #2  : We add back opportunities for “Author Response” in addition to “Revision” so that some potential misunderstandings can be clarified in the review process for papers that otherwise would be rejected. Also, for a paper receiving a “Revision” outcome, authors will be given an additional page of text in the revised paper to accommodate the required changes specified in the reviews.  
 NEW THIS YEAR #3  : Submissions must follow the latest “ IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policy  ” and “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” (with associated FAQ  , which includes a policy regarding the use of generative AI tools and technologies  , such as ChatGPT. After checking with the ICSE Steering Committee, we are piloting a human-in-the-loop automated process to identify AI-generated papers. A Review Process Co-Chair has volunteered to design and run this pilot process on submitted papers. To preserve confidentiality, when scanning submitted papers, the scripts will not make use of any third-party services.  
 NEW THIS YEAR #4  : IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology and ICSE 2025, have received approval from the ICSE Steering Committee to launch the Sustainable Community Review Effort (SCRE) program, aimed at reducing community effort in reviewing journal extensions of conference papers and allowing authors to get faster and more consistent feedback. More information is available at: http://tinyurl.com/icse25-scre   
 NEW THIS YEAR #5  : ICSE Steering Committee has recently approved a proposal for streamlining and enhancing the paper bidding and assignment process, aimed at reducing the workload of PC members and resulting in better assignments of papers. Two Review Process Co-Chairs have volunteered to help manage the updated bidding and assignment process. More information is available at: http://tinyurl.com/icse25-streamlining   
 NEW THIS YEAR #6  : ICSE Steering Committee has recently approved a proposal for Shadow PC. Shadow PC is a mentoring program to train early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) in the review process of the technical track. For Cycle 2, for the first time, authors of ICSE submissions can opt-in for their papers to be considered for review in the Shadow PC track. Shadow reviews for papers that are reviewed by the Shadow PC will be sent out to authors after the end of the actual review process; shadow reviews will not affect the official decision made by the regular PC. More detailed information about the program is available at: http://tinyurl.com/icse25-shadowpc   
  Research Areas   
 ICSE welcomes submissions addressing topics across the full spectrum of Software Engineering, being inclusive of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research. Topics of interest include the following and are grouped into the following nine research areas. Please note that these topics are by no means exhaustive.  
 Each submission will need to indicate one of these nine areas as the chosen area. Optionally, the authors can consider adding an additional area. A paper may be moved from the chosen area(s) to another focus area at the discretion of the program chairs. Program chairs will ultimately assign a paper to an area chair, considering the authors’ selection, the paper’s content, and other factors such as (if applicable) possible conflicts of interest.

   Scope   
 Since the authors will choose an area for their submission, the scope of each area becomes important. Some submissions may relate to multiple areas. In such cases, the authors should choose the area for which their paper brings the maximum new insights. Moreover, authors also have the choice of indicating an alternate area for each paper.  
 Similarly, for certain papers. authors may have a question whether it belongs to any area, or is simply out of scope. For such cases, we recommend the authors to judge whether their paper brings new insights for software engineering. As an example, a formal methods paper with a focus on hardware verification may be deemed out of scope for ICSE. In general, papers that only peripherally concern software engineering and do not give new insights from the software engineering perspective would be less relevant to ICSE. Our goal is, however, to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive, to enable authors to make their own decisions about relevance.  
  Dual Submission Cycles   
 Similar to ICSE 2024, we will have two submission cycles as follows:  
 First submission cycle

  All dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h).  
  Review Criteria   
 Each paper submitted to the Research Track will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 i) Novelty  : The novelty and innovativeness of contributed solutions, problem formulations, methodologies, theories, and/or evaluations, i.e., the extent to which the paper is sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art.  
 ii) Rigor  : The soundness, clarity, and depth of a technical or theoretical contribution, and the level of thoroughness and completeness of an evaluation.  
 iii) Relevance  : The significance and/or potential impact of the research on the field of software engineering.  
 iv) Verifiability and Transparency  : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works; to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. Any artifacts attached to or linked from the paper will be checked by one reviewer.  
 v) Presentation  : The clarity of the exposition in the paper.  
 Reviewers will carefully consider all of the above criteria during the review process, and authors should take great care in clearly addressing them all. The paper should clearly explain and justify the claimed contributions. Each paper will be handled by an area chair who will ensure reviewing consistency among papers submitted within that area.  
 The outcome of each paper will be one of the following Accept, Revision, Reject. We now elaborate on the Revision outcome in the following.  
  Revisions   
 Papers submitted can go through revisions in response to specific revision requests made by the reviewers. Authors of papers receiving a Revision decision are expected to submit the revised papers, as well as the revised papers with changes marked in a different color, such as using LaTeXdiff. The authors also need to submit an “Author Response” document capturing the authors’ response to each reviewer’s comment and how those comments were addressed in the revision. This is similar to the “Summary of Changes and Response” document that is typically submitted by authors for a journal paper’s major revision. Authors may use the revision opportunity to revise and improve the paper, but should not use this to submit a substantially different paper. The reviewers will check the revised paper against the original paper and the suggested changes. Revised papers will be examined by the same set of reviewers. An unsatisfactory revised paper will be rejected. Authors are given 4 weeks  to submit the revised papers. This is 1 week less than prior year as we reallocate the time to (i) add authors’ rebuttal, and (ii) provide more time for PC members to complete their reviews (to reduce reviewing fatigue considering the high workload to review increasing number of submissions). Authors are given an additional page of text in a revised paper to accommodate the required changes specified in the reviews.  
  Re-submissions of Rejected Papers   
 Authors of papers which receive a REJECT decision in the first submission cycle are strongly discouraged from re-submitting it to the second submission cycle. However, in exceptional cases where the reviewers evidently misunderstood their paper, upon approval of PC Chairs, authors can re-submit their paper to the second submission cycle with a “Clarifications and Summary of Improvements” document stating how they have changed the paper. They should also include the past reviews as part of this document, for completeness. These papers will be treated as new submissions, which may or may not get the same set of reviewers at the discretion of the PC chairs. Authors who try to bypass this guideline (e.g., by changing the paper title without significantly changing paper content, or by making small changes to the paper content) will have their papers desk-rejected by the PC chairs without further consideration.

  Open Science Policy   
 The research track of ICSE 2025 is governed by the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. The guiding principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public and, if possible, empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open artifacts and open source principles. We encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data/artifacts to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, sharing is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified. We recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see this curated Q&A page  .  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked  
 to make their artifact available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) – and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  to include in the submission an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  to indicate in the submission why they do not intend to make their data or study materials publicly available upon acceptance, if that is the case. The default understanding is that the data and/or other artifacts will be publicly available upon acceptance of a paper. 
   Withdrawing a Paper   
 Authors can withdraw their paper at any moment until the final decision has been made, through the paper submission system. Resubmitting the paper to another venue before the final decision has been made without withdrawing from ICSE 2025 first is considered a violation of the concurrent submission policy, and will lead to automatic rejection from ICSE 2025 as well as any other venue adhering to this policy. Such violations may also be reported to appropriate organizations e.g. ACM and IEEE.  
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ICSE 2025 and present the paper. We are assuming that the conference will be in-person, and if it is virtual or hybrid, virtual presentations may be possible. These matters will be discussed with the authors closer to the date of the conference.

 Abstract:  Database management systems (DBMSs) consistently strive for enhanced performance. For a given query, the optimizer of a DBMS aims to construct an optimal execution plan that incorporates multiple optimization operations. However, the resulting plan may sometimes perform worse than even if no optimizations were applied. This occurs because the interactions between optimizations are complex and some situations might be overlooked in the implementation. We refer to these issues as Performance Degradation Bugs (PDBs). PDBs can result in significant consequences from decreased system efficiency and prolonged query processing times to potential disruptions in critical business operations. In this paper, we present Puppy, an automated approach for detecting PDBs in DBMSs using limited-optimization plan construction. The key idea is to compare the performance with the plan generated with all optimization operations enabled, against the plan generated with only a subset of optimization operations in the same DBMS. If the response time of the plan with the limited optimization set is shorter than that of the fully optimized plan, it indicates a potential PDB. Specifically, Puppy first generates queries that incorporate multiple optimization sequences, guided by optimization operation sequence coverage. Secondly, Puppy analyzes the query plan and selectively disables specific optimizations to construct the limited optimization plan. We evaluate Puppy on five widely-used DBMSs, namely MySQL, Percona, TiDB, PolarDB, and PostgreSQL against the state-of-the-art DBMS performance testing tools APOLLO and AMOEBA. Puppy detected 26 and 25 more performance anomalies, covered 151,201 and 173,798 more branches than APOLLO and AMOEBA in 48 hours, respectively. More importantly, Puppy reports 62 PDBs, with 54 anomalies confirmed as previously unknown bugs.

 Abstract:  Engineers utilize logs as a primary resource for fault localization in large-scale software and system testing, a process that is notoriously time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. Despite considerable progress in automated fault localization approaches, their applicability remains limited in such settings, due to the unavailability of fine-grained features in logs essential for most existing fault localization methods. In response, we introduce FALCON, a novel log-based fault localization framework. FALCON organizes complex semantic log information into graphical representations and employs contrastive learning to capture the differences between passed and failed logs, enabling the identification of crucial fault-related features. It also incorporates a specifically designed transitive analysis-based adaptive graph augmentation to minimize the influence of fault-unrelated log information on contrastive learning. Through extensive evaluations against 34 spectrum-based and 4 learning-based fault localization methods, FALCON demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison. In addition, FALCON demonstrated its practical value by successfully identifying 71 out of 90 faults with a file-level Top-1 accuracy rate during a one-month deployment within a global company’s testing system.

 Abstract:  Database connectors are widely used in many applications to facilitate flexible and convenient database interactions. Potential vulnerabilities in database connectors can lead to various abnormal behaviors within applications, such as returning incorrect results or experiencing unexpected connection interruption. However, existing fuzzing works cannot be directly applied to testing database connectors as they mainly focus on SQL generation and use a small subset of database connector interfaces to execute SQLs. Due to a lack of domain knowledge, automated test case generation also struggles to generate complex test cases that explore connectors' deep logic. The main challenge in testing database connectors is to generate semantically correct test cases that can trigger a wide range of connector state transitions. To address that, we propose CONI, a framework designed for detecting logic bugs of database connectors with state-aware test case generation. First, we define the database connector state model by analyzing the corresponding specification. Building upon this model, CONI generates interface call sequences within test cases to encompass more connector state transitions. After that, CONI generates suitable parameter values based on the parameter information and contextual information collected during runtime. Then the test cases are executed on a target and a reference database connector. Inconsistent results indicate potential logic bugs. We evaluate CONI on 5 widely-used JDBC database connectors, namely MySQL Connector/J, MariaDB Connector/J, AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL, PGJDBC NG, and PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. In total, CONI successfully detected 44 previously unknown bugs, of which 34 have been confirmed.

 Abstract:  Code search is a vital activity in software engineering, focused on identifying and retrieving the correct code snippets based on a query provided in natural language. Approaches based on deep learning techniques have been increasingly adopted for this task, enhancing the initial representations of both code and its natural language descriptions. Despite this progress, there remains an unexplored gap in ensuring consistency between the representation spaces of code and its descriptions. Furthermore, existing methods have not fully leveraged the potential relevance between code snippets and their descriptions, presenting a challenge in discerning fine-grained semantic distinctions among similar code snippets. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-task hedging contrastive Learning framework for Code Search, referred to as HedgeCode. HedgeCode is structured around two primary training phases. The first phase, known as the representation alignment stage, proposes a hedging contrastive learning approach. This method aims to detect subtle differences between code and natural language text, thereby aligning their representation spaces by identifying relevance. The subsequent phase involves multi-task joint learning, wherein the previously trained model serves as the encoder. This stage optimizes the model through a combination of supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning tasks. Our framework’s effectiveness is demonstrated through its performance on the CodeSearchNet benchmark, showcasing HedgeCode’s ability to address the mentioned limitations in code search tasks.

 Abstract:  To enhance smart contracts with cryptographic capabilities, Ethereum has officially provided a set of system-level cryptographic APIs, such as ecrecover. These APIs have been utilized in over 10% of Ethereum transactions, motivating developers to implement various on-chain cryptographic tasks, such as digital signatures. However, since developers may not always be cryptographic experts, their ad-hoc and potentially defective implementations could compromise the theoretical guarantees of cryptography, leading to real-world security issues. To mitigate this threat, we conducted the first study aimed at demystifying and detecting cryptographic defects in smart contracts. Through the analysis of 2,406 real-world security reports, we defined nine types of cryptographic defects in smart contracts with detailed descriptions and practical detection patterns. Based on this categorization, we proposed CrySol, a fuzzing-based tool to automate the detection of cryptographic defects in smart contracts. It combines transaction replaying and dynamic taint analysis to extract fine-grained crypto-related semantics and employs crypto-specific strategies to guide the test case generation process. urthermore, we collected a large-scale dataset containing 25,745 real-world crypto-related smart contracts and evaluated CrySol's effectiveness on it. The result demonstrated that CrySol achieves an overall precision of 95.4% and a recall of 91.2%. Notably, CrySol revealed that 5,847 (22.7%) out of 25,745 contracts contain at least one cryptographic defect, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.

 Abstract:  Rendering lies at the heart of our modern web experience. However, the correctness of browser rendering is not always guaranteed, often leading to rendering bugs. Traditional differential testing, while successful in various domains, falls short when applied to rendering bug detection because an HTML file is likely yield different rendered outcomes across different browsers. This paper introduces Visual Delta Consistency, a test oracle to detect rendering bugs in web browsers, aiming to make rendered pages across browsers comparable. Our key insight is that any modifications made to an HTML file should uniformly influence rendering outcomes across browsers. Specifically, when presented with two HTML files that differ only by minor modifications, the reaction of all browsers should be consistent, i.e., either all browsers render them identically or all render them differently. Based on this insight, We implemented it as a practical fuzzer named Janus. It constructs pairs of slightly modified HTML files and observes the change statuses of the corresponding rendered pages across browsers for bug detection. We evaluated it on three widely-used browsers, i.e., Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. In total, Janus detected 34 rendering bugs, out of which 26 confirmed with 8 fixed by the developers.

 Abstract:  The leakage of secret information via a public channel is a critical privacy flaw in software systems. The more information is leaked per observation, the less time an attacker needs to learn the secret. Due to the size and complexity of the modern software, and because some empirical facts are not available to a formal analysis of the source code, researchers started investigating statistical methods using program executions as samples. However, current statistical methods require a high sample coverage. Ideally, the sample is large enough to contain every possible combination of secret $\times$ observable value to accurately reflect the joint distribution of $\langle$secret, observable$\rangle$. Otherwise, the information leakage is severely underestimated, which is problematic as it can lead to overconfidence in the security of an otherwise vulnerable program. In this paper, we introduce an improved estimator for information leakage and propose to use methods from applied statistics to improve our estimate of the joint distribution when sample coverage is low. The key idea is to reconstruct the joint distribution by casting our problem as a multinomial estimation problem in the absence of samples for all classes. We suggest two approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of each approach on a set of benchmark subjects. We also propose novel refinement heuristics, which help to adjust the joint distribution and gain better estimation accuracy. Compared to existing statistical methods for information leakage estimation, our method can safely overestimate the mutual information and provide a more accurate estimate from a limited number of program executions.

 Abstract:  Machine learning models are widely used but can also often be wrong. Users would benefit from a reliable indication of whether a given output from a given model should be trusted, so a rational decision can be made whether to use the output or not. For example, outputs can be associated with a \emph{confidence measure}; if this confidence measure is strongly associated with \emph{likelihood of correctness}, then the model is said to be \emph{well-calibrated}. In this case, the confidence measure can serve as a basis for rational graduated decision making on how much review and care is needed. \emph{Calibration} has so far been studied in mostly non-generative (\emph{e.g.}, classification) settings, especially in Software Engineering. However, generated code can quite often be wrong: Given generated code developers must decide whether to directly use, use after varying intensity of careful review, or discard model-generated code; thus calibration is vital in generative settings. In this paper we make several contributions. We develop a framework for evaluating the calibration of code-generating models. We consider several tasks, correctness criteria, datasets, and approaches, and find that by and large generative code models are \textbf{\textit{\underline{not}}} well-calibrated out of the box. We then show how calibration can be improved, using standard methods such as Platt scaling. Since Platt scaling relies on the prior availability of correctness data, we evaluate the applicability and generalizability of Platt scaling in Software Engineering, discuss settings where it has good potential for practical use, and settings where it does not. Our contributions will lead to better-calibrated decision-making in the current use of code generated by language models, and offers a framework for future research to further improve calibration methods for generative models in Software Engineering.

 Abstract:  The Rust programming language, with its safety guarantees, has established itself as a viable choice for low-level systems programming language over the traditional, unsafe alternatives like C/C++. These guarantees come from a strong ownership-based type system, as well as primitive support for features like closures, pattern matching, etc., that make the code more concise and amenable to reasoning. These unique Rust features also pose a steep learning curve for programmers. This paper presents a tool called RustAssistant that leverages the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest fixes for Rust compilation errors. RustAssistant uses a careful combination of prompting techniques as well as iteration between an LLM and the Rust compiler to deliver high accuracy of fixes. RustAssistant is able to achieve an impressive peak accuracy of roughly 74% on real-world compilation errors in popular open-source Rust repositories. We also contribute a dataset of Rust compilation errors to enable further research.

 Abstract:  Comments are widely used in source code. If a comment is consistent with the code snippet it intends to annotate, it would aid code comprehension. Otherwise, Code Comment Inconsistency (CCI) is not only detrimental to the understanding of code, but more importantly, it would negatively impact the development, testing, and maintenance of software. To tackle this issue, existing research has been primarily focused on detecting inconsistencies with varied performance. It is evident that detection alone does not solve the problem; it merely paves the way for solving it. A complete solution requires detecting inconsistencies and, more importantly, rectifying them by amending comments. However, this type of work is scarce. In this paper, we contribute C4RLLaMA, a fine-tuned large language model based on the open-source CodeLLaMA. It not only has the ability to rectify inconsistencies by correcting relevant comment content but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in detecting inconsistencies. Experiments with various datasets confirm that C4RLLaMA consistently surpasses both Post Hoc and Just-in-time CCI detection approaches. More importantly, C4RLLaMA outperforms substantially the only known CCI rectification approach in terms of multiple performance metrics. To further examine C4RLLaMA's efficacy in rectifying inconsistencies, we conducted a manual evaluation, and the results showed that the percentage of correct comment updates by C4RLLaMA was 65.0\% and 55.9\% in Just-in-time and Post Hoc, respectively, implying C4RLLaMA's real potential in practical use.  
  
  Kai Huang, Jian Zhang, Xiangxin Meng, Yang Liu, "Template-Guided Program Repair in the Era of Large Language Models"  
 Abstract:  Recent advancements in automated program repair (APR) have been significantly driven by the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, the integration of LLMs with traditional template-based repair methods has demonstrated effective outcomes. Despite this, the synergy between the strengths of traditional methods and LLMs remains underexploited. This oversight originates from the indiscriminate use of templates and their insufficient coverage. Also, using small-scale LLMs within the zero-shot learning context proves to be suboptimal. To alleviate the limitations, we propose NTR (Neural Template Repair), a two-stage repair framework including template selection and patch generation, both of which are under the fine-tuning paradigm. In the template selection phase, we formulate it as a multiclass classification problem and fine-tune million-level LLMs for better selecting possible templates. During the patch generation phase, we leverage the chosen templates as probable directions (e.g., `Mutate Conditional Expression') to guide the fine-tuning process of LLMs at the billion-level scale for precise patch creation. Moreover, we incorporate a unique template to signify the absence of a suitable template and employ a probability-based prioritization of templates, thereby optimizing patch generation. This framework not only effectively addresses template mismatch issues, but also enables the billion-level LLMs to explore the patch space more efficiently, despite the GPU memory constraints. We evaluate NTR with different foundational models on Defects4J V1.2 and HumanEval-Java, the framework consistently demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing StarCoder as the foundational model for patch generation, NTR fixes 128 and 129 bugs in Defects4J and HumanEval, outperforming the best baseline APR tool by 14 and 59 bugs. With the larger CodeLlama model, the fixed bugs rise to 139 and 136, respectively, exceeding the baseline by 25 and 66 bugs. Notably, the performance stems not only from the foundational models but also benefits greatly from our NTR framework. Specifically, NTR's implementation with StarCoder and CodeLlama leads to 22 and 23 additional fixes, which is beyond what the models achieve on their own. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on utilizing templates to unlock the bug-fixing potential of LLMs.

 Abstract:  Testing for accessibility is a significant step when developing software, as it ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively engage with web and mobile applications. While automated tools exist to detect accessibility issues in software, none are as comprehensive and effective as the process of user testing, where testers with various disabilities evaluate the application for accessibility and usability issues. However, user testing is not popular with software developers as it requires conducting lengthy interviews with users and later parsing through large recordings to derive the issues to fix. In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) like GPT 4.0, which have shown promising results in context comprehension and semantic text generation, can mitigate this issue and streamline the user testing process. Our solution, called Reca11, takes in informal transcripts of test recordings and extracts the accessibility and usability issues mentioned by the tester. Our systematic prompt engineering determines the optimal configuration of input, instruction, context and demonstrations for best results. We evaluate Reca11's effectiveness on 36 user testing sessions across three applications. Based on the findings, we investigate the strengths and weaknesses of using LLMs in this space.

 Abstract:  Misconfigurations are major causes of software failures. Existing practices rely on developer-written rules or test cases to validate configurations, which are expensive. Machine learning (ML) for configuration validation is considered a promising direction, but has been facing challenges such as the need of large-scale field data and system-specific models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing some of the long-lasting limitations of ML-based configuration validation. We present a first analysis on the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for configuration validation. We empirically evaluate LLMs as configuration validators by developing a generic LLM-based configuration validation framework, named Ciri. Ciri employs effective prompt engineering with few-shot learning based on both valid configuration and misconfiguration data. Ciri checks outputs from LLMs when producing results, addressing hallucination and nondeterminism of LLMs. We evaluate Ciri’s validation effectiveness on eight popular LLMs using configuration data of ten widely deployed open-source systems. Our analysis (1) confirms the potential of using LLMs for configuration validation, (2) explores design space of LLMbased validators like Ciri, and (3) reveals open challenges such as ineffectiveness in detecting certain types of misconfigurations and biases towards popular configuration parameters.

 Abstract:  This paper presents BSan, a practical software-only memory error detector for binary code. Different from state-of-the-art binary-level detectors, which rely on either the shadow memory-based approach or the hardware-specific feature and thus suffer from several fundamental limitations, BSan adopts an identifier-based approach, enabling it to detect deep memory errors missed by existing detectors. Also, BSan does not depend on any specific hardware features. To reduce the high performance overhead caused by identifier propagation, BSan creates a novel hybrid approach, static analysis+dynamic instrumentation, to improve the performance without inheriting the poor reliability of static binary rewriting, distinguishing it from existing detectors that simply refer to static binary rewriting for better performance. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that BSan can detect more memory errors than state-of-the-art binary-level detectors. Meanwhile, the performance and memory overheads of BSan are comparable to those of existing detectors.

 Abstract:  Differential testing is a prevalent strategy for establishing test oracles in automated DBMS testing. However, meticulously selecting equivalent DBMSs with diverse implementations and compatible input syntax requires huge manual efforts. In this paper, we propose Thanos, a framework that finds DBMS bugs via storage engine rotation based differential testing. Our key insight is that a DBMS with different storage engines must provide consistent basic storage functionalities. Therefore, it’s feasible to construct equivalent DBMSs based on storage engine rotation, ensuring that the same SQL test cases to these equivalent DBMSs yield consistent results. The framework involves four main steps: 1) select the appropriate storage engines; 2) extract equivalence information among the selected storage engines; 3) synthesize feature-orient test cases that ensure the DBMS equivalence; and 4) send test cases to the DBMSs with selected storage engines and compare the results. We evaluate Thanos on three widely used and extensively tested DBMSs, namely MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona against state-of-the-art fuzzers SQLancer, SQLsmith, and Squirrel. Thanos outperforms them on branch coverage by 24%–116%, and also finds many bugs missed by other fuzzers. More importantly, the vendors have confirmed 32 previously unknown bugs found by Thanos, with 29 verified as Critical.

 Abstract:  Many developers relying on open-source digital infrastructure expect continuous maintenance, but even the most critical packages can become unmaintained. Despite this, there is little understanding of the prevalence of abandonment of widely-used packages, of subsequent exposure, and of reactions to abandonment in practice, or the factors that influence them. We perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of all widely-used npm packages and find that abandonment is common among them, that abandonment exposes many projects which often do not respond, that responses correlate with other dependency management practices, and that removal is significantly faster when a projects end-of-life status is explicitly stated. We end with recommendations to both researchers and practitioners who are facing dependency abandonment or are sunsetting projects, such as opportunities for low-effort transparency mechanisms to help exposed projects make better, more informed decisions.

 Abstract:  In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accuracy, and high duplication rates, leading to unreliable model performance in realistic vulnerability detection scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation methods used with these datasets are not representative of real-world vulnerability detection. To address these challenges, we introduce PrimeVul, a new dataset for training and evaluating code LMs for vulnerability detection. PrimeVul incorporates a novel set of data labeling techniques that achieve comparable label accuracy to human-verified benchmarks while significantly expanding the dataset. It also implements a rigorous data de-duplication and chronological data splitting strategy to mitigate data leakage issues, alongside introducing more realistic evaluation metrics and settings. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a more accurate assessment of code LMs' performance in real-world conditions. Evaluating code LMs on PrimeVul reveals that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate the performance of these models. For instance, a state-of-the-art 7B model scored 68.26\% F1 on BigVul but only 3.09\% F1 on PrimeVul. Attempts to improve performance through advanced training techniques and larger models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were unsuccessful, with results akin to random guessing in the most stringent settings. These findings underscore the considerable gap between current capabilities and the practical requirements for deploying code LMs in security roles, highlighting the need for more innovative research in this domain.

 Abstract:  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly adopted to train agents that can deal with complex sequential tasks, such as driving an autonomous vehicle or controlling a complex environment. Correspondingly, novel approaches are needed to ensure that RL agents have been tested adequately before going to production. Among them, mutation testing is quite promising, especially under the assumption that the injected faults (mutations) mimic the real ones. In this paper, we first describe a taxonomy of real RL faults obtained by repository mining. Then, we present the mutation operators derived from such real faults and implemented in the tool µPRL. Finally, we discuss the experimental results, which show that µPRL is extremely effective at discriminating strong from weak test generators, hence providing useful feedback to developers about the adequacy of the test scenarios generated and executed so far.

 Abstract:  Machine learning (ML) components are increasingly incorporated into software products for end-users, but developers face challenges in transitioning from ML prototypes to products. Academics have limited access to the source of commercial ML products, challenging research progress. In this study, first, we contribute a novel process to identify 262 open-source ML products among more than half a million ML-related projects on GitHub. Then, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 30 open-source ML products to answer six broad research questions about development practices and system architecture. We find that the majority of the ML products in our sample represent startup-style development reported in past interview studies. We report 21 findings, including limited involvement of data scientists in many ML products, unusually low modularity between ML and non-ML code, diverse architectural choices on incorporating models into products, and limited prevalence of industry best practices such as model testing, pipeline automation, and monitoring. Additionally, we discuss 7 implications of this study on research, development, and education, including the need for tools to assist teams without data scientists, education opportunities, and open-source-specific research for privacy-preserving telemetry.

 Abstract:  The Linux kernel is actively-developed and widely-used. It supports billions of devices of all classes, from high-performance computing to the Internet-of-Things, in part because of its sophisticated configuration system, which automatically tailors the source code according to thousands of user-provided configuration options. Fuzzing has been highly successful at finding kernel bugs, being among the top bug reporters. Since the kernel receives 100s of patches per day, fuzzers run continuously, stopping regularly to rebuild the kernel with the latest changes before restarting fuzzing. But kernel fuzzers currently use predefined configuration settings that, as we show, exclude the majority of new patches from the kernel binary, nullifying the benefits of continuous fuzzing. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art configuration testing techniques are generally ill-suited to the needs of continuous fuzzing, excluding necessary options or requiring too many configuration files to be tractible. We distill down the needs of continuous testing into six properties with the most impact, systematically analyze the space of configuration selection strategies, and provide actionable recommendations. Through our analysis, we discover that continuous fuzzers can improve configuration variety without sacrificing performance. We empirically evaluate our discovery by modifying the configuration selection strategy for syzkaller, the most popular Linux kernel fuzzer, which subsequently found more than twice as many new bugs (35 vs. 13) than with the original configuration file and 12x more (24 vs. 2) when considering only unique bugs---with one security vulnerability being assigned a CVE.

 Abstract:  Formal verification is a promising method for producing highly reliable software, but the difficulty of manually writing verification proofs severely limits its utility in practice. Recent methods have automated some proof synthesis by guiding a search through the proof space using machine learning and a theorem prover. Unfortunately, the theorem prover provides only the crudest estimate of progress, resulting in effectively undirected search. This makes proofs hard to find, and, when they are found, longer than necessary. Reinforcement learning could help estimate progress, but sparse rewards make this method ineffective. To address this problem, we create QEDCartographer, an novel automated proof-synthesis tool that combines supervised and reinforcement learning. QEDCartographer's key insight is that incorporating the branching structure of proofs into its learning enables reward-free search, mitigating the sparse reward challenge. We evaluate QEDCartographer on the CoqGym benchmark of 68,501 theorems from 124 open-source Coq projects. QEDCartographer proves 186 more theorems than Proverbot9001, a state-of-the-art proof synthesis tool, an increase of 8%. Further, the tools are complementary, together proving 12% more theorems than Proverbot9001 alone. For theorems both can prove QEDCartographer produces 26% shorter proofs 27% faster.

 Abstract:  A growing trend in compiler design is to enable modular extensions to intermediate representations (IRs). Multi- Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) is a new effort to enable faster compiler development by providing an extensible framework for downstream developers to define custom IRs with MLIR dialects. Sets of MLIR dialects define new IRs that are tailored for specific domains. The diversity and rapid evolution of these IRs make it impractical to pre-define custom test generator logic for every available dialect. We design a new approach called SYNTHFUZZ that automatically infers and applies custom mutations from existing tests. The key essence of SYNTHFUZZ is that inferred custom mutations are parameterized and context-dependent such that they can be concretized differently depending on the target context. By doing this, we obviate the need to manually write custom mutations for newly introduced MLIR dialects. Further, SYNTHFUZZ increases the chance of finding effective edit locations and reduces the chance of inserting invalid edit content by performing k-ancestor- prefix and l-sibling-postfix matching. We compare SYNTHFUZZ to three baselines: Grammarinator—a grammar-based fuzzer without custom mutators, MLIRSmith—a custom test generator for MLIR, and NeuRI—a custom test generator with support for parameterized generation. We conduct this comprehensive comparison on 4 different MLIR projects where each project defines a new set of MLIR dialects that would take months of effort to manually write custom input generation and mutation logic. Our evaluation shows that SYNTHFUZZ on average improves input diversity by 1.51×, which increases branch coverage by 1.16×. Further, we show that our context dependent custom mutation increases the proportion of valid tests by up to 1.11×, indicating that SYNTHFUZZ correctly concretizes its parameterized mutations with respect to the target context. Parameterization of the mutations reduces the fraction of tests violating general MLIR constraints by 0.57×, increasing the time spent fuzzing dialect-specific code.

 Abstract:  With mobile apps playing an increasingly vital role in our daily lives, the importance of ensuring their accessibility for users with disabilities is also growing. Despite this, app developers often overlook the accessibility challenges encountered by users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Screen reader users typically navigate content sequentially, focusing on one element at a time, unaware of changes occurring elsewhere in the app. While dynamic changes to content displayed on an app’s user interface may be apparent to sighted users, they pose significant accessibility obstacles for screen reader users. Existing accessibility testing tools are unable to identify challenges faced by blind users resulting from dynamic content changes. In this work, we first conduct a formative user study on dynamic changes in Android apps and their accessibility barriers for screen reader users. We then present TIMESTUMP, an automated framework that leverages our findings in the formative study to detect accessibility issues regarding dynamic changes. Finally, we empirically evaluate TIMESTUMP on real-world apps to assess its effectiveness and efficiency in detecting such accessibility issues.

 Abstract:  Repository-level code completion aims to generate code for unfinished code snippets within the context of a specified repository. Existing approaches mainly rely on retrieval-augmented generation strategies due to limitations in input sequence length. However, traditional lexical-based retrieval methods like BM25 struggle to capture code semantics, while model-based retrieval methods face challenges due to the lack of labeled data for training. Therefore, we propose RLCoder, a novel reinforcement learning framework, which can enable the retriever to learn to retrieve useful content for code completion without the need for labeled data. Specifically, we iteratively evaluate the usefulness of retrieved content based on the perplexity of the target code when provided with the retrieved content as additional context, and provide feedback to update the retriever parameters. This iterative process enables the retriever to learn from its successes and failures, gradually improving its ability to retrieve relevant and high-quality content. Considering that not all situations require information beyond code files and not all retrieved context is helpful for generation, we also introduce a stop signal mechanism, allowing the retriever to decide when to retrieve and which candidates to retain autonomously. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RLCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval, achieving 12.2\% EM improvement over previous methods. Moreover, experiments show that our framework can generalize across different programming languages and further improve previous methods like RepoCoder.

 Abstract:  Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities. One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect. Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead. This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique. The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations. In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns. We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM. We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect. We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code. We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.

 Abstract:  Android applications are pervasively adopted and heavily relied on in our daily life, leading to the growing demand for enhanced user experiences, such as ease for operation and robustness. Nevertheless, developers continue to prioritize traditional functionality and performance, overlooking the pivotal role of user experience in real-world scenarios. For example, poorly designed page elements can lead to user confusion, resulting in unexpected outcomes, termed as the error-prone operation anomalies (EPAs). In this work, we undertake the first effort to uncover the underlying essence of the EPA problem. To achieve this objective, we investigated the root causes of EPAs from three dimensions, i.e., subject, object and environment. These causes were identified by multi-stage attribute capturing and precise similarity computation. In this process, the causes are categorized into fine-grained classes, namely confusing behaviours, unsuitable layout, and resource overload. Building upon these insights, we propose a dynamic GUI-based testing tool EP-Detector to facilitate detecting the EPAs in real-world apps. The EP-Detector is equipped with widget-exploration based target navigation and automatic test oracle, enabling it to detect error-prone page elements and simulate events with both comprehensiveness and precision. To systematically study the prevalence and severity of real-world EPAs, we conducted experiments on 53 popular Android apps with EP-Detector. The confirmed results not only validate the high precision and completeness of EP-Detector but also highlight that EPAs are prevalent in current apps, with at least one EPA existing in every two page widgets on average, and 28.3% of them may lead to security and functionality issues or risks. The EP-Detector is available at https://github.com/WordDealer/EP-Detector.  
  
  Shuzheng Gao, Cuiyun Gao, Wenchao Gu, Michael Lyu, "Search-Based LLMs for Code Optimization"  
 Abstract:  The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs. These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization. Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue. Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs). These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution. First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs. Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code. To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods. SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods. Our evaluation of SBLLM on a dataset of Python and C++ code demonstrates its effectiveness in improving code efficiency. Specifically, the results indicate that SBLLM can improve program execution efficiency by up to 109.59% and consistently outperform all baseline methods by 8.72% ∼ 28.06% and 1.15% ∼ 9.56% with different LLMs in terms of top-5 speedup rate on Python and C++, respectively.  
  
  Qunhong Zeng, Yuxia Zhang, Zhiqing Qiu, Hui Liu, "A First Look at Conventional Commits Classification"  
 Abstract:  Modern distributed software development relies on commits to control system versions. Commit classification plays a vital role in both industry and academia. The widely-used commit classification framework was proposed in 1976 by Swanson and includes three base classes: perfective, corrective, and adaptive. With the increasing complexity of software development, the industry has shifted towards a more fine-grained commit category, i.e., adopting Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) for delicacy management. The new commit framework requires developers to classify commits into ten distinct categories, such as ``feat'', ``fix'', and ``docs''. However, existing studies mainly focus on the three-category classification, leaving the definition and application of the fine-grained commit categories as knowledge gaps. This paper reports a preliminary study on this mechanism from its application status and problems. We also explore ways to address these identified problems. We find that a growing number of projects on GitHub are adopting CCS. By analyzing 194 issues from GitHub and 100 questions from Stack Overflow about the CCS application, we qualitatively categorized 52 challenges developers encountered. The most common one is CCS-type confusion. To address these challenges, we propose a clear definition of CCS types based on existing variants. Further, we designed an approach to automatically classify commits into CCS types, and the evaluation results demonstrate a promising performance. Our work facilitates a deeper comprehension of the present fine-grained commit categorization and holds the potential to alleviate application challenges significantly.

 Abstract:  Python’s dynamic typing system offers flexibility and expressiveness but can lead to type-related errors, prompting the need for automated type inference despite efforts like Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) to enhance type hinting. While existing learning-based approaches show promising inference accuracy, they struggle with practical challenges in comprehensively handling various types, including complex generics and (unseen) user/library-defined types. To address these challenges, we introduce TIGER, employing a two-stage generating-then-ranking (GTR) framework. By fine-tuning pre-trained code models, TIGER trains a generation model with a generative span masking objective and a similarity model with a contrastive training objective. This enables TIGER to execute the GTR inference, generating diverse candidates and then ranking them alongside user/library-defined types. Evaluation on the ManyTypes4Py dataset demonstrates TIGER’s effectiveness across different type categories, particularly excelling in (unseen) user-defined types (with improvements of 11.2% and 20.1% in Top-5 Exact Match). The evaluation results also confirm the robustness and efficiency of TIGER, highlighting the contributions of the employed two stages.

 Abstract:  Deep Learning (DL) compilers typically load a DL model and optimize it with intermediate representation. Existing DL compiler testing techniques mainly focus on model optimization stages, but rarely explore bug detection at the model loading stage. Effectively testing the model loading stage requires covering diverse usages of each DL operator from various DL libraries, which shares a common objective with DL library testing, indicating that the embedded knowledge in DL library tests could potentially be beneficial for testing the model loading stage of DL compilers. Thus, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of migrating the knowledge embedded in DL library tests to test the model loading stage. To support the conduct of this study, we develop a technique, called OPERA, consisting of test migration (regarding effectiveness investigation) and test prioritization (regarding efficiency investigation). We considered three sources of tests in DL libraries for migration and used eight frontends from three DL compilers (e.g., TVM, TensorRT, and OpenVINO) for evaluation. The migrated tests with the aid of OPERA detected 170 previously unknown bugs in total, 90 of which have been confirmed/fixed by developers demonstrating the effectiveness of such the migration-based idea. The test prioritization strategy in OPERA improves testing efficiency with migrated tests by 11.9%~47.4% on average compared to general test prioritization strategies. Finally, we obtained 7 major findings and provided a set of guidelines for future work from this study.

 Abstract:  Large Language Models (LLMs) have found widespread applications in various domains, including web applications with chatbot interfaces. Aided by an LLM-integration middleware such as LangChain, user prompts are translated into SQL queries used by the LLM to provide meaningful responses to users. However, unsanitized user prompts can lead to SQL injection attacks, potentially compromising the security of the database. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of prompt-to-SQL (P2SQL) injections targeting web applications based on frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. We characterize P2SQL injections, exploring their variants and impact on application security through multiple concrete examples. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating the risks of P2SQL attacks across language models. By employing both manual and automated methods, we discovered P2SQL vulnerabilities in five real-world applications. Our findings indicate that LLM-integrated applications are highly susceptible to P2SQL injection attacks, warranting the adoption of robust defenses. To counter these attacks, we propose four effective defense techniques that can be integrated as extensions to the LangChain framework.

 Abstract:  Large language models for code (i.e., code LLMs) have shown strong code understanding and generation capabilities. To evaluate the capabilities of code LLMs in various aspects, many benchmarks have been proposed (e.g., HumanEval and ClassEval). Code reasoning is one of the most essential abilities of code LLMs, but existing benchmarks for code reasoning are not sufficient. Typically, they focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the evaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as the logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if the prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely REval, for evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with program execution. We utilize existing code benchmarks and adapt them to new benchmarks within our framework. A large-scale empirical study is conducted and most LLMs show unsatisfactory performance on both Runtime Behavior Reasoning (i.e., an average accuracy of 44.4\%) and Incremental Consistency Evaluation (i.e., an average IC score of 10.3). Evaluation results of current code LLMs reflect the urgent need for the community to strengthen the code reasoning capability of code LLMs.

 Abstract:  Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum. Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct). This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine- tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing. In this paper, we propose iAudit, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. Specifically, iAudit is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause. As such, iAudit employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. To evaluate iAudit, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune iAudit. We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b). On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, iAudit achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%. The causes generated by iAudit achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.

 Abstract:  The rapid advancement of blockchain platforms has significantly accelerated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps). Similar to traditional applications, DApps integrate front-end descriptions that showcase their features to attract users, and back-end smart contracts for executing their business logic. However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in front-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can confuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness. In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each exemplified by a real-world DApp. Furthermore, we introduce Hyperion, an approach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end descriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. This method leverages a fine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs dataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. Finally, Hyperion reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns. The experiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that Hyperion reaches 84.06\% overall recall and 92.06\% overall precision in reporting DApp inconsistencies. We also implement Hyperion to analyze 835 real-world DApps. The experimental results show that Hyperion discovers 459 real-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.

 Abstract:  Open-source software (OSS) plays a crucial role in modern software development. Utilizing OSS code can greatly accelerate software development, reduce redundancy, and enhance reliability. Python, a widely adopted programming language, is particularly renowned for its extensive and diverse third-party package ecosystem. However, a significant number of OSS packages within the Python ecosystem are in poor maintenance, leading to potential risks in terms of functionality and security. Consequently, it is essential to establish a deprecation mechanism that assists package developers and users in effectively managing these packages. To facilitate the establishment of the package-level deprecation mechanism, this paper presents a mixed-method empirical study, including data analysis and surveys. We investigate the current practices of announcing, receiving, and handling package-level deprecation in the Python ecosystem. We also assess the benefits of having deprecation announcements for inactively maintained packages. Furthermore, we investigate the challenges faced by package developers and users and their expectations for future deprecation practices. Our findings reveal valuable insights. For instance 75.4\% of inactive package developers have no intention of releasing deprecation declarations for various reasons, while 89.5\% of users express a desire to be notified about the deprecation, highlighting a gap between developers and users; In many cases, no alternative solutions are available when deprecation occurs, emphasizing the need to explore practical approaches that enable seamless package handover and require less maintenance effort. We anticipate that our work will enhance the understanding of existing package-level deprecation patterns within the Python OSS realm and facilitate the development of deprecation practices for the Python community in the future.

 Abstract:  During software development, developers often make numerous modifications to the software to address existing issues or implement new features. However, certain changes may inadvertently have a detrimental impact on the overall system performance. To ensure that the performance of new software releases does not degrade (i.e., absence of performance regressions), existing practices rely on system-level performance testing, such as load testing, or component-level performance testing, such as microbenchmarking, to detect performance regressions. However, performance testing for the entire system is often expensive and time-consuming, posing challenges to adapting to the rapid release cycles common in modern DevOps practices. In addition, system-level performance testing cannot be conducted until the system is fully built and deployed. On the other hand, component-level testing focuses on isolated components, neglecting overall system performance and the impact of system workloads. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models. Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model. We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system. In an evaluation of our approach on two representative open-source benchmark systems, we show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads. More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed. Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.

 Abstract:  Automated unit test generators, particularly search-based software testing tools like EvoSuite, are capable of generating tests with high coverage. Although these generators alleviate the burden of writing unit tests, they often pose challenges for software engineers in terms of understanding the generated tests. To address this, we introduce UTGen, which combines search-based software testing and large language models to enhance the understandability of automatically generated test cases. We achieve this enhancement through contextualizing test data, improving identifier naming, and adding descriptive comments. Through a controlled experiment with 32 participants, we investigate how the understandability of unit tests affects a software engineer's ability to perform bug-fixing tasks. We selected bug-fixing to simulate a real-world scenario that emphasizes the importance of understandable test cases. We observe that participants working on assignments with test cases fix up to 33% more bugs and use up to 20\% less time when compared to baseline test cases. From the post-test questionnaire, we gathered that participants found that enhanced test names, test data, and variable names improved their bug-fixing process.  
  
  Sebastian Uchitel, Francisco Cirelli, Dalal Alrajeh, "Unavoidable Boundary Conditions: A Control Perspective on Goal Conflicts"  
 Abstract:  Boundary Conditions (BCs) express situations under which requirements specifications conflict. They are used within a broader conflict management process to produce less idealized specifications. Several approaches have been proposed to identify BCs automatically. Some introduce a prioritization criteria to reduce the number of BCs presented to an engineer. However, identifying the few, relevant boundary conditions remains an open challenge. In this paper, we argue that one of the problems of the state of the art is with the definition of BC itself -- it is too weak. We propose a stronger definition for the few, relevant BCs, which we refer to as Unavoidable Boundary Conditions (UBCs), which utilizes the notion of realizability in reactive synthesis. We show experimentally that UBCs non-trivially reduce the number of conditions produced by existing BC identification techniques. We also relate UBCs to existing concepts in reactive synthesis used to provide feedback for unrealizable specifications (including counter-strategies and unrealizable cores). We then show that UBCs provide a targeted form of feedback for repairing unrealizable specifications.  
  
  Brian Hyeongseok Kim, Jingbo Wang, Chao Wang, "FairQuant: Certifying and Quantifying Fairness of Deep Neural Networks"  
 Abstract:  We propose a method for formally certifying and quantifying individual fairness of a deep neural network (DNN). Individual fairness guarantees that any two individuals who are identical except for some protected input attribute (e.g., gender or race) receive the same treatment. While there are existing techniques that provide such a guarantee, they suffer from lack of scalability or accuracy as the size and input dimension of the DNN increase. Our method overcomes this limitation by applying abstraction to a symbolic interval based analysis of the DNN followed by iterative refinement guided by the fairness property. Furthermore, our method lifts the interval based analysis from the conventional qualitative certification to quantitative certification, by computing the percentage of individuals whose classification outputs are provably fair, instead of merely deciding if the DNN is fair. We have implemented our method and evaluated it on deep neural networks trained on five popular fairness research datasets. The experimental results show that our method is not only more accurate than state-of-the-art techniques but also several orders-of-magnitude faster.  
  
  Mingyuan Wu, Jiahong Xiang, Kunqiu Chen, Peng DI, Shin Hwei Tan, Heming Cui, Yuqun Zhang, "Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole: How do Assisting Exploration Strategies Facilitate Grey-box Fuzzing?"  
 Abstract:  Many assisting exploration strategies have been proposed to assist grey-box fuzzers in exploring program states guarded by tight and complex branch conditions such as equality constraints. Although they have shown promising results in their original papers, their evaluations seldom follow equivalent protocols, e.g., they are rarely evaluated on identical benchmarks. Moreover, there is a lack of sufficient investigations on the specifics of the program states explored by these strategies which can obfuscate the future application and development of such strategies. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive study of assisting exploration strategies on their effectiveness, versatility, and limitations to enlighten their future development. To this end, we perform the first comprehensive study about the assisting exploration strategies for grey-box fuzzers. Specifically, we first collect nine recent fuzzers representing the mainstream assisting exploration strategies as our studied subjects and 21 real-world projects to form our benchmark suite. After evaluating the subjects on the benchmark suite, we then surprisingly find that the dictionary strategy is the most promising since it not only achieves similar or even slightly better performance over the other studied assisting exploration strategies in terms of exploring program states but also is more practical to be enhanced. Accordingly, we propose CDFUZZ, which generates a customized dictionary for each seed upon the baseline fuzzer AFL to improve over the original dictionary strategy. The evaluation results demonstrate that CDFUZZ increases the edge coverage by 16.1% on average for all benchmark projects over the best performer in our study (i.e., AFL++ with the dictionary strategy). CDFUZZ also successfully exposed 37 previously unknown bugs, with nine confirmed and seven fixed by the corresponding developers.

 Abstract:  Proof-oriented programs mix computational content with proofs of program correctness. However, the human effort involved in programming and proving is still substantial, despite the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to automate proofs in languages such as F*. Seeking to spur research on using AI to automate the construction of proof-oriented programs, we curate a dataset of 600K lines of open-source F* programs and proofs, including software used in production systems ranging from Windows and Linux, to Python and Firefox. Our dataset includes around 32K top-level F* definitions, each representing a type-directed program and proof synthesis problem---producing a definition given a formal specification expressed as an F* type. We provide a program-fragment checker that queries F* to check the correctness of candidate solutions. We believe this is the largest corpus of SMT-assisted program proofs coupled with a reproducible program-fragment checker. Grounded in this dataset, we investigate the use of AI to synthesize programs and their proofs in F*, with promising results. Our main finding in that the performance of fine-tuned smaller language models (such as Phi-2 or StarCoder) compare favorably with large language models (such as GPT-4), at a much lower computational cost. We also identify various type-based retrieval augmentation techniques and find that they boost performance significantly. With detailed error analysis and case studies, we identify potential strengths and weaknesses of models and techniques and suggest directions for future improvements.

 Abstract:  Deep learning (DL) libraries are widely used to form the basis of various AI applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and software engineering domains. Despite their popularity, DL libraries are known to have vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and integer overflows, that can be exploited to compromise the security or effectiveness of the underlying libraries. While traditional fuzzing techniques have been used to find bugs in software, they are not well-suited for DL libraries. In general, the complexity of DL libraries and the diversity of their APIs make it challenging to test them thoroughly. To date, mainstream DL libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch have featured over 1,000 APIs, and the number of APIs is still growing. Fuzzing all these APIs is a daunting task, especially when considering the complexity of the input data and the diversity of the API usage patterns. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have illustrated the high potential of LLMs in understanding and synthesizing human-like code. Despite their high potential, we find that emerging LLM-based fuzzers are less optimal for DL library API fuzzing, given their lack of in-depth knowledge on API input edge cases and inefficiency in generating test inputs. In this paper, we propose DFUZZ, a LLM-driven DL library fuzzing approach. We have two key insights: (1) With high reasoning ability, LLMs can replace human experts to reason edge cases (likely error-triggering inputs) from checks in an API's code, and transfer the extracted knowledge to test other (new or rarely-tested) APIs. (2) With high generation ability, LLMs can synthesize initial test programs with high accuracy that automates API testing. DFUZZ provides LLMs with a novel ''white-box view'' of DL library APIs, and therefore, can leverage LLMs' reasoning and generation abilities to achieve comprehensive fuzzing. Our experimental results on popular DL libraries demonstrate that DFUZZ is able to cover more APIs than SOTA (LLM-based) fuzzers on TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively. Moreover, DFUZZ successfully detected 37 bugs, with 17 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs.

 Abstract:  Utilizing code snippets on Stack Overflow (SO) is a common practice among developers for problem-solving. Although SO code snippets serve as valuable resources, it is important to acknowledge their imperfections, reusing problematic code snippets can lead to the introduction of suboptimal or buggy code into software projects. \textit{SO comments} often point out weaknesses of a post and provide valuable insights to improve the quality of answers, while SO comments are usually missed and/or ignored, leaving these problematic code snippets untouched. In this work, we first investigate the task of automatic SO posts updating based on their associated comments. We introduce a novel framework, named \textbf{Soup} (\textbf{\underline{S}}tack \textbf{\underline{O}}verflow \textbf{\underline{U}}pdator for \textbf{\underline{P}}ost) for this task. \textbf{Soup} addresses two key tasks: Valid Comment-Edit Prediction (VCP) and Automatic Post Updating (APU). We fine-tuned a large language model, CodeLlama, using low-rank adaptation techniques to complete the VCP task, and constructed a dataset containing 78k valid comment-edit pairs for the APU task. Subsequently, we tested the performance of multiple large language models on the APU task. Extensive experimental results show the promising performance of our model over a set of benchmarks. Moreover, we also perform an in-the-wild evaluation on Stack Overflow, we submitted 50 edits generated by our approach to Stack Overflow posts and 21 of them have been verified and accepted by SO maintainers, further proving the practical value of \textbf{Soup}.

 Abstract:  JVM fuzzing techniques serve as a cornerstone for guaranteeing the quality of implementations. In typical fuzzing workflows, initial seeds are crucial as they form the basis of the process. Literature in traditional program fuzzing has confirmed that effectiveness is largely impacted by redundancy among initial seeds, thereby proposing a series of seed selection methods. JVM fuzzing, compared to traditional ones, presents unique characteristics, including large-scale and intricate code, and programs with both syntactic and semantic features. However, it remains unclear whether the existing initial seed selection methods are suitable for JVM fuzzing and whether utilizing program features can enhance effectiveness. To address this, we devised a total of 10 initial seed selection methods, comprising coverage-based, prefuzz-based, and program-feature-based methods. We then conducted an empirical study on three JVM implementations to extensively evaluate the performance of the initial seed selection methods within two state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques (JavaTailor and VECT). Specifically, we examine performance from three aspects: (i) effectiveness and efficiency using widely studied initial seeds, (ii) effectiveness using the programs in the wild, and (iii) the ability to detect new bugs. Evaluation results first show that the program-feature-based method that utilizes the control flow graph not only has a significantly lower time overhead (i.e., 30s), but also outperforms other methods, achieving 142% to 269% improvement compared to the full set of initial seeds. Second, results reveal that the initial seed selection greatly improves the quality of wild programs and exhibits complementary effectiveness by detecting new behaviors. Third, results demonstrate that given the same testing period, initial seed selection improves the JVM fuzzing techniques by detecting more unknown bugs. Particularly, 16 out of the 25 detected bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers. This work takes the first look at initial seed selection in JVM fuzzing, confirming its importance in fuzzing effectiveness and efficiency.

 Abstract:  To support software developers in understanding and maintaining programs, various automatic (source) code summarization techniques have been proposed to generate a concise natural language summary (i.e., comment) for a given code snippet. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of code-related tasks. In this paper, we undertake a systematic and comprehensive study on code summarization in the era of LLMs, which covers multiple aspects involved in the workflow of LLM-based code summarization. Specifically, we begin by examining prevalent automated evaluation methods for assessing the quality of summaries generated by LLMs and find that the results of the GPT-4 evaluation method are most closely aligned with human evaluation. Then, we explore the effectiveness of five prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, critique, and expert) in adapting LLMs to code summarization tasks. Contrary to expectations, advanced prompting techniques may not outperform simple zero-shot prompting. Next, we investigate the impact of LLMs' model settings (including top\_p and temperature parameters) on the quality of generated summaries. We find the impact of the two parameters on summary quality varies by the base LLM and programming language, but their impacts are similar. Moreover, we canvass LLMs' abilities to summarize code snippets in distinct types of programming languages. The results reveal that LLMs perform suboptimally when summarizing code written in logic programming languages compared to other language types (e.g., procedural and object-oriented programming languages). Finally, we unexpectedly find that \codellama{} with 7B parameters can outperform advanced GPT-4 in generating summaries describing code implementation details and asserting code properties. We hope that our findings can provide a comprehensive understanding of code summarization in the era of LLMs.

 Abstract:  Large language models have catalyzed an unprecedented wave in code generation. While achieving significant advances, they blur the distinctions between machine- and human-authored source code, causing integrity and authenticity issues of software artifacts. Previous methods such as DetectGPT have proven effective in discerning machine-generated texts, but they do not identify and harness the unique patterns of machine-generated code. Thus, its applicability falters when applied to code. In this paper, we carefully study the specific patterns that characterize machine and human-authored code. Through a rigorous analysis of code attributes such as lexical diversity, conciseness, and naturalness, we expose unique patterns inherent to each source. We particularly notice that the syntactic segmentation of code is a critical factor in identifying its provenance. Based on our findings, we propose a novel machine-generated code detection method called DetectCodeGPT, which improves DetectGPT by capturing the distinct stylized patterns of code. Diverging from conventional techniques that depend on external LLMs for perturbations, DetectCodeGPT perturbs the code corpus by strategically inserting spaces and newlines, ensuring both efficacy and efficiency. Experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting machine-generated code.

 Abstract:  State-of-the-art drone path planners enable drones to autonomously navigate around obstacles in GPS-denied, uncharted and cluttered environments. However, our investigation shows that path planners fail to maneuver drones correctly in specific scenarios, leading to incidents such as collisions. To minimize such risks, drone path planners should be tested thoroughly against diverse scenarios before deployment. Existing research for testing drones to uncover safety-critical vulnerabilities is only focused on the flight control programs and is limited in the capability to generate diverse obstacle scenarios for testing drone path planners. In this work, we propose \textit{DPFuzzer}, an automated framework for testing drone path planners. \textit{DPFuzzer} is an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based testing framework. It aims to uncover vulnerabilities in drone path planners by generating diverse critical scenarios that can trigger vulnerabilities. To better guide the critical scenario generation, we introduce \textit{Environmental Risk Factor (ERF)}, a metric we propose, to abstract potential safety threats of scenarios. We evaluate \textit{DPFuzzer} on state-of-the-art drone path planners and the experimental result shows that \textit{DPFuzzer} can effectively find diverse vulnerabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that these vulnerabilities are exploitable in the real world on commercial drones.

 Abstract:  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained significant attention in recent years. As RL software becomes more complex and infiltrates critical application domains, ensuring its quality and correctness becomes increasingly important. An indispensable aspect of software quality/correctness insurance is testing. However, testing RL software faces unique challenges compared to testing traditional software, due to the difficulty on defining the outputs’ correctness. This leads to the RL test oracle problem. Current approaches to testing RL software often rely on human oracles, i.e. convening human experts to judge the correctness of RL software outputs. This heavily depends on the availability and quality (including the experiences, subjective states, etc.) of the human experts, and cannot be fully automated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to design test oracles for RL software by leveraging the Lyapunov stability control theory. By incorporating Lyapunov stability concepts to guide RL training, we hypothesize that a correctly implemented RL software shall output an agent that respects Lyapunov stability control theories. Based on this heuristics, we propose a Lyapunov stability control theory based oracle, LPEA(ϑ, θ), for testing RL software. We conduct extensive experiments over representative RL algorithms and RL software bugs to evaluate our proposed oracle. The results show that our proposed oracle can outperform the human oracle in most metrics. Particularly, LPEA(ϑ = 100%, θ = 75%) outperforms the human oracle by 53.6%, 50%, 18.4%, 34.8%, 18.4%, 127.8%, 60.5%, 38.9%, and 31.7% respectively on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, and ROC curve’s AUC; and LPEA(ϑ = 100%, θ = 50%) outperforms the human oracle by 48.2%, 47.4%, 10.5%, 29.1%, 10.5%, 127.8%, 60.5%, 22.2%, and 26.0% respectively on these metrics.

 Abstract:  Pre-trained large deep learning models are now serving as the dominant component for downstream middleware users and have revolutionized the learning paradigm, replacing the traditional approach of training from scratch locally. To reduce development costs, developers often integrate third-party pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) into their intelligent software systems. However, utilizing untrusted DNNs presents significant security risks, as these models may contain intentional backdoor defects resulting from the black-box training process. These backdoor defects can be activated by hidden triggers, allowing attackers to maliciously control the model and compromise the overall reliability of the intelligent software. To ensure the safe adoption of DNNs in critical software systems, it is crucial to establish a backdoor defect database for localization studies. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing \emph{BDefects4NN}, the first backdoor defect database, which provides labeled backdoor-defected DNNs at the neuron granularity and enables controlled localization studies of defect root causes. In \emph{BDefects4NN}, we define three defect injection rules and employ four representative backdoor attacks across four popular network architectures and three widely adopted datasets, yielding a comprehensive database of 1,654 backdoor-defected DNNs with four defect quantities and varying infected neurons. Based on \emph{BDefects4NN}, we conduct extensive experiments on evaluating six fault localization criteria and two defect repair techniques, which show limited effectiveness for backdoor defects. Additionally, we investigate backdoor-defected models in practical scenarios, specifically in lane detection for autonomous driving and large language models (LLMs), revealing potential threats and highlighting current limitations in precise defect localization. This paper aims to raise awareness of the threats brought by backdoor defects in our community and inspire future advancements in fault localization methods.

 Abstract:  Developers rely on the Rust programming language's static safety guarantees to write secure and performant applications. However, Rust is frequently used to interoperate with other languages which allow design patterns that conflict with Rust's aliasing models. Miri is the only dynamic analysis tool capable of validating applications against these models, but it does not support foreign functions, indicating that there may be a critical correctness gap at the heart of the Rust ecosystem. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of multi-language Rust libraries to determine whether Miri's dynamic analyses remain useful in this context. We used Miri and an LLVM interpreter to jointly execute multi-language applications, where we found 48 instances of undefined or undesired behavior. These include three bugs from libraries that had over 10,000 daily downloads on average during our observation period, and one from a library maintained by the Rust Project. Many of the errors we found involved incompatible aliasing patterns, but Rust's latest Tree Borrows aliasing model was significantly more permissive than the earlier Stacked Borrows model. The Rust community must invest in new, production-ready tooling for multi-language applications to ensure that developers can detect these errors.

 Abstract:  Document databases are increasingly popular in various applications, but their queries are challenging to write due to the flexible and complex data model underlying document databases. This paper presents a synthesis technique that aims to generate document database queries from input-output examples automatically. A new domain-specific language is designed to express a representative set of document database queries in an algebraic style. Furthermore, the synthesis technique leverages a novel abstraction of collections for deduction to efficiently prune the search space and quickly generate the target query. An evaluation of 110 benchmarks from various sources shows that the proposed technique can synthesize 108 benchmarks successfully. On average, the synthesizer can generate document database queries from a small number of input-output examples within tens of seconds.

 Abstract:  The development of high-quality software depends on precise and comprehensive requirements that meet the objectives of stakeholders. Goal modeling techniques have been developed to fill this gap by capturing and analyzing stakeholders' needs and allowing them to make trade-off decisions; yet, goal modeling analysis is often difficult for stakeholders to interpret. Recent work found that when subjects are given minimal training on goal modeling and access to a color visualization, called EVO, they are able to use EVO to make goal modeling decisions faster without compromising quality. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of the empirical evidence for EVO and question the underlying color choices made by the initial designers of EVO. We conduct a pseudo-exact replication ($n = 60$) of the original EVO study, varying the experimental site and the study population. Even in our heterogeneous sample with less a priori familiarity with requirements and goal modeling, we find that individuals using EVO answered the goal-modeling questions significantly faster than those using the control, expanding the external validity of the original results. However, we find some evidence that the chosen color scheme is not intuitive and make recommendations for the goal modeling community.

 Abstract:  Rust provides an exciting combination of strong safety guarantees and high performance. Many new systems are being implemented in Rust. Nevertheless, there is a large body of existing C code that could greatly benefit from Rust's safety guarantees. Unfortunately, the manual effort required to rewrite C code into Rust is often prohibitively expensive. Researchers have explored tools to assist developers in translating legacy C code into Rust code. However, the mismatch between C abstractions and idiomatic Rust abstractions makes it challenging to automatically utilize Rust's language features, resulting in non-idiomatic Rust code that requires extensive manual effort to further refactor. For example, existing tools often fail to map polymorphic uses of void pointers in C to Rust's more idiomatic generic pointers. In this paper, we present a translation tool, GenC2Rust, that translates non-generic C code into generic Rust code. GenC2Rust statically analyzes the use of void pointers in the C program to compute the typing constraints and then retypes the void pointers into generic pointers. We conducted an evaluation of GenC2Rust across 42 C programs that vary in size and span multiple domains to demonstrate its scalability as well as correctness. We also present a detailed analysis of the limiting factors encountered in the translation process.

 Abstract:  Ensuring the reliability of the Rust compiler is of paramount importance, as the Rust language is increasingly being adopted for developing critical systems due to its emphasis on memory and thread safety. However, due to Rust’s complex syntax and strict requirements, generating valid test programs for the Rust compiler poses significant challenges. Currently, with the growing popularity of large language models (LLMs), much research in software testing has explored the use of LLMs to generate test cases. Despite this, directly using LLMs to generate Rust programs often results in a large number of invalid test cases. Existing studies have indicated that test cases triggering historical compiler bugs can assist in software testing. Our investigation into Rust compiler bug issues further supports this observation. Inspired by existing work and our empirical research, we introduce a bracket-based masking and filling strategy called clozeMask. The clozeMask strategy involves extracting test code from historical issue reports, identifying and masking code snippets with specific structures, and utilizing an LLM to fill in the masked portions for synthesizing new test programs. This approach harnesses the generative capabilities of LLMs while retaining the ability to trigger Rust compiler bugs. Ultimately, it enables comprehensive testing of the compiler’s behavior, particularly in exploring corner cases. We implemented our approach as a prototype CLOZEMASTER. CLOZEMASTER has identified 27 confirmed bugs for rustc and mrustc, of which 10 have been fixed by developers. Furthermore, our experimental results indicate that CLOZEMASTER outperforms existing generative fuzzers in terms of code coverage and effectiveness.

 Abstract:  As the default package manager for Node.js, npm has become one of the largest package management systems in the world. To facilitate dependency management for developers, npm supports a special type of dependency, Peer Dependency, whose installation and usage differ from regular dependencies. However, conflicts between peer dependencies can trap the npm client into infinite loops, leading to resource exhaustion and system crashes. We name this problem PeerSpin. Although PeerSpin poses a severe risk to ecosystems, it was overlooked by previous studies, and its impacts have not been explored. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts the first in-depth study to understand and detect PeerSpin in the npm ecosystem. First, by systematically analyzing the npm dependency resolution, we identify the root cause of PeerSpin and characterize two peer dependency patterns to guide detection. Second, we propose a novel technique called Node-Replacement-Conflict based PeerSpin Detection, which leverages the state of the directory tree during dependency resolution to achieve accurate and efficient PeerSpin detection. Based on this technique, we developed a tool called PeerChecker to detect PeerSpin. Finally, we apply PeerChecker to the entire NPM ecosystem and find that 5,662 packages, totaling 72,968 versions, suffer from PeerSpin. Up until now, we confirmed 28 real PeerSpin problems by reporting them to the package maintainer. We also open source all PeerSpin analysis implementations, tools, and data sets to the public to help the community detect PeerSpin issues and enhance the reliability of the npm ecosystem.

 Abstract:  Pre-deployment testing has become essential to ensure the functional correctness of smart contracts. However, since smart contracts are stateful programs integrating many different functionalities, manually writing test cases to cover all potential usages requires significant effort from developers, leading to insufficient testing and increasing risks in practice. Although several testing techniques for smart contracts have been proposed, they primarily focus on detecting common low-level vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy, rather than generating expressive and function-relevant test cases that can reduce manual testing efforts. To bridge the gap, we propose SolMigrator, an automated technique designed to generate expressive and representative test cases for smart contracts. To our knowledge, SolMigrator is the first migration-based test generation technique for smart contracts, which extracts test cases from real-world usages of on-chain contracts and migrates them to test newly developed smart contracts with similar functionalities. Given a target smart contract to be tested and an on-chain similar source smart contract, SolMigrator first transforms the on-chain usage of the source contract into off-chain executable test cases based on on-chain transaction replay and dependency analysis. It then employs fine-grained static analysis to migrate the augmented test cases from the source to the target smart contract. We built a prototype of SolMigrator and have evaluated it on real-world smart contracts within the two most popular categories, ERC20 and ERC721. Our evaluation results demonstrate that SolMigrator effectively extracts test cases from existing on-chain smart contracts and accurately migrates them across different smart contracts, achieving an average precision of 96.3% and accuracy of 93.6%. Furthermore, the results indicate that these migrated test cases effectively cover common key functionalities of the target smart contracts. This provides promising evidence that real-world usages of existing smart contracts can be transformed into effective test cases for other newly developed smart contracts.

 Abstract:  Given a list L of elements and a property ψ that L exhibits, ddmin is a classic test input minimization algorithm that aims to automatically remove ψ-irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm has been widely adopted in domains such as test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD a variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved stateof- the-art performance. By employing Bayesian optimization ProbDD estimates the probability of each element in L being relevant to ψ, and statistically decides which and how many elements should be deleted together each time. However, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is rather intricate, and the underlying details for the superior performance of ProbDD have not been adequately explored. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying the trends in probability and subset size changes and simplifying the probability model. We complement this analysis with empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and examinations of trade-offs and limitations, to further comprehend and demystify this state-of- the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis reveals how ProbDD effectively addresses bottlenecks that slow down ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study illustrates that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms. Based on the findings above, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing the complexity in both theory and implementation. CDD assists in 1 validating the correctness of our key findings, e.g., that probabilities in ProbDD essentially serve as monotonically increasing counters for each element, and 2 identifying the main factors that truly contribute to ProbDD’s superior performance. Our comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating demonstrate that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD, despite being much simplified.

 Abstract:  Security vulnerabilities impose significant costs on users and organizations. Detecting and addressing these vulnera bilities early is crucial to avoid exploits and reduce development costs. Recent studies have shown that deep learning models can effectively detect security vulnerabilities. Yet, little research explores how to adapt these models from benchmark tests to practical applications, and whether they can be useful in practice. This paper presents the first empirical study of a vulnerability detection and fix tool with professional software developers on real projects that they own. We implemented DEEPVULGUARD, an IDE-integrated tool based on state-of-the-art detection and fix models, and show that it has promising performance on bench marks of historic vulnerability data. DEEPVULGUARD scans code for vulnerabilities (including identifying the vulnerability type and vulnerable region of code), suggests fixes, provides natural- language explanations for alerts and fixes, leveraging chat inter faces. We recruited 17 professional software developers, observed their usage of the tool on their code, and conducted interviews to assess the tool’s usefulness, speed, trust, relevance, and workflow integration. We also gathered detailed qualitative feedback on users’ perceptions and their desired features. Study participants scanned a total of 24 projects, 6.9k files, and over 1.7 million lines of source code, and generated 170 alerts and 50 fix suggestions. We find that although state-of-the-art AI-powered detection and fix tools show promise, they are not yet practical for real-world use due to a high rate of false positives and non-applicable fixes. User feedback reveals several actionable pain points, ranging from incomplete context to lack of customization for the user’s codebase. Additionally, we explore how AI features, including confidence scores, explanations, and chat interaction, can apply to vulnerability detection and fixing. Based on these insights, we offer practical recommendations for evaluating and deploying AI detection and fix models.

 Abstract:  Test oracles play a crucial role in software testing enabling effective bug detection. Despite initial promise, neural methods for automated test oracle generation often result in a large number of false positives and weaker test oracles. While LLMs have shown impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including code generation, test case creation and bug fixing, there remains a notable absence of large-scale studies exploring their effectiveness in test oracle generation. The question of whether LLMs can address the challenges in effective oracle generation is both compelling and requires thorough investigation. In this research, we present the first comprehensive study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in generating correct diverse, and strong test oracles capable of effectively identifying a large number of unique bugs. To this end, we fine-tuned seven code LLMs using six distinct prompts on a large dataset consisting of 110 Java projects. Utilizing the most effective fine- tuned LLM and prompt pair, we introduce TOGLL, a novel LLM-based method for test oracle generation. To investigate the generalizability of TOGLL, we conduct studies on 25 unseen large-scale Java projects. Besides assessing the correctness, we also assess the diversity and strength of the generated oracles. We compare the results against EvoSuite and the state-of-the-art neural method, TOGA. Our findings reveal that TOGLL can produce 3.8 times more correct assertion oracles and 4.9 times more exception oracles. Regarding bug detection effectiveness, TOGLL can detect 1,023 unique mutants that EvoSuite cannot, which is ten times more than what the previous SOTA neural-based method, TOGA, can detect. Additionally, TOGLL significantly outperforms TOGA in detecting real bugs from the Defects4J dataset.

Furthermore, we address a critical gap in the research community by introducing E2EBENCH, a new benchmark for automatically assessing the feature coverage of E2E test suites. Our evaluation on E2EBENCH demonstrates that AUTOE2E achieves an average feature coverage of 79%, outperforming the best baseline by 558%, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality, comprehensive test cases.

 Abstract:  Commit messages provide descriptions of the modifications made in a commit using natural language, making them crucial for software maintenance and evolution. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their use in generating high-quality commit messages, such as the Omniscient Message Generator (OMG). This method employs GPT-4 to produce state-of-the-art commit messages. However, the use of proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 in coding tasks raises privacy and sustainability concerns, which may hinder their industrial adoption. Considering that open-source LLMs have achieved competitive performance in developer tasks such as compiler validation, this study investigates whether they can be used to generate commit messages that are comparable with OMG. Our experiments show that an open-source LLM can generate commit messages that are comparable to those produced by OMG. In addition, through a series of contextual refinements, we propose lOcal MessagE GenerAtor (OMEGA) , a CMG approach that uses a 4-bit quantized 8B open-source LLM. OMEGA produces state-of-the-art commit messages, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 in practitioners' preference.

 Abstract:  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in code generation tasks. However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes. Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models. Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models. However, there are three main gaps to objectively evaluate the real capability of LLMs: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability. The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been exposed during the training phase of LLM, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised. The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before. Thus, the fundamental idea using in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL. We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code. Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies. We evaluate four LLMs on OBFUSEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code. The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5\%.  
  
  " Baoquan Cui, rong qu, Zhen Tang, "Jian Zhang, ""Static Analysis of Remote Procedure Call in Java Programs""  
 Abstract:  The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is commonly used for inter-process communications over network, allowing a program to invoke a procedure in another address space even another machine as if it were a local call within the same address space. Its convenience comes from encapsulating network communication. However, for the same reason, it cannot be penetrated by current static analyzers. Since the RPC programs/frameworks play a more important role in various domains, the static analysis of RPC is significant and cannot be ignored. We have observed that many of the existing RPC frameworks/programs written in Java are based on explicit protocols, which makes them possible to be modelled for static analysis. The challenges are how to identify RPC operations in different frameworks/programs and how to automatically establish relationships between clients and servers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, RPCBridge, which uses an adapter to unify the most basic operations during the RPC process. It models the RPC with logic rules in a straightforward and precise way based on its semantics, performs points-to analysis and constructs RPC edges in the call graph, making it more complete. The evaluation on real-world large-scale Java programs based on 5 common RPC frameworks shows that our approach can effectively capture the operations of the RPC (263 matched protocols and 1,098 RPCs), and construct critical links (2,578 edges in the call graph) between clients and servers, in which 60.1% are the true caller-callee pairs after execution. Our approach is expected to bring significant benefits (+24.3% leakage paths for the taint analyzer) for previously incompletely modelled code with a very little memory and time overhead, and connect the modules in a system, so that it can be statically analyzed more holistically.  
  
  " Shihao Zhu, Yuqi Guo, Yan Cai, Bin Liang, Long Zhang, Rui Chen, "Tingting Yu, ""Reduce Dependence for Sound Concurrency Bug Prediction""  
 Abstract:  Recently, dynamic concurrency bug predictions have kept making notable progress in improving concurrency coverage while ensuring soundness. Most of them rely solely on dynamic information in traces and overlook the static semantics of the program when predicting bugs. To ensure soundness, they assume that \textbf{any (memory) read can fully affect subsequent program execution via control-flow and data-flow}. However, the assumption over-approximates constraints among (memory) writes and reads and hence limits reordering space over thread interleaving, ultimately leading to false negatives. From program semantics, only a subset of reads actually affect their subsequent executions. Therefore, by refining dependencies between reads and subsequent executions based on static program semantics one can refine the assumption and eliminate unnecessary constraints while still guaranteeing soundness. This can bring a chance to explore more thread interleaving space and uncover more concurrency bugs. However, refining dependencies can compromise soundness and bring heavy overhead. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces the concept of Necessary Consistent Read Event (NRE) and a hybrid analysis algorithm. NRE refines dependencies between reads and their subsequent events and is used to identify necessary constraints where a read probably affects the execution of its subsequent events. Next, we design an efficient and accurate hybrid analysis algorithm to calculate NREs for each event in the trace. The hybrid analysis algorithm maps events to program SSA instructions and simulates executions based on the original trace. We focused on data race and developed NRE and the algorithm as a prototype tool ReconP on top of a recent work M2. We conducted a set of comparative experiments on MySQL with M2 and SeqCheck. The results show that ReconP can detect 46.9\% and 22.4\% more data races than M2 and SeqCheck, respectively. And the hybrid algorithm only accounts for 34\% of the total time cost.  
  
  " Huaijin Wang, Zhibo Liu, Yanbo Dai, Shuai Wang, Qiyi Tang, Sen Nie, "Shi Wu, ""Preserving Privacy in Software Composition Analysis: A Study of Technical Solutions and Enhancements""  
 Abstract:  Software composition analysis (SCA) denotes the process of identifying open-source software components in an input software application. SCA has been extensively developed and adopted by academia and industry. However, we notice that the modern SCA techniques in industry scenarios still need to be improved due to privacy concerns. Overall, SCA requires the users to upload their applications’ source code to a remote SCA server, which then deeply inspects the applications and reports the component usage to users. This process is privacy-sensitive since the applications may contain sensitive information, such as proprietary algorithms, trade secrets, and user data. Moreover applications' source code is generally deemed proprietary, and users do not want to share it with the SCA vendor. To protect customers' privacy, contemporary SCA vendors often propose to deploy a "lite" version of SCA service on the customer side. To avoid the leakage of SCA vendors' valuable assets (e.g., code model, and data), the "lite" SCA usually only performs a shallow analysis with limited accuracy. Privacy concerns have prevented the SCA technology from being used in real-world scenarios. Therefore, academia and the industry demand privacy-preserving SCA solutions. For the first time, we analyze the privacy requirements of SCA and provide a landscape depicting possible technical solutions with varying privacy gains and overheads. In particular, given that de facto SCA frameworks are primarily driven by code similarity-based techniques, we explore combining several privacy-preserving protocols to encapsulate the similarity-based SCA framework. Among all viable solutions, we find that multi-party computation (MPC) offers the strongest privacy guarantee and plausible accuracy; it, however, incurs high overhead ($184\times$). We optimize the MPC-based SCA framework by reducing the amount of crypto protocol transactions using program analysis techniques. The evaluation results show that our proposed optimizations can reduce the MPC-based SCA overhead to only 8.5% without sacrificing SCA’s privacy guarantee or accuracy.

 Abstract:  As embedded devices become increasingly popular, monolithic firmware, known for its execution efficiency and simplicity, is widely used in resource-constrained devices. Different from ordinary firmware, the monolithic firmware image is packed without the file that indicates its format, which challenges the reverse engineering of monolithic firmware. Function identification is the prerequisite of monolithic firmware's analysis. Prior works on function identification are less effectiveness when applied to monolithic firmware due to their heavy reliance on file formats. In this paper, we propose Moye, a novel method to identify functions in monolithic firmware. We leverage the important insight that the use of registers must conform to some constraints. In particular, our approach segments the firmware, locate code sections and output the instructions. We uses a masked language model to learn hiding relationships among the instructions to identify the function boundaries. We evaluate Moye using 1,318 monolithic firmware images, including 48 samples collected from widely used devices. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms current works, achieving a precision greater than 98% and a recall rate greater than 97% across most datasets, showing robustness to complicated compilation options.  
  
  Haifeng Ruan, Yuntong Zhang, Abhik Roychoudhury, "SpecRover: Code Intent Extraction via LLMs"  
 Abstract:  Autonomous program improvement typically involves automatically producing bug fixes and feature additions. Such program improvement can be accomplished by a combination of large language model (LLM) and program analysis capabilities, in the form of an LLM agent. Since program repair or program improvement typically requires a specification of intended behavior - specification inference can be useful for producing high quality program patches. In this work, we examine efficient and low-cost workflows for iterative specification inference within an LLM agent. Given a GitHub issue to be resolved in a software project, our goal is to conduct iterative code search accompanied by specification inference - thereby inferring intent from both the project structure and behavior. The intent thus captured is examined by a reviewer agent with the goal of vetting the patches as well as providing a measure of confidence in the vetted patches. Our approach SpecRover is built on the open-source LLM agent AutoCodeRover. In an evaluation on the full SWE-Bench consisting of 2294 GitHub issues, it shows more than 50% improvement in efficacy over AutoCodeRover. Compared to the open-source agents available, our work shows modest cost ($0.65 per issue) in resolving an average GitHub issue in SWE-Bench lite. The production of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better "signal" to be given to the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with confidence. SpecRover also seeks to demonstrate the continued importance of specification inference in automated program repair, even as program repair technologies enter the LLM era.

 Abstract:  The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) underscores the importance of Deep Learning (DL) technologies that rely on foundational DL libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Despite their robust features, these libraries face challenges with scalability and adaptation to rapid advancements in the LLM community. In response, tech giants like Apple and Huawei are developing their own DL libraries to enhance performance, increase scalability, and safeguard intellectual property. Ensuring the security of these libraries is crucial, with fuzzing being a vital solution. However, existing fuzzing frameworks struggle with target flexibility, effectively testing bug-prone API sequences, and leveraging the limited available information in new libraries. To address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, the first universal DL library fuzzing framework tailored for newly introduced and prospective DL libraries. FUTURE leverages historical bug information from existing libraries and fine-tunes LLMs for specialized code generation. This strategy helps identify vulnerabilities in new libraries and uses insights from these libraries to enhance security in existing ones, creating a cycle from history to future and back. To evaluate FUTURE's effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on three newly introduced DL libraries. Results demonstrate that FUTURE significantly outperforms existing fuzzers in bug detection, success rate of bug reproduction, validity rate of code generation, and API coverage. Notably, FUTURE has detected 148 bugs across 452 targeted APIs, including 142 previously unknown bugs. Among these, 10 have been assigned CVE IDs. Additionally, FUTURE detects 7 bugs in PyTorch, demonstrating its ability to enhance security in existing libraries in reverse.

 Abstract:  Generative AI (genAI) tools, such as ChatGPT or Copilot, are advertised to improve developer productivity and are being integrated into software development. However, misaligned trust, skepticism, and usability concerns can impede the adoption of such tools. Research also indicates that AI can be exclusionary, failing to support diverse users adequately. One such aspect of diversity is cognitive diversity—variations in users’ cognitive styles—that leads to divergence in perspectives and interaction styles. When an individual’s cognitive style is unsupported, it creates barriers to technology adoption. Therefore, to understand how to effectively integrate genAI tools into software development, it is first important to model what factors affect developers’ trust and intentions to adopt genAI tools in practice? We developed a theoretical model to (1) identify factors that influence developers’ trust in genAI tools and (2) examine the relationship between developers’ trust, cognitive styles, and their intentions to use these tools. We surveyed software developers (N=238) at two major global tech organizations and employed Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate our model. Our findings reveal that genAI’s system/output quality, functional value, and goal maintenance significantly influence developers’ trust in these tools. Furthermore, developers’ trust and cognitive styles influence their intentions to use these tools. We offer practical suggestions for designing genAI tools for effective use and inclusive user experience.  
  
  " " Hao Zhong, ""Understanding Compiler Bugs in Real Development""  
 Abstract:  Compilers are critical in development, but compiler bugs can cause hidden and serious bugs in their compiled code. To deepen the understanding of compiler bugs, in the prior empirical studies, researchers read the bug reports and patches of compilers, and analyze their causes, locations, and patterns. Although they derive many interesting findings, their studies are limited. First, as bug reports seldom explain which projects encounter compiler bugs, it is infeasible to understand the outreaching impact. Second, before compiler bugs are fixed, programmers can bypass such bugs. The bug reports of compilers do not introduce such workarounds. Finally, the distribution of compiler bugs can be distorted, since researchers and compiler developers also file bug reports. In this paper, we propose a novel angle to analyze compiler bugs. Instead of compiler bug reports, we collect compiler bugs that are mentioned in real development. When programmers encounter compiler bugs in real development, they can leave traces in their commit messages. By searching such messages, we collected 644 unique commits whose messages explicitly mention the urls of compiler bugs. From this angle, in this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to analyze compiler bugs in the wild. We summarize our results into seven useful findings for users, compiler developers, and researchers. For example, for researchers, we find that some large workarounds of compiler bugs involve repetitive and systematic changes, which indicates a new research opportunity for code migration tools. Furthermore, we attempt to apply our findings in real development, and we obtain positive feedback.

 Abstract:  Several techniques have been proposed to (partially) automate code review. Early support consisted in recommending the most suited reviewer for a given change or in prioritizing the review tasks. With the advent of deep learning in software engineering, the level of automation has been pushed to new heights, with approaches able to provide feedback on source code in natural language as a human reviewer would do. Also, recent work documented open source projects adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-reviewers. Although the research in this field is very active, little is known about the actual impact of including automatically generated code reviews in the code review process. While there are many aspects worth investigating (e.g., is knowledge transfer between developers affected?), in this work we focus on three of them: (i) review quality, i.e., the reviewer's ability to identify issues in the code; (ii) review cost, i.e., the time spent reviewing the code; and (iii) reviewer’s confidence, i.e., how confident is the reviewer about the provided feedback. We run a controlled experiment with 29 professional developers who reviewed different programs with/without the support of an automatically generated code review. During the experiment we monitored the reviewers’ activities, for over 50 hours of recorded code reviews. We show that reviewers consider valid most of the issues automatically identified by the LLM and that the availability of an automated review as a starting point strongly influences their behavior: Reviewers tend to focus on the code locations indicated by the LLM rather than searching for additional issues in other parts of the code. The reviewers who started from an automated review identified a higher number of low-severity issues while, however, not identifying more high- severity issues as compared to a completely manual process. Finally, the automated support did not result in saved time and did not increase the reviewers’ confidence.

 Abstract:  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, leading to widespread adoption of AI coding tools by developers. However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production. This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code. To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for ""striking similarity"" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code. Based on this standard, we propose an evaluation benchmark LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs. Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations. Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks. Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users.

 Abstract:  UI automation is a useful technique for UI testing, bug reproduction and robotic process automation. Recording the user actions with an application assists rapid development of UI automation scripts, but existing recording techniques are intrusive, rely on OS or GUI framework accessibility support or assume specific app implementations. Reversing-engineering user actions from screencasts is non-intrusive, but a key reverse-engineering step is currently missing - recognize human-understandable structured user actions ([command] [widget][location]) from action screencasts. To fill the gap, we propose a deep learning-based computer vision model which can recognize 11 commands and 11 widgets, and generate location phrases from action screencasts, through joint learning and multi-task learning. We label a large dataset with 7260 video-action pairs, which record the user interactions with Word, Zoom, Firefox, Photoshop, and Window 10 Settings. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the effectiveness and generality of our model, and demonstrate the usefulness of a screencast-to-action-script tool built upon our model for bug reproduction.

 Abstract:  Log parsing is a critical step that transforms unstructured log data into structured formats, facilitating subsequent log-based analysis. Traditional syntax-based log parsers are efficient and effective, but they often experience decreased accuracy when processing logs that deviate from the predefined rules. Recently, large language models (LLM) based log parsers have shown superior parsing accuracy. However, existing LLM-based parsers face three main challenges: 1) time-consuming and labor-intensive manual labeling for fine-tuning or in-context learning, 2) increased parsing costs due to the vast volume of log data and limited context size of LLMs, and 3) privacy risks from using commercial models like ChatGPT with sensitive log information. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces LibreLog, an unsupervised log parsing approach that leverages open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama3-8B) to enhance privacy and reduce operational costs while achieving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy. LibreLog first groups logs with similar static text but varying dynamic variables using a fixed-depth grouping tree. It then parses logs within these groups using three components: i) similarity scoring-based retrieval augmented generation: selects diverse logs within each group based on Jaccard similarity, helping the LLM distinguish between static text and dynamic variables; ii) self-reflection: iteratively query LLMs to refine log templates to improve parsing accuracy; and iii) log template memory: stores parsed templates to reduce LLM queries for improved parsing efficiency. Our evaluation on LogHub-2.0 shows that LibreLog achieves 25% higher parsing accuracy and processes logs 2.7 times faster compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based parsers. In short, LibreLog addresses privacy and cost concerns of using commercial LLMs while achieving state-of- the-arts parsing efficiency and accuracy.

 Abstract:  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an emerging paradigm within the blockchain space that aims to revolutionize conventional financial systems through the application of blockchain technology. The substantial value of digital assets managed by DeFi protocols makes it a lucrative target for attacks. Despite the human resources and the application of automated tools, frequent attacks still cause significant fund losses to DeFi participants. Existing tools primarily rely on oracles similar to those used in traditional software analysis, making it challenging for them to detect functional bugs specific to the DeFi domain. Since blockchain functions as a distributed ledger system, the foundation of any DeFi protocol is the accurate maintenance of key state variables representing user funds. If these variables are not properly updated or designed to reflect the intended flow of funds, attackers can exploit these flaws to steal assets. From the study of popular DeFi protocols, we observe that, in DeFi systems, to ensure a transaction does not misappropriate someone's fund, the direction of changes (increase or decrease) of values associated with the amount of asset or debt of a user has to adhere to some fairness properties. We propose a concept called fairness bug which allows attackers to gain profit without cost. We propose an inter-procedural and inter-contract static analysis technique that utilizes symbolic execution and an SMT solver to automatically detect fairness bugs in DeFi smart contracts. We have implemented our fairness-checking approach in our tool, named FairChecker. We evaluate our tool on a benchmark of 113 real-world DeFi protocols with 34 fairness bugs. The results show that our tool can detect 32 bugs with a recall of 94.1\% and a precision of 46.4\%, demonstrating its effectiveness.  
  
  " Li Huang, Weifeng Sun, Meng Yan, "Iterative Generation of Adversarial Example for Deep Code Models"  
 Abstract:  Deep code models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, making it possible for semantically identical inputs to trigger different responses. Current black-box attack methods typically prioritize the impact of identifiers on the model based on custom importance scores or program context and incrementally replace identifiers to generate adversarial examples. However, these methods often fail to fully leverage feedback from failed attacks to guide subsequent attacks, resulting in problems such as local optima bias and efficiency dilemmas. In this paper, we introduce ITGen, a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that iteratively utilizes feedback from failed attacks to refine the generation process. It employs a bitvector-based representation of code variants to mitigate local optima bias. By integrating these bit vectors with feedback from failed attacks, ITGen uses an enhanced Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently predict the most promising code variants, significantly reducing the search space and thus addressing the efficiency dilemma. We conducted experiments on a total of nine deep code models for both understanding and generation tasks, demonstrating ITGen's effectiveness and efficiency, as well as its ability to enhance model robustness through adversarial fine-tuning. For example, on average, ITGen improves the attack success rate by 47.98% and 69.70% over the state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., ALERT and BeamAttack), respectively.

 Abstract:  Java offers the Java Native Interface (JNI), which allows programs running in the Java Virtual Machine to invoke and be manipulated by native applications and libraries written in other languages, typically C. While JNI mechanism significantly enhances the Java platform's capabilities, it also presents challenges for static analysis of Java programs due to the complex behaviors introduced by native code. Therefore, effectively resolving the interactions between Java and native code is crucial for static analysis. In this paper, we introduce JNIFER, the first interactive cross-language pointer analysis for resolving native code in Java programs. JNIFER integrates both Java and C pointer analyses, equipped with advanced native call and JNI function analyses, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both Java and native code. During the analysis of cross-language interactions, the two analyzers interact with each other, constructing cross-language points-to relations and call graphs, thereby approximating the runtime behavior at the interaction sites. Our evaluation shows that JNIFER outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of soundness while maintaining high precision and comparable efficiency, as evidenced by extensive experiments on OpenJDK and real-world Java applications.

 Abstract:  Accurately diagnosing the fault that causes the failure is crucial for maintaining the reliability of a microservice system after a failure occurs. Mainstream fault diagnosis approaches are data-driven and mainly rely on three modalities of runtime data: traces, logs, and metrics. Diagnosing faults with multiple modalities of data in microservice systems has been an clear trend in recent years because different types of faults and corresponding failures tend to manifest in data of various modalities. Accurately diagnosing faults by fully leveraging multiple modalities of data is confronted with two challenges: 1)how to minimize information loss when extracting features for data of each modality; 2)how to correctly capture andutilize the relationships among data of different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose FAMOS, a Fault diagnosis Approach for MicrOservice Systems through effective multi-modal data fusion. On the one hand, FAMOS employs independent feature extractors to preserve the intrinc features for each modality. On the other hand, FAMOS introduces a new Gaussian-attention mechanism to accurately correlate data of different modalities and then captures the inter-modality relationship with a cross-attention mechanism. We evaluated FAMOS on two datasets constructed by injecting comprehensive and abundant faults into an open-source microservice system and a real-world industrial microservice system. Experimental results demonstrate the FAMOS’s effectiveness in fault diagnosis, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with an increase of 20.33%.

 Abstract:  Software-intensive systems often produce console logs for troubleshooting purpose. Log parsing, which aims at parsing a log message into a specific log template, typically serves as the first step toward automated log analytics. To better comprehend semantic information of log messages, many semantic-based log parsers have been proposed. These log parsers fine-tune a small pretrained language model (PLM) such as RoBERTa on a few labelled log samples. With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs), some recent studies also propose to leverage LLMs such as ChatGPT through in-context learning for automated log parsing, and obtain better results than previous semantic-based log parsers with small PLMs. In this paper, we show that semantic-based log parsers with small PLMs can actually achieve better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art LLM-based log parsing models while being more efficient and cost-effective. We propose UNLEASH, a novel semantic-based log parsing approach, which incorporates three enhancement methods to boost the performance of PLMs for log parsing, including (1) an entropy-based ranking method to select the most informative log samples; (2) a contrastive learning method to enhance the fine-tuning process; and (3) an inference optimization method to improve the log parsing performance. We evaluate UNLEASH on a set of large log datasets and the experimental results show that UNLEASH is effective and efficient, when compared to state-of-the-art log parsers.

 Abstract:  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a promising cryptographic primitive that enables secure computation over encrypted data. A primary use of FHE is to support privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) on public cloud infrastructures. Despite the rapid development of FHE-based ML (or HE-ML) in recent years, the community still lacks a systematic understanding of their robustness. In this paper, we aim to systematically test and understand the deviation behaviors of HE-ML models, where the same input causes deviant outputs between FHE-hardened models and their plaintext versions, leading to completely incorrect model predictions. To effectively uncover deviation-triggering inputs under the constraints of expensive FHE computation, we design a novel differential testing tool called HEDiff, which leverages the margin metric on the plaintext model as guidance to drive targeted testing on FHE models. For the identified deviation inputs, we further analyze them to determine whether they exhibit general noise patterns that are transferable. We evaluate HEDiff using three popular HE-ML frameworks, covering 12 different combinations of models and datasets. HEDiff successfully detected hundreds of deviation inputs across almost every tested FHE framework and model. We also quantitatively show that the identified deviation inputs are (visually) meaningful in comparison to regular inputs. Further schematic analysis reveals the root cause of these deviant inputs and allows us to generalize their noise patterns for more directed testing.

 Abstract:  Highly configurable software systems are crucial in practice to satisfy the rising demand for software customization, and combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is an important methodology for testing such systems. Constrained covering array generation (CCAG), as the core problem in CIT, is to construct a t-wise covering array (CA) of minimum size, where t represents the testing strength. Extensive studies have demonstrated that high-strength CIT (e.g., 4-wise and 5-wise CIT) has stronger fault detection capability than low-strength CIT (i.e., 2-wise and 3-wise CIT), and there exist certain critical faults that can be disclosed through high-strength CIT. Although existing CCAG algorithm has exhibited effectiveness in solving the low-strength CCAG problem, they suffer the severe high-strength challenge when solving 4-wise and 5-wise CCAG, which urgently calls for effective solutions to solving 4-wise and 5-wise CCAG problems. To alleviate the high-strength challenge, we propose a novel and effective local search algorithm dubbed HSCA. Particularly, HSCA incorporates three new and powerful techniques, i.e., multi-round CA generation mechanism, dynamic priority assigning technique, and variable grouping strategy, to improve its performance. Extensive experiments on 35 real-world and synthetic instances demonstrate that HSCA can generate significantly smaller 4-wise and 5-wise CAs than existing state-of-the-art CCAG algorithms.

 Abstract:  Distinct from traditional malicious packages, this paper uncovers a novel attack vector named “blackhat Search Engine Optimization through REPositories (RepSEO)”. In this approach, attackers carefully craft packages to manipulate search engine results, exploiting the credibility of software repositories to promote illicit websites. Our research presents a systematic analysis of the underground ecosystem of RepSEO, identifying key players such as account providers, advertisers, and publishers. We developed an effective detection tool, applied to a ten-year large-scale dataset of npm, Docker Hub, and NuGet software repositories. This investigation led to the startling discovery of 3,801,682 abusive packages, highlighting the widespread nature of this attack. Our study also delves into the supply chain tactics of these attacks, revealing strategies like the use of self-hosted email services for account registration, redirection methods to obscure landing pages, and rapid deployment techniques by aggressive attackers. Additionally, we explore the profit motives behind these attacks, identifying two primary types of advertisers: survey-based advertisers and malware distribution advertisers. We reported npm, NuGet, and Docker Hub about the RepSEO packages and the related supply chain vulnerabilities of Google, and received their acknowledgments. Software repositories have started removing the abusive packages as of this paper’s submission. We also open-source our code and data to facilitate future research.

 Abstract:  Deep Learning (DL) systems have been widely adopted across various industrial domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent healthcare. As with traditional software, DL systems also need to constantly evolve to meet ever-changing user requirements. However, ensuring the quality of these continuously evolving systems presents significant challenges, especially in the context of testing. Understanding how industry developers address these challenges and what extra obstacles they are facing could provide valuable insights for further safeguarding the quality of DL systems. To reach this goal, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 DL developers from diverse domains and backgrounds. More specifically, our study focuses on exploring the challenges developers encounter in testing evolving DL systems, the practical solutions they employ, and their expectations for extra support. Our results highlight the difficulties in testing evolving DL systems and identify the best practices for DL developers to address them. Additionally, we pinpoint potential future research directions to enhance testing effectiveness in evolving DL systems.

 Abstract:  Enhancing the modular structure of existing systems has attracted substantial research interest, focusing on two main methods: (1) software modularization and (2) identifying design issues (e.g., smells) as refactoring opportunities. However, re-modularization solutions often require extensive modifications to the original modules, and the design issues identified are generally too coarse to guide refactoring strategies. Combining the above two methods, this paper introduces a novel concept, \emph{PairSmell}, which exploits modularization to pinpoint design issues necessitating refactoring. We concentrate on a granular but fundamental aspect of modularity principles---\emph{modular relation (MR)}, i.e., \emph{whether a pair of entities are separated or collocated}. The main assumption is that, if the actual MR of a pair violates its `apt MR', i.e., an MR agreed on by multiple modularization tools (as raters), it can be deemed likely a flawed architectural decision that necessitates further examination. To quantify and evaluate \emph{PairSmell}, we conduct an empirical study on 20 C/C++ and Java projects, using 4 established modularization tools to identify two forms of \emph{PairSmell}: inapt separated pairs $\mathit{InSep}$ and inapt collocated pairs $\mathit{InCol}$. Our study on 260,003 instances reveals that their architectural impacts are substantial: (1) on average, 14.60\% and 20.44\% of software entities are involved in $\mathit{InSep}$ and $\mathit{InCol}$ MRs respectively; (2) $\mathit{InSep}$ pairs are associated with 190\% more co-changes than properly separated pairs, while $\mathit{InCol}$ pairs are associated with 35\% fewer co-changes than properly collocated pairs, both indicating a successful identification of modular structures detrimental to software quality; and (3) both forms of \emph{PairSmell} persist across software evolution. This evidence strongly suggests that \emph{PairSmell} can provide meaningful insights for inspecting modular structure, with the identified issues being both granular and fundamental, making the enhancement of modular design more efficient.

 Abstract:  Maintaining software design quality is crucial for the long-term maintainability and evolution of systems. However, design issues such as poor modularity and excessive complexity often emerge as codebases grow. Developers rely on external tools, such as program analysis techniques, to identify such issues. This work investigates an automated approach for analyzing and localizing design issues using Large Language Models (LLMs). Large language models have demonstrated significant performance on coding tasks, but directly leveraging them for design issue localization is challenging. Large codebases exceed typical LLM context windows, and program analysis tool outputs in non-textual modalities (e.g., graphs or interactive visualizations) are incompatible with LLMs’ natural language inputs. To address these challenges, we propose LOCALIZEAGENT, a novel multi-agent framework for effective design issue localization. LOCALIZEAGENT integrates specialized agents that (1) analyze code to identify potential code design issues, (2) transform program analysis outputs into abstraction-aware LLM-friendly natural language summaries, (3) generate context-aware prompts tailored to specific refactoring types, and (4) leverage LLMs to locate and rank the localized issues based on their relevance. Our evaluation using diverse real-world codebases demonstrates significant improvements over baseline approaches, with LOCALIZEAGENT achieving 138%, 166%, and 206% relative improvements in exact match accuracy for localizing information hiding, complexity, and modularity issues, respectively.

 Abstract:  The shift-left principle in the industry requires us to test a software application as early as possible. Particularly, when code changes in a microservice application are committed to the code repository we have to efficiently identify all public microservice interfaces impacted by the changes such that the impacted interfaces can be tested as soon as possible. However, developing an efficient change impact analysis is extremely challenging in microservices because of the multilingual problem: microservice applications are often implemented using varying programming languages and involve diverse frameworks and configuration files. To address this issue this paper presents Microscope, a language-agnostic change impact analysis that uniformly represents the code, configuration files, frameworks, and code changes by relational Datalog rules. Microscope then benefits from an efficient Datalog solver to identify impacted interfaces. Experiments based on the use of Microscope in a leading software company demonstrate that Microscope is both effective and fast as it successfully identifies interfaces impacted by 112 code commits, with moderate time overhead, and could reduce 97% of interfaces to test and save 73% of testing time after code changes.

 Abstract:  Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, allows for high-quality software. However, the verification process is expensive, requiring significant expertise and manual effort to write proofs. Recent work has explored automating proof synthesis using machine learning, and even more recently, large language models (LLMs), showing that retrieving relevant premises (such as lemmas and definitions) is helpful for these models. We present Rango, a fully automated proof synthesis tool for Coq that uses, not only relevant premises but also similar proofs from the current project. Rango uses retrieval augmentation at every step of the proof to automatically determine which proofs and premises to include in the context of its fine-tuned LLM. In this way, Rango adapts to the project _and_ to the evolving state of the proof. We create a new dataset, CoqStoq, of 2,205 open-source Coq projects from GitHub, which includes both training data and a curated evaluation benchmark of well-maintained projects. On this benchmark, Rango synthesizes 27.7% of the proofs, which is 10% more proofs than prior state-of-the-art tool Tactician. Our evaluation also shows that adding relevant proofs to the context in Rango leads to a 45% increase in the number of theorems proven.

 Abstract:  Recent research has studied the importance and identified causes of nondeterminism in software. Static analysis tools exhibit many risk factors for nondeterministic behavior, but no work has analyzed the occurrence of such behavior in these tools. To bridge this gap, we perform an extensive empirical study aiming to understand past and ongoing nondeterminism in 12 popular, open-source static analysis tools that target 5 types of projects. We first conduct a qualitative study to understand the extent to which nondeterministic behavior has been found and addressed within the tools under study, and find results in 7 tool repositories. After classifying the issues and commits by root cause, we find that the majority of nondeterminisms are caused by concurrency issues, incorrect analysis logic, or assumed orderings of unordered data structures, which have shared patterns. We also perform a quantitative analysis, where we use two strategies and diverse input programs and configurations to detect yet-unknown nondeterministic behaviors. We discover such behavior in 8 out of the 12 tools, including 3 which had no results from the qualitative analysis. We find that nondeterminism often appears in multiple configurations on a variety of input programs. We communicated all identified nondeterminism to the developers and received confirmation of five tools. Finally, we detail a case study of fixing FlowDroid's nondeterministic behavior.  
  
  " Xintong Zhou, Zhenyang Xu, Mengxiao Zhang, Yongqiang Tian, "Chengnian Sun, ""WDD: Weighted Delta Debugging""  
 Abstract:  Delta Debugging is a widely used family of algorithms (e.g., ddmin and ProbDD) to automatically minimize bug-triggering test inputs, thus to facilitate debugging. It takes a list of elements with each element representing a fragment of the test input, systematically partitions the list at different granularities, identifies and deletes bug-irrelevant partitions. Prior delta debugging algorithms assume there are no differences among the elements in the list, and thus treat them uniformly during partitioning. However, in practice, this assumption usually does not hold, because the size (referred to as weight) of the fragment represented by each element can vary significantly. For example, a single element representing 50% of the test input is much more likely to be bug-relevant than elements representing only 1%. This assumption inevitably impairs the efficiency or even effectiveness of these delta debugging algorithms. This paper proposes Weighted Delta Debugging (WDD), a novel concept to help prior delta debugging algorithms overcome the limitation mentioned above. The key insight of WDD is to assign each element in the list a weight according to its size, and distinguish different elements based on their weights during partitioning. We designed two new minimization algorithms Wddmin and WProbDD, by applying WDD to ddmin and ProbDD respectively. We extensively evaluated Wddmin and WProbDD in two representative applications, HDD and Perses, on 62 benchmarks across two languages. On average, with Wddmin, HDD and Perses took 51.31% and 7.47% less time to generate 9.12% and 0.96% smaller results than with ddmin, respectively. With WProbDD, HDD and Perses used 11.98% and 9.72% less time to generate 13.40% and 2.20% smaller results than with ProbDD, respectively. The results strongly demonstrate the value of WDD. We firmly believe that WDD opens up a new dimension to improve test input minimization techniques.  
  
  " Faridah Akinotcho, Lili Wei, Julia Rubin, "Mobile Application Coverage: The 30% Curse and Ways Forward"  
 Abstract:  Testing, security analysis, and other dynamic quality assurance approaches rely on mechanisms that invoke software under test, aiming to achieve high code coverage. A large number of invocation mechanisms proposed in the literature, in particular for Android mobile applications, employ GUI-driven application exploration. However, studies show that even the most advanced GUI exploration techniques can cover only around 30% of a real- world application. This paper aims to investigate “the remaining 70%”. By conducting a large-scale experiment involving two human experts, who thoroughly explored 61 benchmark and 42 popular apps from Google Play, we show that achieving a substantially larger coverage for real-world applications is impractical even if we factor out known GUI-based exploration issues, such as the inability to provide semantic inputs and the right order of events. The main reasons preventing humans from covering the entire application include application dependencies on device configurations and external resources. Thus, future investment into GUI-based exploration strategies is unlikely to lead to substantial improvements in coverage. To chart possible ways forward and explore approaches to satisfy/bypass these dependencies, we thoroughly analyze code-level properties guarding them. Our analysis shows that a large fraction of the dependencies could actually be successfully bypassed with relatively simple beyond- GUI exploration techniques. We hope our study can inspire future work in this area and also provide a realistic benchmark for evaluating this work.

 Abstract:  The Open Network (TON), designed to support Telegram's extensive user base of hundreds of millions, has garnered considerable attention since its launch in 2022. \textit{FunC} is the most popular programming language for writing smart contracts on TON. It is distinguished by a unique syntax compared to other smart contract languages. Despite growing interest, research on the practical defects of TON smart contracts is still in its early stages. In this paper, we summarize eight smart contract defects identified from TON's official blogs and audit reports, each with detailed definitions and code examples. Furthermore, we propose a static analysis framework called TONScanner to facilitate the detection of these defects. Specifically, TONScanner reuses \textit{FunC} compiler's frontend code to transform the \textit{FunC} contract code into \textit{FunC} intermediate representation (IR) in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on this IR, TONScanner constructs a control flow graph (CFG), then transforms it into a static single assignment (SSA) form to simplify further analysis. TONScanner also integrates Data Dependency, Call Graph, Taint Analysis, and Cell Construct, which are specifically tailored for TON blockchain's unique data structures. These components finally facilitate the identification of the eight defects. We evaluate the effectiveness of TONScanner by applying it to 1,640 smart contracts and find a total of 14,995 defects. Through random sampling and manual labeling, we find that TONScanner achieves an overall precision of 97.49%. The results reveal that current TON contracts contain numerous defects, indicating that developers are prone to making errors. TONScanner has proven its ability to accurately identify these defects, thereby aiding in their correction.

 Abstract:  Runtime verification (RV) found hundreds of bugs by monitoring passing tests against formal specifications (specs). RV first instruments a program to obtain relevant events, e.g., method calls, to monitor. A hindrance to RV adoption, especially in continuous integration, is its high overhead. So, prior work proposed spec-driven evolution-aware techniques to speed up RV. They use complex analysis to re-monitor a subset of specs related to code impacted by changes. But, these techniques assume that RV overhead is dominated by monitoring time, and their designs often sacrifice safety (ability to find all new violations) for speed. We present iMOP, the first instrumentation-driven evolution-aware RV framework. iMOP leverages a recent observation that RV overhead during testing is often dominated by instrumentation, not monitoring. iMOP embodies a family of 14 techniques that aim to safely speed up RV by simply re-instrumenting only changed code. Instrumentation from the old revision is re-used for unchanged code, and all specs are re-monitored in the new revision. We implement iMOP as a Maven plugin and evaluate it on 1,627 revisions of 48 projects, using 160 specs of correct JDK API usage. iMOP is safe by design. It is up to 29.6x faster than re-running RV from scratch after each change, and 17.8x and 6.7x faster than safe and unsafe spec-driven techniques, respectively. iMOP is faster than just applying regression test selection to RV.

 Abstract:  Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) have been found to exhibit outstanding performance in the software engineering domain, especially the remarkable performance in coding tasks. However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the effectiveness of all state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code models across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs. Results demonstrate that A-GRACE notably enhances generalization while maintaining similar levels of effectiveness and specificity compared to the vanilla GRACE.

 Abstract:  Over the past decade, the application of deep learning in code clone detection has produced remarkable results. However, the current approaches have two limitations: (a) code representation approaches with low information utilization, such as vanilla Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), leading to information redundancy which results in performance degradation; (b) low efficiency of clone detection on evaluation, resulting in excessive time costs during practical use. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Representation Transformer with Optimized Abstract Syntax Tree (MRT-OAST) to introduce an efficient code representation method while achieving competitive performance. Specifically, MRT-OAST strategically prunes and enhances the AST, utilizing both pre-order and post-order traversals to represent two different representations. To speed up the evaluation process, MRT-OAST utilizes a pure Siamese network and employs cosine similarity to compare the similarity between codes. Our approach effectively reduces AST sequences to 40% and 39% of their original length in Java and C/C++ while preserving structural information. In code clone detection tasks, our model surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on OJClone and Google Code Jam. During the evaluation of BigCloneBench, our model has a 5x speed improvement compared to the state-of-the-art lightweight model and a 563x speed improvement compared to the BERT-based model, with only a 0.3% and 0.9% decrease in $F_1$-score.

 Abstract:  Code snippet adaptation is a fundamental activity in the software development process. Unlike code generation, code snippet adaptation is not a ``free creation'', which requires developers to tailor a given code snippet in order to fit specific requirements and the code context. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have confirmed their effectiveness in the code generation task with promising results. However, their performance on code snippet adaptation, a reuse-oriented and context-dependent code change prediction task, is still unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance and issues of LLMs on the adaptation task. We first evaluate the adaptation performances of three popular LLMs and compare them to the code generation task. Our result indicates that their adaptation ability is weaker than generation, with a nearly 15\% decrease on pass@1 and more context-related errors. By manually inspecting 200 cases, we further investigate the causes of LLMs’ sub-optimal performance, which can be classified into three categories, \emph{i.e.,} \textit{Unclear Requirement}, \textit{Requirement Misalignment} and \textit{Context Misapplication}. Based on the above empirical research, we propose an interactive prompting approach to eliciting LLMs' ability on the adaptation task. Specifically, we enhance the prompt by enriching the context and decomposing the task, which alleviates context misapplication and improves requirement understanding. Besides, we enable LLMs' reflection by requiring them to interact with a human or a LLM counselor, compensating for unclear requirement. Our experimental result reveals that our approach greatly improve LLMs' adaptation performance. The best-performing Human-LLM interaction successfully solves 159 out of the 202 identified defects and improves the pass@1 and pass@5 by over 40\% compared to the initial instruction-based prompt. Considering human efforts, we suggest multi-agent interaction as a trade-off, which can achieve comparable performance with excellent generalization ability. We deem that our approach could provide methodological assistance for autonomous code snippet reuse and adaptation with LLMs.

 Abstract:  Energy consumption in software systems is becoming increasingly important, especially in large-scale deployments. However, debugging energy-related issues remains challenging due to the lack of specialized tools. This paper presents an energy debugging methodology for identifying and isolating energy consumption hotspots in software systems. We demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness through a case study of Redis, a popular in-memory database. Our analysis reveals significant energy consumption differences between Alpine and Ubuntu distributions, with Alpine consuming up to 20.2% more power in certain operations. We trace this difference to the implementation of the `memcpy` function in different C standard libraries (musl vs. glibc). By isolating and benchmarking `memcpy`, we confirm it as the primary cause of the energy discrepancy. Our findings highlight the importance of considering energy efficiency in software dependencies and demonstrate the capability to assist developers in identifying and addressing energy-related issues. This work contributes to the growing field of sustainable software engineering by providing a systematic approach to energy debugging.  
  
  Cedric Richter, Marek Chalupa, Marie-Christine Jakobs, "Heike Wehrheim, ""Cooperative Software Verification via Dynamic Program Splitting""  
 Abstract:  Cooperative software verification divides the task of software verification among several verification tools in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness. The basic approach is to let verifiers work on different parts of a program and at the end join verification results. While this idea is intuitively appealing, cooperative verification is usually hindered by the facts that program decomposition (1) is often static, disregarding strengths and weaknesses of employed verifiers, and (2) often represents the decomposed program parts in a specific proprietary format, thereby making the use of off-the-shelf verifiers in cooperative verification difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative verification scheme that we call dynamic program splitting (DPS). Splitting decomposes programs into (smaller) programs, and thus directly enables the use of off-the-shelf tools. In DPS, splitting is dynamically applied on demand: Verification starts by giving a verification task (a program plus a correctness specification) to a verifier V1. Whenever V1 finds the current task to be hard to verify, it splits the task (i.e., the program) and restarts verification on subtasks. DPS continues until (1) a violation is found, (2) all subtasks are completed or (3) some user-defined stopping criterion is met. In the latter case, the remaining uncompleted subtasks are merged into a single one and given to a next verifier V2, repeating the same procedure on the still unverified program parts. This way, the decomposition is steered by what is hard to verify for particular verifiers, leveraging their complementary strengths. We have implemented dynamic program splitting and evaluated it on benchmarks of the annual software verification competition SV-COMP. The evaluation shows that cooperative verification with DPS is able to solve verification tasks that none of the constituent verifiers can solve, without any significant overhead.

 Abstract:  The heterogeneous nature of contemporary software, comprising components like closed-source libraries, embedded assembly snippets, and modules written in multiple programming languages, leads to significant verification challenges. Currently, There are no mature and available methods to effectively address such problems. To bridge this gap, we propose a verification approach capable of effectively verifying heterogeneous programs. This approach is universally applicable. It theoretically supports the verification of any heterogeneous program that can be compiled into binary code, without being constrained by any specific programming language. The approach begins by compiling the entire program or its unverifiable segments into binary format. Under guarantees of semantic equivalence, these binaries are converted into verifiable C code, which can then be verified using existing C verification tools. Based on the RISC-V architecture, we developed the Hetrify tool to implement this verification approach. The tool is supported by rigorous mathematical proofs to ensure operational semantic equivalence between the converted C programs and their original counterparts. To validate our approach, we conducted verification experiments on 130 programs, including 100 assembly programs and 30 large heterogeneous programs with missing critical function source code, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

 Abstract:  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code generation recently, offering programmers revolutionary assistance in software development. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are susceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is produced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned on it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. This generation process differs from the common practice in human coding, which involves review and adjustment during the coding process according to quality and requirements. Existing LLM-based approaches that typically consider post-revising after code generation fail to resolve errors in time, leading to the challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of resources. Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error immediately during code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait for post-revising after generation. In this paper, we propose \ourapproachbf, which integrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code generation. Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental error detection during the generation process. When an error is detected, the backtracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and constraint regeneration, thereby avoiding the recurrence of the same error. Experiments on multiple code generation benchmarks show that \ourapproachbf can significantly reduce the errors generated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of over 98.9\%. The test pass rate is improved by up to 23.8\% compared to the best baseline approach. Compared to the post-revising baseline, the cost is reduced by 19.3\%. Moreover, our approach is model-agnostic and achieves consistent improvements across six LLMs.

 Abstract:  Modeling structure and behavior of software systems plays a crucial role in the industrial practice of software engineering. As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completions is still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach, \textsc{RaMc}, leveraging large language models, model histories of software systems, and retrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments on three datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-source community dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated model repositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for model completion. We found that large language models are indeed a promising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30% semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19% type-correct completions). Furthermroe, we found that the general inference capabilities of large language models are useful, for example, when dealing with concepts for which there are few, noisy, or no examples at all.

 Abstract:  In recent years, the development of Solidity smart contracts has been increasing rapidly in popularity. Code cloning is a common coding practice, and many prior studies have revealed that code clones could negatively impact software maintenance and quality. However, there is little work systematically analyzing the nature and impacts of code clones in solidity smart contracts. To bridge this gap, we investigate the prevalence evolution, and bug-proneness of code clones in solidity smart contracts, and further identify the possible reasons for these clones’ occurrences. With our evaluation of 26,294 smart contracts with 97,877 functions, we have found that code clones are highly prevalent in smart contracts. Additionally, on average, 32.01% of clones co-evolve, indicating the need for careful management to avoid consistency issues. Surprisingly, unlike in traditional software development, code clones in smart contracts are rarely involved in bug fixes. Finally, we identify three main factors that affect the occurrences of clones. We believe our study can provide valuable insights for developers to understand and manage code clones in solidity smart contracts.

 Abstract:  The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has made their failures increasingly evident. Testing efforts aimed at identifying the inputs leading to those failures are challenged by the input's long-tail distribution, whose area under the curve is dominated by rare scenarios. We hypothesize that leveraging emerging open-access datasets can accelerate the exploration of long-tail inputs. Having access to diverse inputs, however, is not sufficient to expose failures; an effective test also requires an oracle to distinguish between correct and incorrect behaviors. Current datasets lack such oracles and developing them is notoriously difficult. In response, we propose DiffTest4AV, a differential testing framework designed to address the unique challenges of testing AV systems: 1) for any given input, many outputs may be considered acceptable, 2) the long-tail contains an insurmountable number of inputs to explore, and 3) the AV's continuous execution loop requires for failures to persist in order to affect the system. DiffTest4AV integrates statistical analysis to identify meaningful behavioral variations, judges their importance in terms of the severity of these differences, and incorporates sequential analysis to detect persistent errors indicative of potential system-level failures. Our study on 5 versions of the commercially-available, road-deployed comma.ai OpenPilot system, using 3 available image datasets, demonstrates the capabilities of the framework to detect high-severity, high-confidence, long-running test failures.

 Abstract:  The integrity of software builds is fundamental to the security of the software supply chain. While Thompson first raised the potential for attacks on build infrastructure in 1984, limited attention has been given to build integrity in the past 40 years, enabling recent attacks on SolarWinds, event-stream, and xz. The best-known defense against build system attacks is creating \emph{reproducible builds}; however, achieving them can be complex for both technical and social reasons and thus is often viewed as impractical to obtain. In this paper, we analyze reproducibility of builds in a novel context: reusable \emph{components} distributed as \emph{packages} in six popular software ecosystems (npm, Maven, PyPI, Go, RubyGems, and Cargo). Our quantitative study on a representative sample of 4000 packages in each ecosystem raises concerns: Rates of reproducible builds vary widely between ecosystems, with some ecosystems having all packages reproducible whereas others have \issues in nearly every package. However, upon deeper investigation, we identified that with relatively straightforward infrastructure configuration and patching of build tools, we can achieve very high rates of reproducible builds in all studied ecosystems. We conclude that if the ecosystems adopt our suggestions, the build process of published packages can be independently confirmed for nearly all packages without individual developer actions, and doing so will prevent significant future software supply chain attacks.

 Abstract:  Existing malicious code detection techniques can aid the manual review process by predicting which packages are likely to be malicious. However, these techniques often suffer from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to assist security analysts in detecting malicious packages through the empirical study of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect malicious code in the npm ecosystem. We present SecurityAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code using ChatGPT. We leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SecurityAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious packages detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. We attained precision and F1 scores of 91% and 94% for GPT-3, and 99% & 97% for GPT-4, respectively, with GPT-3 offering a cost-effective balance. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, hidden backdoors, and suspicious domain connection categories as the top detected malicious packages. The lack of diversity in model-generated responses led to hallucinations, resulting in misclassification cases, with GPT-3 hallucinating more frequently.  
  
  Xin-Cheng Wen, Zirui Lin, Cuiyun Gao, Hongyu Zhang, Yong Wang, "Qing Liao, ""Repository-Level Graph Representation Learning for Enhanced Security Patch Detection""  
 Abstract:  Software vendors often silently release security patches without providing sufficient advisories (e.g., Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) or delayed updates via resources (e.g., National Vulnerability Database). Therefore, it has become crucial to detect these security patches to ensure secure software maintenance. However, existing methods face the following challenges: (1) They primarily focus on the information within the patches themselves, overlooking the complex dependencies in the repository. (2) Security patches typically involve multiple functions and files, increasing the difficulty in well learning the representations. To alleviate the above challenges, this paper proposes a \textit{Repo}sitory-level Security Patch Detection framework named \textit{RepoSPD}, which comprises three key components: 1) a repository-level graph construction, RepoCPG, which represents software patches by merging pre-patch and post-patch source code at the repository level; 2) a structure-aware patch representation, which fuses the graph and sequence branch and aims at comprehending the relationship among multiple code changes; 3) progressive learning, which facilitates the model in balancing semantic and structural information. To evaluate RepoSPD, we employ two widely-used datasets in security patch detection: SPI-DB and PatchDB. We further extend these datasets to the repository level, incorporating a total of 20,238 and 28,781 versions of repository in C/C++ programming languages, respectively, denoted as SPI-DB* and PatchDB*. We compare RepoSPD with six existing security patch detection methods and five static tools. Our experimental results demonstrate that RepoSPD outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, with improvements of 11.90\%, and 3.10\% in terms of accuracy on the two datasets, respectively. These results underscore the effectiveness of RepoSPD in detecting security patches. Furthermore, RepoSPD can detect 151 security patches, which outperforms the best-performing baseline by 21.36\% with respect to accuracy.

 Abstract:  Reusing pre-trained machine learning models is becoming very popular due to model hubs such as Hugging Face (HF). However, similar to when reusing software, many issues may arise when reusing an ML model. In many cases, users resort to asking questions on discussion forums such as the HF community forum. In this paper, we study how we can reduce the community's workload in answering these questions and increase the likelihood that questions receive a quick answer. We analyze 11,278 discussions from the HF model community that contain user questions about ML models. We focus on the effort spent handling questions, the high-level topics of discussions, and the potential for standardizing responses in model cards based on a model card template. Our findings indicate that there is not much effort involved in responding to user questions, however, 40.1% of the questions remain open without any response. A topic analysis shows that discussions are more centered around technical details on model development and troubleshooting, indicating that more input from model providers is required. We show that 42.5% of the questions could have been answered if the model provider followed a standard model card template for the model card. Based on our analysis, we recommend that model providers add more development-related details on the model's architecture, algorithm, data preprocessing and training code in existing documentation (sub)sections and add new (sub)sections to the template to address common questions about model usage and hardware requirements.

 Abstract:  Spreadsheets are routinely used in business and scientific contexts, and one of the most vexing challenges is performing data cleaning prior to analysis and evaluation. The ad-hoc and arbitrary nature of data cleaning problems, such as typos, inconsistent formatting, missing values, and a lack of standardization, often creates the need for highly specialized pipelines. We ask whether an LLM can find its way around a spreadsheet and how to support end-users in taking their free-form data processing requests to fruition. Just like RAG retrieves context to answer users’ queries, we demonstrate how we can retrieve elements from a code library to compose data preprocessing pipelines. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the quality of our system and how it is able to continuously augment its vocabulary by saving new codes and pipelines back to the code library for future retrieval.

 Abstract:  Execution tracing is essential for understanding system and software behaviour, yet lost trace events can significantly compromise data integrity and analysis. Existing solutions for trace reconstruction often fail to fully leverage available data, particularly in complex and high-dimensional contexts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly diffusion models, have set new benchmarks in image, audio, and natural language generation. This study conducts the first comprehensive evaluation of diffusion models for reconstructing incomplete trace event sequences. Using nine distinct datasets generated from the Phoronix Test Suite, we rigorously test these models on sequences of varying lengths and missing data ratios. Our results indicate that the SSSD$^{S4}$ model, in particular, achieves superior performance, in terms of accuracy, perfect rate, and ROUGE-L score across diverse imputation scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based models to accurately reconstruct missing events, thereby maintaining data integrity and enhancing system monitoring and analysis.

 Abstract:  Since its inception, UML, the Unified Modeling Language, has been touted as the way to go when it comes to designing and documenting software systems. While being an integral part of many university software engineering programs, UML has found little consideration among developers, especially in open source software. Reasons for this include that UML shares some shortcomings with other forms of documentation (e.g., limited availability, outdatedness, inadequate level of detail). We present a study to investigate the evolution and the current situation regarding the use of UML in open source projects. We mined and analyzed ~13k GitHub projects, developing strategies and heuristics to identify UML files through their extensions and contents, for a quantitative analysis of two decades of evolution of the usage of UML. We explored the popularity of UML, derived characteristics of projects leveraging UML, and analyzed the authors, creators and maintainers, of UML artifacts. Our study confirms that UML is indeed still under-utilized. At the same time we found evidence of a resurgence coinciding with the popularity of human-readable text-based formats, defined and used by tools like PlantUML and Mermaid. We discuss how identifying and addressing the new challenges implied by this resurgence could impact the future of UML.

 Abstract:  Website accessibility is essential for inclusiveness and regulatory compliance. Although third-party advertisements (ads) are a vital revenue source for free web services, they introduce significant accessibility challenges. Leasing a website’s space to ad-serving technologies like DoubleClick results in developers losing control over ad content accessibility. Even on highly accessible websites, third-party ads can undermine adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We conduct the first-of-its-kind large-scale investigation of 430K website elements, including nearly 100K ad elements, to understand the accessibility of ads on websites. We seek to understand the prevalence of inaccessible ads and their overall impact on the accessibility of websites. Our findings show that 67% of websites experience increased accessibility violations due to ads, with common violations including Focus Visible (WCAG 2.4.7) and On Input (WCAG 3.2.2). Popular ad-serving technologies like Taboola, DoubleClick, and RevContent often serve ads that fail to comply with WCAG standards. Even when ads are WCAG compliant, 27% of them have alternative text in ad images that misrepresents information, potentially deceiving users. Manual inspection of a sample of these misleading ads revealed that user-identifiable data is collected on 94% of websites through interactions, such as hovering or pressing enter. Since users with disabilities often rely on tools like screen readers that require hover events to access website content, they have no choice but to compromise their privacy in order to navigate website ads. Based on our findings, we further dissect the root cause of these violations and provide design guidelines to both website developers and ad-serving technologies to achieve WCAG-compliant ad integration.

 Abstract:  As modern web services increasingly rely on REST APIs, their thorough testing has become crucial. Furthermore, the advent of REST API specifications such as OpenAPI ones has led to the emergence of many black-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in detecting faults (i.e., 500 response codes). To address these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box framework to adopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing, integrating Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with a Semantic Property Dependency Graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats REST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents---API, dependency, parameter, and value---collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle domain-specific value restrictions, the SPDG model simplifies the search space for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Evaluated on 12 real-world REST services, AutoRestTest outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which augments realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool able to identify an internal server error in Spotify. Our ablation study underscores the significant contributions of the agent learning, SPDG, and LLM components.  
  
  Geraldine Galindo-Gutierrez, Juan Pablo Sandoval Alcocer, Nicolas Jimenez-Fuentes, Alexandre Bergel, "Gordon Fraser, ""Increasing the Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Tests by Improving Class Observability""  
 Abstract:  Automated unit test generation consists of two complementary challenges: Finding sequences of API calls that exercise the code of a class under test, and finding assertion statements that validate the behaviour of the class during execution. The former challenge is often addressed using meta-heuristic search algorithms optimising tests for code coverage, which are then annotated with regression assertions to address the latter challenge, i.e., assertions that capture the states observed during test generation. While the resulting tests tend to achieve high coverage, their fault finding potential is often inhibited by poor or difficult observability of the codebase. That is, relevant attributes and properties may either not be exposed adequately at all, or only in ways that the test generator is unable to handle. In this paper, we investigate the influence of observability in the context of the EvoSuite search-based Java test generator, which we extend in two complementary ways to study and improve observability: First, we apply a transformation to code under test to expose encapsulated attributes to the test generator; second, we address EvoSuite's limited capability of asserting the state of complex objects. Our evaluation demonstrates that together these observability improvements lead to significantly increased mutation scores, underscoring the importance of considering the class observability in the test generation process.

 Abstract:  Micro frontend (MFE) architectures have gained significant popularity for promoting independence and modularity in development. Despite their widespread adoption, the field remains relatively unexplored, especially concerning identifying problems and documenting best practices. Drawing on both established microservice (MS) anti-patterns and the analysis of real problems faced by software development teams that adopt MFE, this paper presents a catalog of 12 MFE anti-patterns. We composed an initial version of the catalog by recognizing parallels between MS anti-patterns and recurring issues in MFE projects to map and adapt MS anti-patterns to the context of MFE. To validate the identified problems and proposed solutions, we conducted a survey with industry practitioners, collecting valuable feedback to refine the anti-patterns. Additionally, we asked participants if they had encountered these problems in practice and to rate their harmfulness on a 10-point Likert scale. The survey results revealed that participants had encountered all the proposed anti-patterns in real-world MFE architectures, with only one reported by less than 50% of participants. They stated that the catalog can serve as a valuable guide for both new and experienced developers, with the potential to enhance MFE development quality. The collected feedback led to the development of a improved version of the anti-patterns catalog. Furthermore, we developed a web application designed to not only showcase the anti-patterns but also to actively foster collaboration and engagement within the MFE community. The proposed catalog is a valuable resource for identifying and mitigating potential pitfalls in MFE development. It empowers developers of all experience levels to create more robust, maintainable, and well-designed MFE applications.

 Abstract:  Refinement types -- a type-based generalization of Floyd-Hoare logics -- are an expressive and modular means of statically ensuring a wide variety of correctness, safety, and security properties of software. However, their expressiveness and modularity means that to use them, a developer must laboriously \emph{annotate} all the functions in their code with potentially complex type specifications that specify the contract for that function. We present XO, a neurosymbolic agent that uses LLMs to automatically generate refinement type annotations for all the functions in an entire package or module, using the refinement type checker LiquidHaskell as an oracle to verify the correctness of the generated specifications. We curate a dataset of three Haskell packages where refinement types are used to enforce a variety of correctness properties from data structure invariants to low-level memory safety and use this dataset to evaluate XO. Previously these packages required expert users several days to weeks to annotate with refinement types. Our evaluation shows that when even using models with relatively smaller models like the 3 billion parameter StarCoder LLM, by using fine-tuning, carefully chosen contexts, our neurosymbolic agent generates refinement types for up to 94\% of the functions across entire libraries automatically in just a few hours, thereby showing that LLMs can drastically shrink the human effort needed to use formal verification.

 Abstract:  This paper explores the integration of Visual Code Assistants in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). In Software Engineering, whiteboard sketching is often the initial step before coding, serving as a crucial collaboration tool for developers. Previous studies have investigated patterns in SE sketches and how they are used in practice, yet methods for directly using these sketches for code generation remain limited. The emergence of visually-equipped large language models presents an opportunity to bridge this gap, which is the focus of our research. In this paper, we built a first prototype of a Visual Code Assistant to get user feedback regarding in-IDE sketch-to-code tools. We conduct an experiment with 19 data scientists, most of whom regularly sketch as part of their job. We investigate developers' mental models by analyzing patterns commonly observed in their sketches when developing an ML workflow. Analysis indicates that diagrams were the preferred organizational component (52.6\%), often accompanied by lists (42.1\%) and numbered points (36.8\%). Our tool converts their sketches into a Python notebook by querying an LLM. We use an LLM-as-judge setup to score the quality of the generated code, finding that even brief sketching can effectively generate useful code outlines. We also find a significant, positive correlation between sketch time and the quality of the generated code. We conclude the study by conducting extensive interviews to assess the tool's usefulness, explore potential use cases, and understand developers' needs. As noted by participants, promising applications for these assistants include education, prototyping, and collaborative settings. Our findings signal promise for the next generation of Code Assistants to integrate visual information, both to improve code generation and to better leverage developers' existing sketching practices.

 Abstract:  In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost—FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML explainability approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training. We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for the global model’s prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model’s neurons in a given prediction. It then selectively picks a slice of the most crucial neurons in the global model and maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client’s contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-art ML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.

 Abstract:  Intuitively, the more complex a software system is, the harder it is to maintain. Statistically, it is not clear which complexity metrics correlate with maintenance effort; in fact, it is not even clear how to objectively measure maintenance burden, so that developers' sentiment and intuition can be supported by numbers. Without effective complexity and maintenance metrics, it remains difficult to objectively monitor maintenance, control complexity, or justify refactoring. In this paper, we report a large-scale study of 1252 projects written in C++ and Java from Company_X. We collected three categories of metrics: (1) architectural complexity, measured using propagation cost (PC), decoupling level (DL), and structural anti-patterns; (2) maintenance activity, measured using the number of changes, lines of code (LOC) written, and active coding time (ACT) spent on feature-addition vs. bug-fixing, and (3) developer sentiment on complexity and productivity, collected from 7200 survey responses. We statistically analyzed the correlations among these metrics and obtained significant evidence of the following findings: 1) the more complex the architecture is (higher propagation cost, more instances of anti-patterns), the more LOC is spent on bug-fixing, rather than adding new features; 2) developers who commit more changes for features, spend more lines of code on features, or spend more time on features also feel that they are less hindered by technical debt and complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical study establishing the statistical correlation among architectural complexity, maintenance activity, and developer sentiment. The implication is that, instead of solely relying upon developer sentiment and intuition to detect degraded structure or increased burden to evolve, it is possible to objectively and continuously measure and monitor architectural complexity and maintenance difficulty, increasing feature delivery efficiency by reducing architectural complexity and anti-patterns.

 Abstract:  Despite being beneficial for rapid delivery of software, Kubernetes deployments can be susceptible to security attacks, which can cause serious consequences. A systematic characterization of how community-prescribed security configurations, i.e., security configurations that are recommended by security experts, can aid practitioners to secure their Kubernetes deployments. To that end, we conduct an empirical study with 53 security configurations recommended by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), 20 survey respondents, and 356 configuration files obtained from open source software (OSS) repositories and 188 configuration files used by Company-A. From our empirical study, we observe: (i) practitioners can be unaware of prescribed security configurations as 5%~40% of the survey respondents are unfamiliar with 16 prescribed configurations; and (ii) for Company-A and OSS respectively, 18.0% and 17.9% of the configuration files include at least one violation of prescribed configurations. From our evaluation with 5 static application security testing (SAST) tools we find (i) only Kubescape to support all of the prescribed security configurations; (ii) the highest observed precision to be 0.48 and 0.43 respectively, for the Company-A and OSS datasets; and (iii) the highest observed recall to be respectively, 0.53 and 0.65 for the Company-A and OSS datasets. We conclude the paper by providing recommendations for practitioners on how they can use existing SAST tools to secure their Kubernetes deployments.

 Abstract:  We present TopSeed, a new approach that automatically selects optimal seeds to enhance symbolic execution. Recently, the performance of symbolic execution has significantly improved through various state-of-the-art techniques, including search strategies and state-pruning heuristics. However, these techniques have typically demonstrated their effectiveness without considering “seeding”, which efficiently initializes program states for exploration. This paper aims to select valuable seeds from candidate inputs generated during interactions with any symbolic execution technique, without the need for a predefined seed corpus, thereby maximizing the technique’s effectiveness. One major challenge is the vast number of candidates, making it difficult to identify promising seeds. To address this, we introduce a customized online learning algorithm that iteratively groups candidate inputs, ranks each group, and selects a seed from the top-ranked group based on data accumulated during symbolic execution. Experimental results on 17 open-source C programs show that TopSeed significantly enhances four distinct cutting-edge techniques, implemented on top of two symbolic executors, in terms of branch coverage and bug-finding abilities.

 Abstract:  Ensuring usability is crucial for the success of mobile apps. Usability issues can compromise user experience and negatively impact the perceived app quality. This paper presents UX-LLM, a novel tool powered by a Large Vision-Language Model that predicts usability issues in iOS apps. To evaluate the performance of UX-LLM we predicted usability issues in two open-source apps of a medium complexity and asked usability experts to assess the predictions. We also performed traditional usability testing and expert review for both apps and compared the results to those of UX-LLM. UX-LLM demonstrated precision ranging from 0.61 and 0.66 and recall between 0.35 and 0.38, indicating its ability to identify valid usability issues, yet failing to capture the majority of issues. Finally, we conducted a focus group with an app development team of a capstone project developing a transit app for visually impaired persons. The focus group expressed positive perceptions of UX-LLM as it identified unknown usability issues in their app. However, they also raised concerns about its integration into the development workflow, suggesting potential improvements. Our results show that UX-LLM cannot fully replace traditional usability evaluation methods but serves as a valuable supplement particularly for small teams with limited resources, to identify issues in less common user paths, due to its ability to inspect the source code.

 Abstract:  Code generation is to automatically generate source code conforming to a given programming specification, which has received extensive attention especially with the development of large language models (LLMs). Due to the inherent difficulty of code generation, the code generated by LLMs may not be aligned with the specification. Although thought-eliciting prompting techniques have been proposed to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs, producing correct understanding for complicated programming problems remains challenging, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Also, some feedback-based prompting techniques have been proposed to fix incorrect code using error messages produced by test execution. However, when the generated code deviates significantly from the ground truth, they encounter difficulties in improving performance based on such coarse-grained information. In this work, we propose a novel prompting technique, called μFiX, to improve the code generation performance of LLMs by devising both sophisticated thought-eliciting prompting and feedback-based prompting and making the first exploration on their synergy. It first exploits test case analysis to obtain specification understanding and enables a self-improvement process to identify and refine the misunderstanding in the thought-eliciting prompting phase. μFiX further fixes the specification understanding towards the direction reducing the gap between the provided understanding (from the first phase) and the actual understanding implicitly utilized by LLMs for code generation in the feedback-based prompting phase. By improving the understanding with μFiX, the code generation performance of LLMs can be largely improved. Our evaluation on two advanced LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek-Coder) with six widely-used benchmarks by comparing with 15 baselines, demonstrates the effectiveness of μFiX. For example, μFiX outperforms the most effective baseline with an average improvement of 35.62% in terms of Pass@1 across all subjects.

 Abstract:  Despite the increasing popularity of Decentralized Applications (DApps), they are suffering from various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries for profits. Among such vulnerabilities, Read-Only Reentrancy (called ROR in this paper), is an emerging type of vulnerability that arises from the complex interactions between DApps. In recent three years, attack incidents of ROR have already caused around 30M USD losses to the DApp ecosystem. Existing techniques for vulnerability detection in smart contracts can hardly detect Read-Only Reentrancy attacks, due to the lack of tracking and analyzing the complex interactions between multiple DApps. In this paper, we propose SmartReco, a new framework for detecting Read-Only Reentrancy vulnerability in DApps through a novel combination of static and dynamic analysis (i.e., fuzzing) over smart contracts. The key design behind SmartReco is threefold: (1) SmartReco identifies the boundary between different DApps from the heavy-coupled cross-contract interactions. (2) SmartReco performs fine-grained static analysis to locate points of interest (i.e., entry functions) that may lead to ROR. (3) SmartReco utilizes the on-chain transaction data and performs multi-function fuzzing (i.e., the entry function and victim function) across different DApps to verify the existence of ROR. Our evaluation of a manual-labeled dataset with 45 RORs shows that SmartReco achieves an accuracy of 88.63% and a recall of 86.36%. In addition, SmartReco successfully detects 43 new RORs from 123 popular DApps. The total assets affected by such RORs reach around 520,000 USD.

 Abstract:  Proxy has been introduced as a design pattern to separate data and code in an application to two different types of smart contracts, namely proxy and logic contracts, respectively. Data is stored in the proxy contracts, while the code to be executed is fetched from the logic contracts. Proxy patterns facilitate the flexibility of smart contract development by enabling upgradeability, extensibility, code reuse, etc. Despite its popularity and importance, there is currently no systematic study to understand the prevalence, use scenarios, and development pitfalls of proxies. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study on Ethereum proxies. To collect a comprehensive dataset of proxies, we propose ProxyEx, the first framework designed to detect proxy directly from bytecode. Our evaluation shows that ProxyEx achieves over 99% accuracy. With ProxyEx, we collect a large-scale dataset of 2,031,422 proxies from all contracts in Ethereum and conduct the first systematic empirical study. We first measure the total number of proxies and their transaction traffic, to obtain an overall understanding of the status quo of proxies on Ethereum. Then, we categorize the design pattern and use scenarios of proxies into four types: upgradeability, extensibility, code-sharing, and code-hiding. We further identify three types of common pitfalls in proxies: proxy-logic storage collision, logic-logic storage collision, and uninitialized contracts. We also design three checkers for these common pitfalls in proxies by replaying historical transactions. Our study leads to many interesting findings. For instance, we find that upgradeability is not the only reason that developers adopt the proxy pattern in developing Decentralized Applications (DApps). We also find that many proxies suffer from bugs such as storage collision and uninitialized contracts. Our study sheds light on the proxies landscape, and provides valuable insights to future smart contract research on the development, usage, quality assurance, and bug detection of proxies.

 Abstract:  Commit messages concisely describe code changes in natural language and are important for software maintenance. Several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate commit messages, but they still suffer from critical limitations, such as time-consuming training and poor generalization ability. To tackle these limitations, we propose to borrow the weapon of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL). Our intuition is based on the fact that the training corpora of LLMs contain extensive code changes and their pairwise commit messages, which makes LLMs capture the knowledge about commits, while ICL can exploit the knowledge hidden in the LLMs and enable them to perform downstream tasks without model tuning. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs perform on commit message generation via ICL. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to investigate the capability of LLMs to generate commit messages via ICL. Specifically, we first explore the impact of different settings on the performance of ICL-based commit message generation. We then compare ICL-based commit message generation with state-of-the-art approaches on a popular multilingual dataset and a new dataset we created to mitigate potential data leakage. The results show that ICL-based commit message generation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on subjective evaluation and achieves better generalization ability. We further analyze the root causes for LLM’s underperformance and propose several implications, which shed light on future research directions for using LLMs to generate commit messages.  
  
  " Octavio Galland, "Marcel Böhme, ""Invivo Fuzzing by Amplifying Actual Executions""  
 Abstract:  A major bottleneck that remains when fuzzing software libraries is the need for _fuzz drivers_, i.e., the glue code between the fuzzer and the library. Despite years of fuzzing, critical security flaws are still found, e.g., by manual auditing, because the fuzz drivers do not cover the complex interactions between the library and the host programs using it. In this work we propose an alternative approach to library fuzzing, which leverages a valid execution context that is set up by a given program using the library (the _host_), and _amplify_ its execution. More specifically, we execute the host until a designated function from a list of _target_ functions has been reached, and then perform coverage-guided function-level fuzzing on it. Once the fuzzing quota is exhausted, we move on to fuzzing the next target from the list. In this way we not only reduce the amount of manual work needed by a developer to incorporate fuzzing into their workflow, but we also allow the fuzzer to explore parts of the library as they are used in real-world programs that may otherwise not have been tested due to the simplicity of most fuzz drivers.

 Abstract:  A common practice in the reliability engineering of cloud services involves the collection of monitoring metrics, followed by comprehensive analysis to identify performance issues. However, existing methods often fall short of detecting diverse and evolving anomalies across different services. Moreover, there exists a significant gap between the technical and business interpretation of anomalies, i.e., a detected anomaly may not have an actual impact on system performance or user experience. To address these challenges, we propose ADAMAS, an adaptive AutoML-based anomaly detection framework aiming to achieve practical anomaly detection in production cloud systems. To improve the ability of detecting cross-service anomalies, we design a novel unsupervised evaluation function to facilitate the automatic searching of the optimal model structure and parameters. ADAMAS also contains a lightweight human-in-the-loop design, which can efficiently incorporate expert knowledge to adapt to the evolving anomaly patterns and bridge the gap between predicted anomalies and actual business exceptions. Furthermore, through monitoring the rate of mispredicted anomalies, ADAMAS proactively re-configures the optimal model, forming a continuous loop of system improvement. Extensive evaluation on one public and two industrial datasets shows that ADAMAS outperforms all baseline models with a 0.891 F1-score. The ablation study also proves the effectiveness of the evaluation function design and the incorporation of expert knowledge.

 Abstract:  In recent years, security incidents stemming from centralization defects in smart contracts have led to substantial financial losses. A centralization defect refers to any error, flaw, or fault in a smart contract’s design or development stage that introduces a single point of failure. Such defects allow a specific account or user to disrupt the normal operations of smart contracts, potentially causing malfunctions or even complete project shutdowns. Despite the significance of this issue, most current smart contract analyses overlook centralization defects, focusing primarily on other types of defects. To address this gap, our paper introduces six types of centralization defects in smart contracts by manually analyzing 597 Stack Exchange posts and 117 audit reports. For each defect, we provide a detailed description and code examples to illustrate its characteristics and potential impacts. Additionally, we introduce a tool named CDRipper (Centralization Defects Ripper) designed to identify the defined centralization defects. Specifically, CDRipper constructs a permission dependency graph (PDG) and extracts the permission dependencies of functions from the source code of smart contracts. It then detects the sensitive operations in functions and identifies centralization defects based on predefined patterns. We conduct a large-scale experiment using CDRipper on 244,424 real-world smart contracts and evaluate the results based on a manually labeled dataset. Our findings reveal that 82,446 contracts contain at least one of the six centralization defects, with our tool achieving an overall precision of 93.7%.

 Abstract:  Temporal logic specifications play an important role in a wide range of software analysis tasks, such as model checking, automated synthesis, program comprehension, and runtime monitoring. Given a set of positive and negative examples, specified as traces, \emph{LTL learning} is the problem of synthesizing a specification, in \emph{linear temporal logic (LTL)}, that evaluates to true over the positive traces and false over the negative ones. In this paper, we propose a new type of LTL learning problem called \emph{constrained LTL learning}, where the user, in addition to positive and negative examples, is given an option to specify one or more \emph{constraints} over the properties of the LTL formula to be learned. We demonstrate that the ability to specify these additional constraints significantly increases the range of applications for LTL learning, and also allows efficient generation of LTL formulas that satisfy certain desirable properties (such as minimality). We propose an approach for solving the constrained LTL learning problem through an encoding in a first-order relational logic and reduction to an instance of the \emph{maximal satisfiability (MaxSAT)} problem. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that ATLAS, an implementation of our proposed approach, is able to solve new types of learning problems while performing better than or competitively with the state-of-the-art tools in LTL learning.

 Abstract:  Recent research has shown that incorporating bug- related facts, such as stack traces and GitHub issues, into prompts enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs? To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark. Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial. Specifically each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it. Importantly we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM’s performance on a given task instance. We found that there is no one-size- fits-all set of facts for bug repair. Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named MANIPLE, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt. This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set. To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked MANIPLE against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non- conversational LLM-based bug repair methods. On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, MANIPLE repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.

 Abstract:  Modern software projects have been increasingly using cloud services as important components. The cloud-based programming practice greatly simplifies software development by harvesting cloud benefits (e.g., high availability and elasticity). However, it imposes new challenges for software testing and analysis, due to opaqueness of cloud backends and monetary cost of invoking cloud services for continuous integration and deployment. As a result, cloud emulators are developed for offline development and testing, before online testing and deployment. This paper presents a systematic analysis of cloud emulators from the perspective of cloud-based software testing. Our goal is to (1) understand the discrepancies introduced by cloud emula- tion with regard to software quality assurance and deployment safety and (2) address inevitable gaps between emulated and real cloud services. The analysis results are concerning. Among 255 APIs of five cloud services from Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), we detected discrepant behavior between the emulated and real services in 94 (37%) of the APIs. These discrepancies lead to inconsistent testing results, threatening deployment safety, introducing false alarms, and creating debuggability issues. The root causes are diverse, including accidental implementation defects and essential emulation challenges. We discuss potential solutions and develop a practical mitigation technique to address discrepancies of cloud emulators for software testing.

 Abstract:  Mobile accessibility is increasingly important nowadays as it enables people with disabilities to use mobile applications to perform daily tasks. Ensuring mobile accessibility not only benefits those with disabilities but also enhances the user experience for all users, making applications more intuitive and user-friendly. Although numerous tools are available for testing and detecting accessibility issues in Android applications, a large number of false negatives and false positives persist due to limitations in the existing approaches, i.e., low coverage of UI scenarios and lack of consideration of runtime context. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a scenario-driven exploration method for improving the coverage of UI scenarios, thereby detecting accessibility issues within the application, and ultimately reducing false negatives. Furthermore, to reduce false positives caused by not considering the runtime context, we propose a context-aware detection method that provides a more fine-grained detection capability. Our experimental results reveal that A11yScan can detect 1.7X more issues surpassing current state-of-the-art approaches like Xbot (3,991 vs. 2,321), thereby reducing the false negative rate by 41.84\%. Additionally, it outperforms established UI exploration techniques such as SceneDroid (952 vs. 661 UI scenarios), while achieving comparable activity coverage to recent leading GUI testing tools like GPTDroid on the available dataset (73\% vs. 71\%). Meanwhile, with the context-aware detection method, A11yScan effectively reduces the false positive rate by 21\%, validated with a 90.56\% accuracy rate through a user study.

 Abstract:  Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), have started gaining popularity among researchers and software developers for generating source code. However, LLMs have been shown to generate code with quality issues and also incurred copyright/licensing infringements. Therefore, detecting whether a piece of source code is written by humans or AI has become necessary. This study first presents an empirical analysis to investigate the effectiveness of the existing AI detection tools in detecting AI-generated code. The results show that they all perform poorly and lack sufficient generalizability to be practically deployed. Then, to improve the performance of AI-generated code detection, we propose a range of approaches, including fine-tuning the LLMs and machine learning-based classification with static code metrics or code embedding generated from Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Our best model outperforms state-of-the-art AI-generated code detector (GPTSniffer) and achieves an F1 score of 82.55. We also conduct an ablation study on our best-performing model to investigate the impact of different source code features on its performance.

 Abstract:  Modern compilers, such as LLVM, are complex. Due to their complexity, manual testing is unlikely to suffice, yet formal verification is difficult to scale. End-to-end fuzzing can be used, but it has difficulties in discovering LLVM backend problems for two reasons. First, frontend preprocessing and middle optimization shield the backend from seeing diverse inputs. Besides, edge coverages cannot provide an effective feedback as LLVM backend contains much reusable code. In this paper, we implement IRFuzzer to investigate the need of specialized fuzzing of the LLVM compiler backend. We focus on two approaches to improve the fuzzer: guaranteed input validity using constrained mutations to improve input diversity and new metrics to improve feedback quality. The mutator in IRFuzzer is capable of generating a wide range of LLVM IR inputs, including structured control flow, vector types, and function definitions. The system instruments coding patterns in the compiler to monitor the execution status of instruction selection. The instrumentation not only provides a new coverage feedback called matcher table coverage, but also provides an architecture specific guidance to the mutator. We show that IRFuzzer is more effective than existing fuzzers by fuzzing on 29 mature LLVM backend targets. In the process, we reported 78 confirmed new bugs in LLVM upstream, out of which 57 have been fixed, five have been back ported to LLVM 15, showing that specialized fuzzing provides useful and actionable insights to LLVM developers.

 Abstract:  Phone vendors customize their Android variants to enhance system functionalities based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). While independent development, Android variants have to periodically evolve with the upstream AOSP and merge code changes from AOSP. Vendors have invested great effort to maintain their variants and resolve merging conflicts. In this paper, we characterize the design smells with recurring patterns that break the design boundary between Android variants and AOSP. These smells are manifested as problematic dependencies across the boundary, hindering Android variants' maintainability and co-evolution with AOSP. We propose the DroidDS for automatically detecting design smells. We collect 22 Android variant versions and 22 corresponding AOSP versions, involving 4 open-source projects and 1 industrial project. Our results demonstrate that: files involved in design smells consume higher maintenance costs than other files; these infected files are not merely the files with large code size, increased complexity, and object-oriented smells; the infected files have been involved in more than half of code conflicts induced by re-applying AOSP's changes to Android variants; a substantial portion of design issues could be mitigable. Practitioners can utilize our DroidDS to pinpoint and prioritize design problems for Android variants. Refactoring these problems will help keep a healthy coupling between diverse variants and AOSP, potentially improving maintainability and reducing conflict risks.

 Abstract:  Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS’s ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs’ path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs’ PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of the AV’s movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. Therefore, Decictor can generate NoDSs by generating new scenarios and then identifying NoDSs in the new scenarios. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs. It generates 63.9 NoDSs in total, while the best-performing baseline only detects 35.4 NoDSs.

 Abstract:  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has streamlined frontend interface creation through tools like Vercel's V0, yet surfaced challenges in design quality (e.g., accessibility, and usability). Current solutions, often limited by their focus, generalisability, or data dependency, fall short in addressing these complexities comprehensively. Moreover, none of them examine the quality of LLM-generated UI design. In this work, we introduce DesignRepair, a novel dual-stream design guideline-aware system to examine and repair the UI design quality issues from both code aspect and rendered page aspect. We utilised the mature and popular Material Design as our knowledge base to guide this process. Specifically, we first constructed a comprehensive knowledge base encoding Google's Material Design principles into low-level component knowledge base and high-level system design knowledge base. After that, DesignRepair employs a LLM for the extraction of key components and utilizes the Playwright tool for precise page analysis, aligning these with the established knowledge bases. Finally, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation with state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 to holistically refine and repair frontend code through a strategic divide and conquer approach. Our extensive evaluations validated the efficacy and utility of our approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in adherence to design guidelines, accessibility, and user experience metrics.

 Abstract:  The high number of cyber threats poses significant challenges, with impactful software exploits ranging from data theft to ransomware deployment. Unfortunately, past research highlighted limited security expertise within development teams. Collaboration between developers and security experts, therefore, emerges as one of the few workable means to address this gap. In this paper, we explore the complex interplay between developers and security experts within Scrum, one of the most widely adopted frameworks which actively promotes collaboration, to shed light on their working relationship, challenges, and potential avenues for improvement. To this end, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 14 developers and 13 security experts. Our qualitative results reveal three communication patterns and five shared challenges between the groups affecting the develop-security expert collaboration. Top challenges include consistent interaction difficulties and the lack of workable means to balance business and security needs. As a result, we found that three core Scrum values (openness, respect, courage) are missing from this relationship. Based on our results, we propose recommendations for fostering a healthy collaboration between developers and security experts, both within and beyond Scrum.

 Abstract:  The sustainability of open source software (OSS) projects hinges on contributor retention. Interpersonal challenges can inhibit a feeling of welcomeness among contributors, particularly from underrepresented groups, which impacts their decision to continue with the project. How much this impact is, varies among individuals, underlining the importance of a thorough understanding of their effects. Here, we investigate the effects of interpersonal challenges on the sense of welcomeness among diverse populations within OSS, through the diversity lenses of gender, race, and (dis)ability. We analyzed the large-scale Linux Foundation Diversity and Inclusion survey (n = 706) to model a theoretical framework linking interpersonal challenges with the sense of welcomeness through Structural Equation Models Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM). We then examine the model to identify the impact of these challenges on different demographics through Multi-Group Analysis (MGA). Finally, we conducted a regression analysis to investigate how differently people from different demographics experience different types of interpersonal challenges. Our findings confirm the negative association between interpersonal challenges and the feeling of welcomeness in OSS, with this relationship being more pronounced among gender minorities and people with disabilities. We found that different challenges have unique impacts on how people feel welcomed, with variations across gender, race, and disability groups. We also provide evidence that people from gender minorities and with disabilities are more likely to experience interpersonal challenges than their counterparts, especially when we analyze stalking, sexual harassment, and gender. Our insights benefit OSS communities, informing potential strategies to improve the landscape of interpersonal relationships, ultimately fostering more inclusive and welcoming communities.

 Abstract:  Software process models are essential to facilitate collaboration and communication among software teams to solve complex development tasks. Inspired by these software engineering practices, we present FlowGen – a code generation framework that emulates software process models based on multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents. We emulate three process models, FlowGen$_{Waterfall}$, FlowGen$_{TDD}$, and FlowGen$_{Scrum}$, by assigning LLM agents to embody roles (i.e., requirement engineer, architect, developer, tester, and scrum master) that correspond to everyday development activities and organize their communication patterns. The agents work collaboratively using chain-of-thought and prompt composition with continuous self-refinement to improve the code quality. We use GPT-3.5 as our underlying LLM and several baselines (RawGPT, CodeT, Reflexion) to evaluate code generation on four benchmarks: HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET. Our findings show that FlowGen$_{Scrum}$ excels compared to other process models, achieving a Pass@1 of 75.2, 65.5, 82.5, and 56.7 in HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET, respectively (an average of 15% improvement over RawGPT). Compared with other state-of-the-art techniques, FlowGen$_{Scrum}$ achieves a higher Pass@1 in MBPP compared to CodeT, with both outperforming Reflexion. Notably, integrating CodeT into FlowGen$_{Scrum}$ resulted in statistically significant improvements, achieving the highest Pass@1 scores. Our analysis also reveals that the development activities impacted code smell and exception handling differently, with design and code review adding more exception handling and reducing code smells. Finally, FlowGen models maintain stable Pass@1 scores across GPT-3.5 versions and temperature values, highlighting the effectiveness of software process models in enhancing the quality and stability of LLM-generated code.

 Abstract:  Automated Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) landing is crucial for autonomous UAV services such as monitoring, surveying, and package delivery. It involves detecting landing targets, perceiving obstacles, planning collision-free paths, and controlling UAV movements for safe landing. Failures can lead to significant losses, necessitating rigorous simulation-based testing for safety. Traditional offline testing methods, limited to static environments and predefined trajectories, may miss violation cases caused by dynamic objects like people and animals. Conversely, online testing methods require extensive training time, which is impractical with limited budgets. To address these issues, we introduce GARL, a framework combining a genetic algorithm (GA) and reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient generation of diverse and real landing system failures within a practical budget. GARL employs GA for exploring various environment setups offline, reducing the complexity of RL's online testing in simulating challenging landing scenarios. Our approach outperforms existing methods by up to 18.35% in violation rate and 58% in diversity metric. We validate most discovered violation types with real-world UAV tests, pioneering the integration of offline and online testing strategies for autonomous systems. This method opens new research directions for online testing, with our code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/drone_testing-5CF0/.

 Abstract:  Code reuse in software development frequently facilitates the spread of vulnerabilities, making the scope of affected software in CVE reports imprecise. Traditional methods primarily focus on identifying reused vulnerability code within target software, yet they cannot verify if these vulnerabilities can be triggered in new software contexts. This limitation often results in false positives. In this paper, we introduce TransferFuzz, a novel vulnerability verification framework, to verify whether vulnerabilities propagated through code reuse can be triggered in new software. Innovatively, we collected runtime information during the execution or fuzzing of the basic binary (the vulnerable binary detailed in CVE reports). This process allowed us to extract historical traces, which proved instrumental in guiding the fuzzing process for the target binary (the new binary that reused the vulnerable function). TransferFuzz introduces a unique Key Bytes Guided Mutation strategy and a Nested Simulated Annealing algorithm, which transfers these historical traces to implement trace-guided fuzzing on the target binary, facilitating the accurate and efficient verification of the propagated vulnerability. Our evaluation, conducted on widely recognized datasets, shows that TransferFuzz can quickly validate vulnerabilities previously unverifiable with existing techniques. Its verification speed is 2.5 to 26.2 times faster than existing methods. Moreover, TransferFuzz has proven its effectiveness by expanding the impacted software scope for 15 vulnerabilities listed in CVE reports, increasing the number of affected binaries from 15 to 53.

 Abstract:  Resource leaks, caused by resources not being released after acquisition, often lead to performance issues and system crashes. Existing static detection techniques rely on mechanical matching of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and null-checking conditions to find unreleased resources, suffering from both (1) false negatives caused by the incompleteness of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and (2) false positives caused by the incompleteness of resource reachability validation identification. To overcome these challenges, we propose InferROI, a novel approach that leverages the exceptional code comprehension capability of large language models (LLMs) to directly infer resource-oriented intentions (acquisition, release, and reachability validation) in code. InferROI first prompts the LLM to infer involved intentions for a given code snippet, and then incorporates a two-stage static analysis approach to check control-flow paths for resource leak detection based on the inferred intentions. We evaluate the effectiveness of InferROI in both resource-oriented intention inference and resource leak detection. Experimental results on the DroidLeaks and JLeaks datasets demonstrate InferROI achieves promising bug detection rate (59.3% and 62.5%) and false alarm rate (18.6% and 19.5%). Compared to three industrial static detectors, InferROI detects 14~45 and 149~485 more bugs in DroidLeaks and JLeaks, respectively. When applied to real-world open-source projects, InferROI identifies 29 unknown resource leak bugs (verified by authors), with 7 of them being confirmed by developers. In addition, the results of an ablation study underscores the importance of combining LLM-based inference with static analysis. Finally, manual annotation indicated that InferROI achieved a precision of 74.6% and a recall of 81.8% in intention inference, covering more than 60% resource types involved in the datasets.

 Abstract:  Blockchain networks allow multiple client implementations of the same consensus algorithm by different developers to coexist in the same system. Ensuring correct implementations among these heterogeneous clients is crucial, as even slight semantic discrepancies in their implementations can lead to safety failures. While existing fuzzing frameworks have discovered implementation flaws in blockchain, they suffer from several challenges in testing them with sequences of conflicting blocks, called forks. Existing tools fail to adequately assess the fork-handling processes in blockchain implementations when relying on traditional code coverage feedback, which lacks the granularity needed to navigate the diverse and complex fork-handling scenarios. This paper introduces Forky, a fork state-aware differential fuzzing framework designed to detect implementation discrepancies within the critical fork-handling process with its novel fork-aware mutation and fork-diversifying feedback mechanisms. We test Forky on the two most influential blockchain projects: Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the representatives of the two major blockchain consensus algorithm families, Proofof-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms.

 Abstract:  GitHub is one of the largest open-source software (OSS) communities for software development and collaboration. Impersonation in the OSS communities refers to the malicious act of assuming another user's identity, often aiming to gain unauthorized access to code, manipulate project outcomes, or spread misinformation. With several recent real-world attacks resulting from impersonation, this issue is becoming and increasingly problematic concern within the OSS community. We present the first exploration of the impact of impersonation in GitHub. Specifically, we conduct structured interviews with 17 real-world OSS contributors about their perception of impersonation and corresponding mitigations. Our study reveals that, in general, GitHub users lack awareness of impersonation and underestimate the severity of its implications. After witnessing the impersonation, they show significant concern for the OSS community. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that the current best practices (i.e., commit signing) that might mitigate impersonation must be improved to increase widespread acceptance and adoption. We also present and discuss participant perceptions of potential ways to mitigate GitHub impersonation. We collect a dataset comprising 12.5 million commits to investigate the current status of impersonation. Interestingly, we also find out that impersonation is not currently detected. We observe that existing commit histories treat impersonation behavior identically to pull request events, resulting in a lack of detection methods for impersonation.

 Abstract:  Intersectional fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software, demanding fairness across subgroups defined by multiple protected attributes. This paper introduces FairHOME, a novel ensemble approach using higher order mutation of inputs to enhance intersectional fairness of ML software during the inference phase. Inspired by social science theories highlighting the benefits of diversity, FairHOME generates mutants representing diverse subgroups for each input instance, thus broadening the array of perspectives to foster a fairer decision-making process. Unlike conventional ensemble methods that combine predictions made by different models, FairHOME combines predictions for the original input and its mutants, all generated by the same ML model, to reach a final decision. Notably, FairHOME is even applicable to deployed ML software as it bypasses the need for training new models. We extensively evaluate FairHOME against six state-of-the-art fairness improvement methods across 24 decision-making tasks using widely adopted metrics. FairHOME consistently outperforms existing methods across all metrics considered. On average, it enhances intersectional fairness by 47.3%, surpassing the currently best-performing method by 10.1 percentage points.

 Abstract:  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM’s APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM’s pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.

 Abstract:  Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate "natural" code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers. One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code. We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks. While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem. However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage. In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR. By using only the prefix and suffix context of a line or block of code to describe naturalness, we can use LLMs to localize faults and rank patches all while eliminating the dependency for test-suites. We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools. Our proposed method achieves a 108% top-1 score improvement over SBFL. When using entropy for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in top-1. Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite over-fitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.

 Abstract:  [Motivation] Automated bug detection in dynamically typed languages such as Python is essential for maintaining code quality. The lack of mandatory type annotations in such languages can lead to errors that are challenging to identify early with traditional static analysis tools. Recent progress in deep neural networks has led to increased use of neural bug detectors. In statically typed languages, a type checker is integrated into the compiler and thus taken into consideration when the neural bug detector is designed for these languages. [Problem] However, prior studies overlook this aspect during the training and testing of neural bug detectors for dynamically typed languages. When an optional type checker is used, assessing existing neural bug detectors on bugs easily detectable by type checkers may impact their performance estimation. Moreover, including these bugs in the training set of neural bug detectors can shift their detection focus toward the wrong type of bugs. [Contribution] We explore the impact of type checking on various neural bug detectors for variable misuse bugs, a common type targeted by neural bug detectors. Existing synthetic and real-world datasets are type-checked to evaluate the prevalence of type-related bugs. Then, we investigate how type-related bugs influence the training and testing of the neural bug detectors. [Findings] Our findings indicate that existing bug detection datasets contain a significant proportion of type-related bugs. Building on this insight, we discover integrating the neural bug detector with a type checker can be beneficial, especially when the code is annotated with types. Further investigation reveals neural bug detectors perform better on type-related bugs than other bugs. Moreover, removing type-related bugs from the training data helps improve neural bug detectors’ ability to identify bugs beyond the scope of type checkers.

 Abstract:  Data-driven software is increasingly being used as a critical component of automated decision-support systems. Since this class of software learns its logic from historical data, it can encode or amplify discriminatory practices. Previous research on algorithmic fairness has focused on improving “average-case” fairness. On the other hand, fairness at the extreme ends of the spectrum, which often signifies lasting and impactful shifts in societal attitudes, has received significantly less emphasis. Leveraging the statistics of extreme value theory (EVT), we propose a novel fairness criterion called extreme counterfactual discrimination (ECD). This criterion estimates the worst-case amounts of disadvantage in outcomes for individuals solely based on their memberships in a protected group. Utilizing tools from search-based software engineering and generative AI, we present a randomized algorithm that samples a statistically significant set of points from the tail of ML outcome distributions even if the input dataset lacks a sufficient number of relevant samples. We conducted several experiments on four ML models (deep neural networks, logistic regression, and random forests) over 10 socially relevant tasks from the literature on algorithmic fairness. First, we evaluate the generative AI methods and find that they generate sufficient samples to infer valid EVT distribution in 95% of cases. Remarkably, we found that the prevalent bias mitigators reduce the average-case discrimination but increase the worst-case discrimination significantly in 35% of cases. We also observed that even the tail-aware mitigation algorithm MiniMax-Fairness—increased the worst-case discrimination in 30% of cases. We propose a novel ECD-based mitigator that improves fairness in the tail in 90% of cases with no degradation of the average-case discrimination. We hope that the EVT framework serves as a robust tool for evaluating fairness in both average-case and worst-case discrimination.

 Abstract:  Automated library APIs testing is difficult as it requires exploring a vast space of parameter inputs that may involve objects with complex data types. Existing search based approaches, with limited knowledge of relations between object states and program branches, often suffer from the low efficiency issue, i.e., tending to generate invalid inputs. Symbolic execution based approaches can effectively identify such relations, but fail to scale to large programs. In this work, we present an LLM-based input space partitioning testing approach, LISP, for library APIs. The approach leverages LLMs to understand the code of a library API under test and perform input space partitioning based on its understanding and rich common knowledge. Specifically, we provide the signature and code of the API under test to LLMs, with the expectation of obtaining a text description of each input space partition of the API under test. Then, the generated text description is employed to guide the input generation process for each partition, ultimately resulting in test suites that systematically explore the program behavior of the API. We evaluate LISP on 10 popular open-source Java libraries (e.g., apache/commons-lang with 2.6k stars, guava with 48.8k stars on GitHub). Our experiment results show that LISP is effective in library API testing. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tool EvoSuite in terms of branch coverage. On average, LISP achieves 67.82% branch coverage, surpassing EvoSuite by 1.21 times. In total, LISP triggers 404 exceptions or errors in the experiments, and discovers 13 previously unknown vulnerabilities during evaluation, which have been assigned CVE IDs.

 Abstract:  With the advent of data-centric and machine learning (ML) systems, data quality is playing an increasingly critical role for ensuring the overall quality of software systems. Alas, data preparation, an essential step towards high data quality, is known to be a highly effort-intensive process. Although prior studies have dealt with one of the most impacting issues, data pattern violations, we observe that these studies usually require data-specific configurations (i.e., parameterized) or a certain set of fully curated data as learning examples (i.e., supervised). Both approaches require domain knowledge and depend on users' deep understanding of their data, and are often effort-intensive. In this paper, we introduce RIOLU: Regex Inferencer autO-parameterized Learning with Uncleaned data. RIOLU is fully automated, is automatically parameterized, and does not need labeled samples. We observe that RIOLU can generate precise patterns from datasets in various domains, with a high F1 score of 97.2%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline. In addition, according to our experiment on five datasets with anomalies, RIOLU can automatically estimate a data column's error rate, draw normal patterns, and predict anomalies from unlabeled data with higher performance (up to 800.4% improvement in terms of F1) than the state-of-the-art baseline. Furthermore, RIOLU can even outperform ChatGPT in terms of both accuracy (12.3% higher F1) and efficiency (10% less inference time). With user involvement, a variation (a guided version) of RIOLU can further boost its precision (up to 37.4% improvement in terms of F1). Our evaluation in an industrial setting further demonstrates the practical benefits of RIOLU.

 Abstract:  \textit{Background}: Sustainable software development involves creating software in a manner that meets present goals without undermining our ability to meet future goals. In a software engineering context, sustainability has at least four dimensions: ecological, economic, social, and technical. No interventions for improving social sustainability in software engineering have been tested in rigorous lab-based experiments, and little evidence-based guidance is available. \textit{Objective}: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions---stakeholder maps and persona models---for improving social sustainability by improving software feature prioritization. \textit{Method}: We conducted a randomized controlled factorial experiment with 79 undergraduate computer science students. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups and asked to prioritize a backlog of prosocial, neutral, and antisocial user stories for a shopping mall's digital screen display and facial recognition software. Participants received either persona models, a stakeholder map, both, or neither. We compared the differences in prioritization levels assigned to prosocial and antisocial user stories using Cumulative Link Mixed Model regression. \textit{Results}: Participants who received persona models gave significantly lower priorities to anti-social user stories but no significant difference was evident for pro-social user stories. The effects of the stakeholder map were not significant. The interaction effects were not significant. \textit{Conclusion}: Providing aspiring software professionals with well-crafted persona models causes them to de-prioritize anti-social software features. The impact of persona modelling on sustainable software development therefore warrants further study with more experience professionals. Moreover, the novel methodological strategy of assessing social sustainability behavior through backlog prioritization appears feasible in lab-based settings.

 Abstract:  GitHub Copilot is an artificially intelligent program- ming assistant used by many developers. While a few studies have evaluated the security risks of using Copilot, there has not been any study to show if it aids developers in producing code with better runtime performance. We evaluate the runtime performance of C++ code produced when developers use GitHub Copilot versus when they do not. To this end, we conducted a user study with 32 participants where each participant solved two C++ programming problems, one with Copilot and the other without it and measured the runtime performance of the participants’ solutions on our test data. Our results suggest that using Copilot may produce C++ code with a statistically significantly slower runtime performance.

 Abstract:  Modern configurable systems provide tremendous opportunities for engineering future intelligent software systems. A key difficulty thereof is how to effectively self-adapt the configuration of a running system such that its performance (e.g., runtime and throughput) can be optimized under time-varying workloads. This unfortunately remains unaddressed in existing approaches as they either overlook the available past knowledge or rely on static exploitation of past knowledge without reasoning the usefulness of information when planning for self-adaptation. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing DLiSA, a framework that self-adapts configurable systems. DLiSA comes with two properties: firstly, it supports lifelong planning, and thereby the planning process runs continuously throughout the lifetime of the system, allowing dynamic exploitation of the accumulated knowledge for rapid adaptation. Secondly, the planning for a newly emerged workload is boosted via distilled knowledge seeding, in which the knowledge is dynamically purified such that only useful past configurations are seeded when necessary, mitigating misleading information. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed DLiSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating a performance improvement of up to 255\% and a resource acceleration of up to 2.22$\times$ on generating promising adaptation configurations.

 Abstract:  Expert programmers are more effective at coding activities, but the reasons for this remain elusive. Accordingly, recent research has used neuroimaging such as fMRI to analyze how expert programmers might think as they perform coding activities. Those experiments have all involved specific programming tasks (i.e., comprehension), but have been unable to detect systematic differences based on coding experience. By using tasks, however, those studies may limit the number and type of brain networks involved. In Cognitive Neuroscience, researchers commonly analyze resting-state data, in which participants’ brain activity is recorded as they lay idle in the scanner. The brain’s functional organization is plastic, and can change with experience. These changes can be measured at rest, making this a suitable data type for studying how programming activities affect neural organization over time. In this paper, we analyzed the resting state scans from 150 participants, 96 of whom were programmers. We found increased connectivity in programmers between brain regions involved in language, math, and the temporal attention. Non-programmers demonstrated more connectivity with regions involved in social and emotional cognition. We found that as years of programming experience increases, connectivity decreases between two regions associated with visual processing during reading and articulation, respectively.

 Abstract:  GitGuardian monitored secrets exposure in public GitHub repositories and reported that developers leaked over 12 million secrets (database and other credentials) in 2023, indicating a 113\% surge from 2021. Despite the availability of secret detection tools, developers ignore the tools' reported warnings because of false positives (25\%-99\%). However, each secret protects assets of different values accessible through asset identifiers (a DNS name and a public or private IP address). The asset information for a secret can aid developers in filtering false positives and prioritizing secret removal from the source code. However, existing secret detection tools do not provide the asset information, thus presenting difficulty to developers in filtering secrets only by looking at the secret value or finding the assets manually for each reported secret. \textit{The goal of our study is to aid software practitioners in prioritizing secrets removal by providing the assets information protected by the secrets through our novel static analysis tool.} We present AssetHarvester, a static analysis tool to detect secret-asset pairs in a repository. Since the location of the asset can be distant from where the secret is defined, we investigated secret-asset co-location patterns and found four patterns. To identify the secret-asset pairs of the four patterns, we utilized three approaches (pattern matching, data flow analysis, and fast-approximation heuristics). We curated a benchmark of 1,791 secret-asset pairs of four database types extracted from 188 public GitHub repositories to evaluate the performance of AssetHarvester. AssetHarvester demonstrates precision of (97\%), recall (90\%), and F1-score (94\%) in detecting secret-asset pairs. Our findings indicate that data flow analysis employed in AssetHarvester detects secret-asset pairs with 0\% false positives and aids in improving the recall of secret detection tools. Additionally, AssetHarvester shows 43\% increase in precision for database secret detection compared to existing detection tools through the detection of assets, thus reducing developer's alert fatigue.

 Abstract:  Algorithmic fairness of machine learning (ML) models has raised significant concern in the recent years. Many testing, verification, and bias mitigation techniques have been proposed to identify and reduce fairness issues in ML models. The existing methods are *model-centric* and designed to detect fairness issues under *static settings*. However, many ML-enabled systems operate in a dynamic environment where the predictive decisions made by the system *impact* the environment, which in turn affects future decision-making. Such a self-reinforcing *feedback loop* can cause fairness violations in the long term, even if the immediate outcomes are fair. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based framework called FairSense to detect and analyze long-term unfairness in ML-enabled systems. In particular, the framework targets systems with an ML model that is trained over tabular data using supervised learning. Given a fairness requirement, FairSense performs *Monte-Carlo simulation* to enumerate evolution traces for each system configuration. Then, FairSense performs *sensitivity analysis* on the space of system parameters to understand the impact of configuration decisions on long-term fairness of the system. We demonstrate FairSense's potential utility through three real-world case studies: Loan lending, opioids risk scoring, and predictive policing.

 Abstract:  Automated program repair has emerged as a powerful technique to mitigate the impact of software bugs on system reliability and user experience. This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike existing deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed prompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capable of autonomously planning and executing actions to fix bugs by invoking suitable tools. RepairAgent freely interleaves gathering information about the bug, gathering repair ingredients, and validating fixes, while deciding which tools to invoke based on the gathered information and feedback from previous fix attempts. Key contributions that enable RepairAgent include a set of tools that are useful for program repair, a dynamically updated prompt format that allows the LLM to interact with these tools, and a finite state machine that guides the agent in invoking the tools. Our evaluation on the popular Defects4J dataset demonstrates RepairAgent’s effectiveness in autonomously repairing 164 bugs, including 39 bugs not fixed by prior techniques. Interacting with the LLM imposes an average cost of 270,000 tokens per bug, which, under the current pricing of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model, translates to 14 cents per bug. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present an autonomous, LLM-based agent for program repair, paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.

 Abstract:  Improper parsing of attacker-controlled input is a leading source of software security vulnerabilities, especially when programmers transcribe informal format descriptions into efficient parsing logic in low-level, memory unsafe languages. Several researchers have proposed formal specification languages for data formats from which efficient code can be extracted. However, distilling informal requirements into formal specifications is challenging and, despite their benefits, new, formal languages are hard for people to learn and use. In this work, we present 3DGen, a framework that makes use of AI agents to transform mixed informal input, including natural language documents and example inputs into format specifications in a language called 3D. To support humans in understanding and trusting the generated specifications, 3DGen uses symbolic methods to also synthesize test inputs that can be validated against an external oracle. Symbolic test generation also helps in distinguishing multiple plausible solutions. Through a process of repeated refinement, 3DGen produces a 3D specification that conforms to a test suite, and which yields safe, efficient, provably correct, parsing code in C. We have evaluated 3DGen on 20 Internet standard formats, demonstrating the potential for AI-agents to produce formally verified C code at a non-trivial scale. A key enabler is the use of a domain-specific language to limit AI outputs to a class for which automated, symbolic analysis is tractable.

 Abstract:  Third-party libraries like Log4j accelerate software application development but introduce substantial risk. Vulnerabilities in these libraries have led to Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks that compromised resources within the host system. These attacks benefit from current application permissions approaches: third-party libraries are implicitly trusted in the application runtime. An application runtime designed with Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles — secure access to resources, continuous monitoring, and least-privilege enforcement — could mitigate SSC attacks, as it would give zero implicit trust to these libraries. However, no individual security defense incorporates these principles at a low runtime cost. This paper proposes Zero-Trust Dependencies (ZTD) to mitigate SSC vulnerabilities: we apply the NIST ZTA to software applications. First, we assess the expected effectiveness and configuration cost of Zero-Trust Dependencies using a study of third-party software libraries and their vulnerabilities. Then, we present a system design, $ZTD_{sys}$, that enables the application of Zero-Trust Dependencies to software applications and a prototype, $ZTD_{JAVA}$, for Java applications. Finally, with evaluations on recreated vulnerabilities and realistic applications, we show that $ZTD_{JAVA}$ can defend against prevalent vulnerability classes, introduces negligible cost, and is easy to configure and use.

 Abstract:  Hallucinations, the tendency to produce irrelevant/incorrect responses, are prevalent concerns in generative AI-based tools like ChatGPT. Although hallucinations in ChatGPT are studied for textual responses, it is unknown how ChatGPT hallucinates for technical texts that contain both textual and technical terms. We surveyed 47 software engineers and produced a benchmark of 412 Q&A pairs from the bug reports of two OSS projects. We find that a RAG-based ChatGPT (i.e., ChatGPT tuned with the benchmark issue reports) is 36.4% correct when producing answers to the questions, due to two reasons 1) limitations to understand complex technical contents in code snippets like stack traces, and 2) limitations to integrate contexts denoted in the technical terms and texts. We present CHIME (ChatGPT Inaccuracy Mitigation Engine) whose underlying principle is that if we can preprocess the technical reports better and guide the query validation process in ChatGPT, we can address the observed limitations. CHIME uses context-free grammar (CFG) to parse stack traces in technical reports. CHIME then verifies and fixes ChatGPT responses by applying metamorphic testing and query transformation. In our benchmark, CHIME shows 30.3% more correction over ChatGPT responses. In a user study, we find that the improved responses with CHIME are considered more useful than those generated from ChatGPT without CHIME

 Abstract:  Software defects heavily affect software's functionalities and may cause huge losses. Recently, many AI-based approaches have been proposed to detect defects, which can be divided into two categories: software defect prediction and automatic unit test generation. While these approaches have made great progress in software defect detection, they still have several limitations in practical application, including the low confidence of prediction models and the inefficiency of unit testing models. To address these limitations, we propose a WYSIWYG (i.e., What You See Is What You Get) approach: \textbf{A}ttention-based Self-guided Automatic \textbf{U}nit Test \textbf{G}en\textbf{ER}ation (AUGER), which contains two stages: defect detection and error triggering. In the former stage, \toolname first detects the proneness of defects. Then, in the latter stage, it guides to generate unit tests for triggering such an error with the help of critical information obtained by the former stage. To evaluate the effectiveness of \toolname, we conduct a large-scale experiment by comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the widely used datasets (i.e., Bears, Bugs.jar, and Defects4J). AUGER makes great improvements by 4.7\% to 35.3\% and 17.7\% to 40.4\% in terms of F1-score and Precision in defect detection, and can trigger 23 to 84 more errors than SOTAs in unit test generation. Besides, we also conduct a further study to verify the generalization in practical usage by collecting a new dataset from real-world projects.

 Abstract:  Formal verification is a crucial means to assure software quality. Regrettably, the manual composition of verification scripts proves to be both laborious and time-consuming. In response, researchers have put forth automated theorem prover approaches; however, these approaches still grapple with several limitations. These limitations encompass insufficient handling of lengthy proof steps, difficulty in aligning the various components of a Coq program with the requirements and constraints of the proof goal, and inefficiencies. To surmount these limitations, we present Gpass, a goal-adaptive neural theorem prover based on deep learning technology. Firstly, we design a unique sequence encoder for Gpass that completely scans previous proof tactics through multiple sliding windows and provides information related to the current proof step. Secondly, Gpass incorporates a goal-adaptive feature integration module to align the reasoning process with the requirements of the proof goal. Finally, we devise a parameter selection method based on loss values and loss slopes to procure parameter sets with diverse distributions, thereby facilitating the exploration of various proof tactics. Experimental results demonstrate that Gpass attains better performance on the extensive CoqGym benchmark and proves 11.03\%-96.37\% more theorems than the prior work most closely related to ours. We find that the orthogonality between Gpass and CoqHammer proves their complementary capabilities, and together they prove a total of 3,774 theorems, which is state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we propose an efficiency optimisation approach that allows Gpass to achieve performance beyond Diva at one-sixth of the parameter sets.

 Abstract:  Illicit apps have emerged as a thriving underground industry, driven by their substantial profitability. These apps either offer users restricted services (e.g., porn and gambling) or engage in fraudulent activities like scams. Despite the widespread presence of illicit apps, scant attention has been directed towards this issue, with several existing detection methods predominantly relying on static analysis alone. However, given the burgeoning trend wherein an increasing number of mobile apps achieve their core functionality through dynamic resource loading, depending solely on static analysis proves inadequate. To address this challenge, in this paper, we introduce TacDroid, a novel approach that integrates dynamic analysis for dynamic content retrieval with static analysis to mitigate the limitations inherent in both methods, i.e., the low coverage of dynamic analysis and the low accuracy of static analysis. Specifically, TacDroid conducts both dynamic and static analyses on an Android app to construct dynamic and static User Interface Transition Graphs (UTGs), respectively. These two UTGs are then correlated to create an intermediate UTG. Subsequently, TacDroid embeds graph structure and utilizes an enhanced Graph Autoencoder (GAE) model to predict transitions between nodes. Through link prediction, TacDroid effectively eliminates false positive transition edges stemming from misjudgments in static analysis and supplements false negative transition edges overlooked in the intermediate UTG, thereby generating a comprehensive and accurate UTG. Finally, TacDroid determines the legitimacy of an app and identifies its category based on the app's UTG. Our evaluation results highlight the outstanding accuracy of TacDroid in detecting illicit apps. It significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art work, achieving an F1-score of 96.73%. This work represents a notable advancement in the identification and categorization of illicit apps.  
  
  " Ravishka Rathnasuriya, Zijie Zhao, Wei Yang, "CodeImprove: Program Adaptation for Deep Code Models"  
 Abstract:  Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software engineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer performance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts). Retraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model updates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can be achieved by two steps: 1) input validation that focuses on identifying whether an input is an out-of-scope input program that are beyond a model’s handling capability, and 2) input adaptation that adapts out-of-scope inputs to become in-scope inputs. Validating program input is challenging, as current techniques focus on continuous inputs such as image data and fail with discrete inputs like code data, which have unique characteristics and are processed differently by deep learning models. Adapting out-of-scope programs is also challenging due to their vast search spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose CodeImprove, which distinguishes out-of-scope from normal inputs and converts such out-of-scope inputs back to in-scope inputs through program transformation. In particular, we propose a validity score metric to identify out-of-scope inputs and leverage genetics algorithms to apply semantic preserving program transformation to convert out-of-scope inputs to in-scope inputs. Our experimental results show CodeImprove can enhance upto 8.78% of accuracy, and 51.28% of relative improvements in three code models on two SE tasks. Additionally, our input validation is promising in detecting outof-scope inputs (AUC score of 0.924).

 Abstract:  Numerous machine learning (ML) models have been developed, including those for software engineering (SE) tasks, under the assumption that training and testing data come from the same distribution. However, train and test distributions often differ, as training datasets rarely encompass the entire distribution, while test distribution tends to shift over time. Hence, when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) instances that differ from the training data, a reliable and trustworthy SE ML model must be capable of detecting them to either abstain from making predictions, or potentially forward these OODs to appropriate models handling other categories or tasks. In this paper, we develop two types of SE-specific OOD detection models, unsupervised and weakly-supervised OOD detection for code. The unsupervised OOD detection approach is trained solely on in-distribution samples while the weakly-supervised approach utilizes a tiny number of OOD samples to further enhance the detection performance in various OOD scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines in detecting OOD samples from four different scenarios simultaneously and also positively impact a main code understanding task.

 Abstract:  Many popular programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, support exceptions. Exceptions are thrown during program execution if an unwanted event happens, e.g., a method is invoked with an illegal argument value. Software developers write exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) to check that their code detects unwanted events and throws appropriate exceptions. Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their efforts on “happy paths”, e.g., paths without unwanted events. To help developers fill the gap, we present the first framework, dubbed EXLÓNG, that automatically generates EBTs. EXLÓNG is a large language model instruction-tuned from CodeLlama and embeds reasoning about traces that lead to throw statements, conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional behavior tests that execute similar traces. We compare EX LÓNG with the state-of-the-art models for test generation (CAT-LM) and one of the strongest foundation models (GPT3.5), as well as with analysis-based tools for test generation (Randoop and EvoSuite). Our results show that EXLÓNG outperforms existing models and tools. Furthermore, we contributed several pull requests to open-source projects and 23 EBTs generated by EXLÓNG were already accepted.

In this paper, we look at hybrid quantum-classical computing from a software engineering perspective and present the first empirical study focused on characterizing and evaluating recurrent issues faced by developers of hybrid quantum-classical applications. The study comprised a thorough analysis of 531 real-world issues faced by developers -- including software faults, hardware failures, quantum library errors, and developer mistakes -- documented in discussion threads from forums dedicated to quantum computing. By qualitatively analyzing such forum threads, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of recurring issues in hybrid quantum-classical applications that can be used by both application and platform developers to improve the reliability of hybrid applications. The study considered how these recurring issues manifest and their causes, determining that hybrid applications are crash-dominant (74% of studied issues) and that errors were predominantly introduced by application developers (70% of issues). We conclude by identifying recurring obstacles for developers of hybrid applications and actionable recommendations to overcome them.

 Abstract:  Unit testing improves software quality by evaluating isolated sections of the program. This approach alleviates the need for comprehensive program-wide testing and confines the potential error scope within the software. However, unit test development is time-consuming, requiring developers to create appropriate test contexts and determine input values to cover different code regions. This problem is particularly pronounced in Rust due to its intricate type system, making traditional unit test generation tools ineffective in Rust projects. Recently, LLM have demonstrated their proficiency in understanding programming language and completing software engineering tasks. However, merely prompting LLM with a basic prompt like ""generate unit test for the following source code"" often results in code with compilation errors. In addition, LLM-generated unit tests often have limited test coverage. To bridge this gap and harness the capabilities of LLM, we design and implement RUG, an end-to-end solution to automatically generate the unit test for Rust projects. To help LLM's generated test pass Rust strict compilation checks, RUG designs a semantic-aware bottom-up approach to divide the context construction problem into dependent sub-problems. It solves these sub-problems sequentially using an LLM and merges them to a complete context. To increase test coverage, RUG integrates coverage-guided fuzzing with LLM to prepare fuzzing harnesses. Applying RUG on 17 real-world Rust programs (average 24,937 LoC), we show that RUG can achieve a high code coverage, up to 71.37%, closely comparable to human effort (73.18%). We submitted 113 unit tests generated by RUG covering the new code: 53 of them have been accepted, 17 were rejected, and 43 are pending for review.  
  
  " Smit Soneshbhai Patel, Aashish Yadavally, Hridya Dhulipala, Tien N. Nguyen, "Planning a Large Language Model for Static Detection of Runtime Errors in Code Snippets"  
 Abstract:  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been excellent in generating and reasoning about source code and the textual descriptions. They can recognize patterns, syntax, and semantics in code, making them effective in several software engineering tasks. However, they exhibit weaknesses in reasoning about the program execution. They primarily operate on static code representations, failing to capture the dynamic behavior and state changes that occur during program execution. In this paper, we advance the capabilities of LLMs in reasoning about program execution. We propose ORCA, a novel approach that instructs an LLM to autonomously formulate a plan to navigate through a control flow graph (CFG) for predictive execution of (in)complete code snippets. It acts as a predictive interpreter to ``execute'' the code. As a downstream task, we use ORCA to statically identify any runtime errors for online code snippets. Early detection of runtime errors and defects in these snippets is crucial to prevent costly fixes later in the development cycle after they were adapted into a codebase. In our novel technique, we guide the LLM to pause at the branching point, focusing on the state of the symbol tables for variables' values, thus minimizing error propagation in the LLM's computation. We also instruct the LLM not to stop at each step in its execution plan, resulting the use of only one prompt to the LLM, thus much cost-saving. Our empirical evaluation showed that ORCA is effective and improves over the state-of-the-art approaches in predicting the execution traces and in runtime error detection.

 Abstract:  In the software development process, formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages, including requirement analysis, software testing, and verification. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, it is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have emerged. However, existing methods usually rely on predefined templates or grammar, making them struggle to accurately describe the behavior and functionality of complex real-world programs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification generation based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our key insight is to overcome the limitations of existing methods by leveraging the code comprehension capability of LLMs. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases. The first phase employs a conversational approach that guides the LLM to generate appropriate specifications for a given program, aiming to utilize the ability of LLM to generate high-quality specifications. The second phase, designed for where the LLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators to the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications from the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy by assigning different weights of variants in an efficient manner. We evaluate SpecGen on two datasets, including the SV-COMP Java category benchmark and a manually constructed dataset containing 120 programs. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen succeeds in generating verifiable specifications for 279 out of 385 programs, outperforming the existing LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon. Further investigations on the quality of generated specifications indicate that SpecGen can comprehensively articulate the behaviors of the input program.  
  
  " Yifeng Di, Tianyi Zhang, "Enhancing Code Generation via Bidirectional Comment-Level Mutual Grounding"  
 Abstract:  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 16.9\% Pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7\% faster and with 10.5\% improvement in task success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence.

 Abstract:  Identifying recurring vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring software security. Clone-based techniques, while widely used, often generate many false alarms due to the existence of similar but patched (SBP) code, which is similar to vulnerable code but is not vulnerable due to having been patched. Although the SBP code poses a great challenge to the effectiveness of existing approaches, it has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we propose a programming language agnostic framework, Fixed Vulnerability Filter (FVF), to identify and filter such SBP instances in vulnerability detection. Different from existing studies that leverage function signatures, our approach analyzes code change histories to precisely pinpoint SBPs and consequently reduce false alarms. Evaluation under practical scenarios confirms the effectiveness and precision of our approach. Remarkably, FVF identifies and filters 65.1% of false alarms from four vulnerability detection tools (i.e., ReDeBug, VUDDY, MVP, and an elementary hash-based approach) without yielding false positives. We further apply FVF to 1,081 real-world software projects and construct a real-world SBP dataset containing 6,827 SBP functions. Due to the SBP nature, the dataset can act as a strict benchmark to test the sensitivity of the vulnerability detection approach in distinguishing real vulnerabilities and SBPs. Using this dataset, we demonstrate the ineffectiveness of four state-of-the-art deep learning-based vulnerability detection approaches. Our dataset can help developers make a more realistic evaluation of vulnerability detection approaches and also paves the way for further exploration of real-world SBP scenarios.

 Abstract:  Code retrieval, which retrieves code snippets based on users’ natural language descriptions, is widely used by developers and plays a pivotal role in real-world software development. The advent of deep learning has shifted the retrieval paradigm from lexical-based matching towards leveraging deep learning models to encode source code and queries into vector representations, facilitating code retrieval according to vector similarity. Despite the effectiveness of these models, managing large-scale code bases presents significant challenges. Previous research propose deep hashing-based methods, which generate hash codes for queries and code snippets and use Hamming distance for rapid recall of code candidates. However, this approach’s reliance on linear scanning of the entire code base limits its scalability. To further improve the efficiency of large scale code retrieval, we propose a novel approach SECRET (Scalable and Efficient Code Retrieval via SegmEnTed deep hashing). SECRET converts long hash codes calculated by existing deep hashing approaches into several short hash code segments through an iterative training strategy. After training, SECRET recalls code candidates by looking up the hash tables for each segment, the time complexity of recall can thus be greatly reduced. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SECRET can drastically reduce the retrieval time by at least 95% while achieving comparable or even higher performance of existing deep hashing approaches. Besides, SECRET also exhibits superior performance and efficiency compared to the classical hash table-based approach known as LSH under the same number of hash tables.

 Abstract:  One major challenge of regression testing is the presence of flaky tests, i.e., tests that may pass in one run but fail in another run for the same version of code. One prominent category of flaky tests are order-dependent (OD) flaky tests, which are tests that can pass or fail depending on the test-order in which the tests are run. To help developers debug and fix OD tests, prior work has attempted to automatically find OD-relevant tests, i.e., tests that will determine whether an OD test passes or fails depending on whether the OD-relevant tests are run before or after the OD test in the test-order. Prior work finds OD-relevant tests by running tests before the OD test, without regards to the tests’ likelihood of being OD-relevant tests. We propose RankF to rank tests in order of likelihood of being OD-relevant tests, so a developer can find the first OD-relevant test more quickly, without running tests as often. We propose two ranking approaches, each requiring different information. Our first approach, RankFL, relies on training a large-language model that analyzes test code. Our second approach, RankFO, relies on the analysis of prior test-order execution information. We evaluate our approaches on 155 OD tests from 34 modules across 24 open-source projects. We compare RankF against prior work baselines in terms of the time for finding the first OD-relevant test for an OD test. RankF on average finds the first OD-relevant test faster than the best of the baselines, providing speedups of 1.9X, 1.7X, and 2.6X for the three different types of OD-relevant tests we evaluate.  
  
  " Hang Du, Vijay Krishna Palepu, James A. Jones, "Leveraging Propagated Infection to Crossfire Mutants"  
 Abstract:  Mutation testing was proposed to identify weaknesses in test suites by repeatedly generating artificially faulty versions of the software (i.e., *mutants*) and determining if the test suite is sufficient to detect them (i.e., *kill* them). When the tests are insufficient, each surviving mutant provides an opportunity to improve the test suite. We conducted a study and found that many such surviving mutants (up to 84% for the subjects of our study) are detectable by simply augmenting existing tests with additional assertions, or *assertion amplification*. Moreover, we find that many of these mutants are detectable by multiple existing tests, giving developers options for how to detect them. To help with these challenges, we created a technique that performs memory-state analysis to identify candidate assertions that developers can use to detect the surviving mutants. Additionally, we build upon prior research that identifies "crossfiring" opportunities -- tests that coincidentally kill multiple mutants. To this end, we developed a theoretical model that describes the varying granularities that crossfiring can occur in the existing test suite, which provide opportunities and options for how to kill surviving mutants. We operationalize this model to an accompanying technique that optimizes the assertion amplification of the existing tests to crossfire multiple mutants with fewer added assertions, optionally concentrated within fewer tests. Our experiments show that we can kill *all* surviving mutants that are detectable with existing test data with only 1.1% of the identified assertion candidates, and increasing by a factor of 6x, on average, the number of killed mutants from amplified tests, over tests that do not crossfire.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

21. Conference SOSP_0:
S O S P . O R G |  
  
  The ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) is a conference that brings together developers and researchers from academia and industry to advance the science and technology in operating systems. The conference is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Operating Systems (SIGOPS)  . It has been held once every two years since 1967, when the first SOSP conference took place in Gatlinburg Tennessee. Information on SOSP conferences is provided below.

 Event Venue  
 SOSP goes 🤠  

 Austin, Texas  
 Austin is the capital city of the U.S. state of Texas, the 10th most populous city in the United States, and known as the "The Live Music Capital of the World", a reference to the city's many musicians and live music venues. The city also adopted "Silicon Hills" as a nickname due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies, and has the unofficial slogan "Keep Austin Weird", which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. Since the late 19th century, Austin has also been known as the "City of the Violet Crown", because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset.

 Topics  
   
 SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.  

 Submission Criteria  
   
 Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:  
 Motivate a significant problem; 
  Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution; 
  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution; 
  Draw appropriate conclusions; 
  Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and 
  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work. 
  We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.  

 Originality  
   
 Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.  
 Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. Self-comparisons should be properly anonymized, as described below.  
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta.  
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.  

 Resubmissions  
   
 Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form.  

 Anonymity  
   
 SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name.  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say "Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]".  
 For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, please email the PC chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) a copy of your other concurrent submission.  
 If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization.  
 Check with the program chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.  

 Supplementary Material  
   
 Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.  

 Formatting  
   
 Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .  
 Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.  
 Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN LaTeX  or MS Word templates  from the ACM.  
 For Latex, we recommend you use:  
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart} \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} ... \settopmatter{printfolios=true} \maketitle \pagestyle{plain} ...   

 Confidentiality  
   
 Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.  

 Conflicts  
   
 To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institutional:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2022), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaborator:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2022 or later).  
 Personal:  You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings).  
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ).  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”.  

 Author Response Period  
   
 SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials.  
 Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.  

 Accepted Papers  
   
 Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go to https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access  . Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .

 Call for Hosting Proposals -  
  46th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'2025)  
   
 Date: Mon, 25 Sep 2023 12:56:55 -0400 From: Harini Ramaprasad <00000225842b62b2-dmarc-request@CS-LISTSERV.IEEE.ORG> Subject: [TCRTS] Call for Proposals to Host RTSS 2025 To: tcrts@computer.org The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference on real-time systems. The IEEE Technical Community on Real-Time Systems (TCRTS) is currently soliciting proposals for hosting RTSS in early December 2025, as a hybrid event. RTSS follows a regular rotation around the globe. With RTSS 2023 in Taipei Taiwan, and RTSS 2024 in York, UK, RTSS 2025 is scheduled to be held in North America. Preference will be given to locations in North America; however, if we do not receive a sufficient number of proposals from North America, other regions will be considered. At this point, we are looking for informal proposals (an email will suffice) that indicate the proposed location and the local organizing team. A detailed budget is not yet required, but information about potential meeting rooms, hotels, transportation, tourist attractions, etc. would be helpful. The TCRTS Executive Committee will review all submitted proposals and will invite a number of proposing teams to submit a detailed budget (using a standardized spreadsheet) and present the proposal to the community at RTSS 2023 (ideally in person, though if necessary on-line presentations may be possible). A vote by RTSS attendees (subject to confirmation by the TCRTS EC) will then select the winning proposal. The informal e-mails should be submitted to me at cdgill@wustl.edu no later than October 15th, 2023, and invitations to submit a budget and present the proposal will be sent (along with a budget template) by October 22nd, 2023 with first drafts of the budget and presentation slides due back to me by November 22, 2023. Please consider volunteering to host RTSS 2025! Thanks and best regards Chris Gill Chair, IEEE Technical Community on Real-Time Systems (TCRTS)     To the Ada-Belgium home page.

 A Decision Tool for the Water-Energy Nexus in Jordan  
 Jordan is currently facing a serious problem of water scarcity. It is the fourth water-scarce country in the world. The sustainability of water supply in Jordan is affected not only by the depletion of water reserves but also by increasing electricity tariffs.  
  In the paper submitted to the SOMET 2020 conference, Nadejda Komendantova, Love Ekenberg and Mats Danielson present results regarding the water-energy nexus governance in Jordan using a computer-supported co-creative approach for evaluating stakeholder preferences on criteria and possible scenarios of development for the sectors. They describe a decision support tool and a methodology for evaluating stakeholder preferences for both sectors and on possible scenarios of development for the water and energy sectors. They rate the potential future of energy and water using a set of sector-relevant criteria while considering entire ranges of possible alternative values and criteria weights. By using second-order probabilistic considerations, they furthermore analyze how plausible it is that a scenario outranks the others.

 Conference | November 4-6, 2024 | Conference Site 

 Topics  
   
 SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.  

 Submission Criteria  
   
 Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:  
 Motivate a significant problem; 
  Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution; 
  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution; 
  Draw appropriate conclusions; 
  Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and 
  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work. 
  We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.  

 Originality  
   
 Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.  
 Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. Self-comparisons should be properly anonymized, as described below.  
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta.  
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.  

 Resubmissions  
   
 Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form.  

 Anonymity  
   
 SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name.  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say "Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]".  
 For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, please email the PC chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) a copy of your other concurrent submission.  
 If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization.  
 Check with the program chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.  

 Supplementary Material  
   
 Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.  

 Formatting  
   
 Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .  
 Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.  
 Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN LaTeX  or MS Word templates  from the ACM.  
 For Latex, we recommend you use:

 Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.  

 Conflicts  
   
 To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institutional:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2022), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaborator:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2022 or later).  
 Personal:  You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings).  
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ).  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”.  

 Author Response Period  
   
 SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials.  
 Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.  

 Accepted Papers  
   
 Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go to https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access  . Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.

 SOSP 2024 Call for Papers

 Topics  
   
 SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.  

 Submission Criteria  
   
 Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:  
 Motivate a significant problem; 
  Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution; 
  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution; 
  Draw appropriate conclusions; 
  Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and 
  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work. 
  We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.  

 Originality  
   
 Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.  
 Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. Self-comparisons should be properly anonymized, as described below.  
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta.  
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.  

 Resubmissions  
   
 Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form.  

 Anonymity  
   
 SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name.  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say "Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]".  
 For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, please email the PC chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) a copy of your other concurrent submission.  
 If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization.  
 Check with the program chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.  

 Supplementary Material  
   
 Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.  

 Formatting  
   
 Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .  
 Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.  
 Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN LaTeX  or MS Word templates  from the ACM.  
 For Latex, we recommend you use:  
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart} \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} ... \settopmatter{printfolios=true} \maketitle \pagestyle{plain} ...   

 Confidentiality  
   
 Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.  

 Conflicts  
   
 To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institutional:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2022), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaborator:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2022 or later).  
 Personal:  You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings).  
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ).  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”.  

 Author Response Period  
   
 SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials.  
 Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.  

 Accepted Papers  
   
 Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go to https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access  . Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.

  “In-Person Conference Registration – Author” are dedicated for authors of conference, Work-in-Progress (WIP) papers in RTSS 2024.  
 1. Each accepted main conference or Work-in-Progress (WiP) must be supported by the Author Registration of at least one of its authors. (At any applicable rate, including the student’s rate).  
 2. A single Author Registration may be used to support at most 2 of the above mentioned papers (Conference Papers, WIP papers).  
 3. At least one author of each paper is expected to attend the conference in person and present the paper – hence author registrations are for physical participation only.  
 4. Presenters of RTSS@Work or WaP papers can register at the In-Person Conference Registration category.

 USENIX ATC '25:  2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference | July 7, 2025  – July 9, 2025   , Boston, MA, United States | Abstract registrations due: | January 7, 2025 - 3:59 pm | The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting. | We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. | Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. | Read More

 Call for Papers: Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025  
 The call for papers is now open.  

 The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy. USEC ’25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas. We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields.  
 To honor significant contributions that have had a lasting impact on the field, USEC ’25 will also feature a Test of Time Award  . This award will celebrate research demonstrating enduring relevance and influence in usable security and privacy over the past 14 years of USEC. We will invite nominations for this award from the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and authors submitting their works to USEC ’25. This recognition will honor research that continues to shape and inspire current and future investigations in the discipline.  

 Submission Guidelines for Papers  
 All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. All papers should be written in English. We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use the templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events  .  
 Research Track:  The research track is intended to report on mature work that has been completed. The goal of the USEC’s research track is to disseminate results of interest to the broader usable security and privacy community. Papers must not be more than 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Try to scale the length of the paper according to the contributions you describe therein. Authors have the option to attach to their paper‘s supplementary appendices with study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Meta-Science Track:  The Meta-Science Track is intended to report on mature work and seeks to disseminate results that contribute to the broader understanding and improvement of research practices, including the replicability of studies and the systematization of existing knowledge. Submissions in this track may include comprehensive evaluations of research methodologies, studies that replicate and verify prior findings, meta-analyses that synthesize existing literature, and SoK papers that systematically organize and analyze research in a specific domain. Papers must not exceed 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Vision Track:  The vision track is intended to report on work in progress or concrete ideas for work that has yet to begin. The focus of the vision track is to spark discussion with the goal of providing the authors helpful feedback, pointers to potentially related investigations, and new ideas to explore. Suitable submissions to the vision track include traditional work-in-progress pieces such as preliminary results of pre-studies but also research proposals and position papers outlining future research. Papers must be up to 5 pages in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.  
 The submission portal for papers: https://usec25.hotcrp.com/    
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Areas of Interest  
 Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
  New applications of existing models or technology 
  Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned 
  Security testing of new or existing usability features 
  Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy 
  Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research 
    
 Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments 
  Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience 
  Systematization of Knowledge 
  Inclusive security and privacy 
  Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research 
  Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems 
  Usability in smart manufacturing 

 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline: | 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, | Anywhere-on-earth (AOE) 
  Reviews Due: 16 December 2024 
  Discussion Period: 16-19 December 2024 
  Notification of Acceptance: 20 December 2024 
  Camera Ready Deadline: 28 January 2025 
  Workshop Date: 24 February 2025 
  Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.

 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA  
 46th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call for Papers   
 Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.  
 Topics of interest include:   
 Applied cryptography 
  Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
  Authentication, access control, and authorization 
  Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
  Cloud computing security 
  Cyber physical systems security 
  Distributed systems security 
  Economics of security and privacy 
  Embedded systems security 
  Formal methods and verification 
  Hardware security 
  Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
  Human-centered security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Machine learning and computer security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Network security and measurement 
  Operating systems security 
  Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
  Program and binary analysis 
  Protocol security 
  Security and privacy metrics 
  Security and privacy policies 
  Security architectures 
  Security for at-risk populations 
  Software supply chain security 
  Systems security 
  User studies for security and privacy 
  Web security and privacy 
  Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
  This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers   
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io  .  
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions   
 Similar to 2024, for each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  
 Accept:  Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2025”. After the symposium, papers will be behind a paywall for one year before they are again made open access. 
  Reject:  Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
  Public Meta-Reviews:  Similar to 2024, all accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review. Authors will be given a draft meta-review at the time of acceptance. Authors will be given the option of addressing some or all of the concerns within one review cycle. A shepherd will remove concerns from the meta-review if they are sufficiently addressed by the revisions.  
   
  The goal of this process is to provide greater transparency and to better scope change requests made by reviewers. More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on the 2024 IEEE S&P website  .  
 Symposium Event (Important Changes)   
 The number of papers accepted to IEEE S&P continues to grow substantially each year. Due to conference venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes, length determined based on the number of accepted papers) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.  
 Important Dates   
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).  
 First deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024 
  Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024 
  Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024 
  Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024 
  Second deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025 
  Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025 
  Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025 
  Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025 
  Rebuttal Period   
 Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive, and is separate from the meta-review rebuttal given to accepted papers. Authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers   
 As with previous IEEE S&P symposia with multiple submission cycles, rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P. Given the move from three submission deadlines in 2024 to two submission deadlines in 2025, rejected papers are eligible to submit according to the table below.  
  
 2024 deadlines | Reject decision  
  Eligible 2025 deadlines 
 First 2024  
  (April 13, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Second 2024  
  (August 3, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Third 2024  
  (Dec 6, 2023) | Second deadline  
  (Nov 14, 2024) 
  
 Instructions for Paper Submission   
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.  
 Anonymous Submission   
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.  
   
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.  
   
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
  The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
  For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.

 Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report  for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.  
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure   
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy  to 90 days https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
   
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
   
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Note  : Submitted papers should not  include full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission.  
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research   
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests   
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is available here  .  
 Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes)   
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.  
   
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” Overleaf template  for an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style.  
   
 Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review. Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template)  . While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \usepackage{usenix}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed.  
 Withdrawing Policy   
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.  
 Authorship Policy   
 Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs approval. If authors anticipate that they might change affiliation during the time the paper is under submission it is recommended to mark both the current and future institution as COI.  
 Conference Submission Server   
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.  
   
 Submission servers  :  
   
 First deadline | : | https://cycle1.sp2025.ieee-security.org/ 
  Second deadline | : | https://cycle2.sp2025.ieee-security.org/ 
  Publication and Presentation   
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA  
 46th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call for Papers   
 Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.  
 Topics of interest include:   
 Applied cryptography 
  Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
  Authentication, access control, and authorization 
  Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
  Cloud computing security 
  Cyber physical systems security 
  Distributed systems security 
  Economics of security and privacy 
  Embedded systems security 
  Formal methods and verification 
  Hardware security 
  Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
  Human-centered security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Machine learning and computer security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Network security and measurement 
  Operating systems security 
  Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
  Program and binary analysis 
  Protocol security 
  Security and privacy metrics 
  Security and privacy policies 
  Security architectures 
  Security for at-risk populations 
  Software supply chain security 
  Systems security 
  User studies for security and privacy 
  Web security and privacy 
  Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
  This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers   
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io  .  
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions   
 Similar to 2024, for each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  
 Accept:  Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2025”. After the symposium, papers will be behind a paywall for one year before they are again made open access. 
  Reject:  Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
  Public Meta-Reviews:  Similar to 2024, all accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review. Authors will be given a draft meta-review at the time of acceptance. Authors will be given the option of addressing some or all of the concerns within one review cycle. A shepherd will remove concerns from the meta-review if they are sufficiently addressed by the revisions.  
   
  The goal of this process is to provide greater transparency and to better scope change requests made by reviewers. More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on the 2024 IEEE S&P website  .  
 Symposium Event (Important Changes)   
 The number of papers accepted to IEEE S&P continues to grow substantially each year. Due to conference venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes, length determined based on the number of accepted papers) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.  
 Important Dates   
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).  
 First deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024 
  Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024 
  Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024 
  Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024 
  Second deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025 
  Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025 
  Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025 
  Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025 
  Rebuttal Period   
 Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive, and is separate from the meta-review rebuttal given to accepted papers. Authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers   
 As with previous IEEE S&P symposia with multiple submission cycles, rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P. Given the move from three submission deadlines in 2024 to two submission deadlines in 2025, rejected papers are eligible to submit according to the table below.  
  
 2024 deadlines | Reject decision  
  Eligible 2025 deadlines 
 First 2024  
  (April 13, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Second 2024  
  (August 3, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Third 2024  
  (Dec 6, 2023) | Second deadline  
  (Nov 14, 2024) 
  
 Instructions for Paper Submission   
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.  
 Anonymous Submission   
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.  
   
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.  
   
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
  The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
  For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Research Ethics Committee   
 Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report  for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.  
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure   
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy  to 90 days https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
   
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
   
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Note  : Submitted papers should not  include full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission.  
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research   
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests   
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is available here  .  
 Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes)   
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.  
   
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” Overleaf template  for an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style.  
   
 Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review. Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template)  . While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \usepackage{usenix}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed.  
 Withdrawing Policy   
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.  
 Authorship Policy   
 Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs approval. If authors anticipate that they might change affiliation during the time the paper is under submission it is recommended to mark both the current and future institution as COI.  
 Conference Submission Server   
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.

  Technical Committee 

 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA  
 46th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call for Papers   
 Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.  
 Topics of interest include:   
 Applied cryptography 
  Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
  Authentication, access control, and authorization 
  Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
  Cloud computing security 
  Cyber physical systems security 
  Distributed systems security 
  Economics of security and privacy 
  Embedded systems security 
  Formal methods and verification 
  Hardware security 
  Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
  Human-centered security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Machine learning and computer security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Network security and measurement 
  Operating systems security 
  Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
  Program and binary analysis 
  Protocol security 
  Security and privacy metrics 
  Security and privacy policies 
  Security architectures 
  Security for at-risk populations 
  Software supply chain security 
  Systems security 
  User studies for security and privacy 
  Web security and privacy 
  Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
  This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers   
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io  .  
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions   
 Similar to 2024, for each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  
 Accept:  Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2025”. After the symposium, papers will be behind a paywall for one year before they are again made open access. 
  Reject:  Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
  Public Meta-Reviews:  Similar to 2024, all accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review. Authors will be given a draft meta-review at the time of acceptance. Authors will be given the option of addressing some or all of the concerns within one review cycle. A shepherd will remove concerns from the meta-review if they are sufficiently addressed by the revisions.  
   
  The goal of this process is to provide greater transparency and to better scope change requests made by reviewers. More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on the 2024 IEEE S&P website  .  
 Symposium Event (Important Changes)   
 The number of papers accepted to IEEE S&P continues to grow substantially each year. Due to conference venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes, length determined based on the number of accepted papers) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.  
 Important Dates   
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).  
 First deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024 
  Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024 
  Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024 
  Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024 
  Second deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025 
  Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025 
  Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025 
  Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025 
  Rebuttal Period   
 Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive, and is separate from the meta-review rebuttal given to accepted papers. Authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers   
 As with previous IEEE S&P symposia with multiple submission cycles, rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P. Given the move from three submission deadlines in 2024 to two submission deadlines in 2025, rejected papers are eligible to submit according to the table below.  
  
 2024 deadlines | Reject decision  
  Eligible 2025 deadlines 
 First 2024  
  (April 13, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Second 2024  
  (August 3, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Third 2024  
  (Dec 6, 2023) | Second deadline  
  (Nov 14, 2024) 
  
 Instructions for Paper Submission   
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.  
 Anonymous Submission   
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.  
   
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.  
   
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
  The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
  For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Research Ethics Committee   
 Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report  for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.  
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure   
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy  to 90 days https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
   
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
   
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Note  : Submitted papers should not  include full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission.  
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research   
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests   
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is available here  .  
 Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes)   
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.  
   
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” Overleaf template  for an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style.  
   
 Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review. Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template)  . While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \usepackage{usenix}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed.  
 Withdrawing Policy   
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.  
 Authorship Policy   
 Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs approval. If authors anticipate that they might change affiliation during the time the paper is under submission it is recommended to mark both the current and future institution as COI.  
 Conference Submission Server   
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.

 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA  
 46th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call for Workshops  
  Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP) has been the premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field. To expand opportunities for scientific exchanges, the IEEE CS Technical Committee on Security and Privacy created the Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW). The typical purpose of such a workshop is to cover a specific aspect of security and privacy in more detail, making it easy for the participants to attend IEEE SP and a specialized workshop at SPW with just one trip. Furthermore, the co-location offers synergies for the organizers. The number of workshops and attendees has grown steadily in recent years. Workshops can be annual events, one-time events, or periodic.  
 The 2025 Security and Privacy Workshops will be held on Thursday, May 15, 2025. All workshops will occur on that day. Up to seven workshops will be hosted by SPW.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12)  .  
  
 Workshop proposals due | September 26, 2024 
 Acceptance notification | October 26, 2024 
 Workshop date | May 15, 2025 
  
 Submission Details  
 Submit your proposal (a single PDF file) at  
  Submit your proposal   
 Please direct questions to sp25-workshopchair@ieee-security.org  .  
 Proposal Requirements  
 There will be some interaction in deciding upon and setting up a workshop, but the initial proposal should already contain a considerable amount of information. A workshop proposal template  is available online at the IEEE S&P “Call for Workshops” website providing instructions and a more detailed description of information to include in proposals:  
 Workshop organizers 
  Workshop length 
  Technical proposal 
  Topics to be addressed 
  Importance of these topics 
  Preliminary call for papers/posters/contributions 
  Preliminary program committee 
  Proposed review process 
  Expected number of participants 
  Publication policy 
  Workshop planning schedule 
  Publicity plan 
  Special meeting logistics requirements 
  Workshop track record 
  Support to Workshop Organizers  
 All workshops associated with the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy will be under the financial and legal responsibility of the IEEE Computer Society. This has great advantages for organizers, e.g., with respect to risk coverage and insurance, but also entails some responsibilities and constraints. The SPW organizers can help you with the following: meeting rooms at the conference hotel, meeting logistics (A/V, meals, etc.), registration, awards production, publishing proceedings with IEEE conference publication services (via IEEEXplore), and workshop publicity complimentary with IEEE S&P publicity efforts. Workshops will be advertised through, and workshop websites can be hosted at, ieee-security.org. The SPW committee will also help with publicity via mechanisms available to the IEEE Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, like the Cipher newsletter, and email lists of past attendees (those with opt-in).  
 Responsibilities of Workshop Organizers  
 Workshop organizers have responsibility for maintaining their workshop website; publicity for their workshop; soliciting, reviewing, and accepting papers; constructing the final program; and all interactions with authors, speakers, etc. Reviewing should be done in accordance with IEEE guidelines (3 reviews per paper, avoid conflict of interest (COI), program chair must review all comments before they are sent back to authors, etc.). If you are interested, we will send you a more detailed list of the responsibilities, meeting room configuration options, template schedule for sessions, etc., and would hope to jointly set up a successful workshop. We encourage workshop organizers to seek their own sponsor funding for their needs (e.g., support invited keynote speakers or panelists) but this is not required. However, workshop organizers must check with the main conference’s Donation Chairs before approaching the sponsors.  
 Workshop Evaluation Criteria  
 The purpose of SPW is to complement IEEE S&P and provide an environment conducive to new ideas and discussion. The criteria for evaluation are intended to assess workshop proposals in this context by considering the following:  
 Organizational details: Is the workshop CFP clear, sensible, and thorough? 
  Suitability for SPW by topic 
  Suitability for IEEE S&P attendees: Would a conference attendee want to attend the workshop? 
  Technical merit 
  Conflict or overlap with existing workshops, both those hosted with SPW and others in the community 
  Likelihood of workshop success 
  Preliminary call for participation: Is it clear about the workshop’s purpose? 
  Proposal quality 
  Anticipated attendance: Workshops should have between 30 and 50 attendees 
  Organizing committee: One or more of the organizers should have experience in organizing successful technical events

 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA  
 46th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call for Papers   
 Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.  
 Topics of interest include:   
 Applied cryptography 
  Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
  Authentication, access control, and authorization 
  Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
  Cloud computing security 
  Cyber physical systems security 
  Distributed systems security 
  Economics of security and privacy 
  Embedded systems security 
  Formal methods and verification 
  Hardware security 
  Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
  Human-centered security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Machine learning and computer security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Network security and measurement 
  Operating systems security 
  Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
  Program and binary analysis 
  Protocol security 
  Security and privacy metrics 
  Security and privacy policies 
  Security architectures 
  Security for at-risk populations 
  Software supply chain security 
  Systems security 
  User studies for security and privacy 
  Web security and privacy 
  Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
  This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers   
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io  .  
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions   
 Similar to 2024, for each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  
 Accept:  Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2025”. After the symposium, papers will be behind a paywall for one year before they are again made open access. 
  Reject:  Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
  Public Meta-Reviews:  Similar to 2024, all accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review. Authors will be given a draft meta-review at the time of acceptance. Authors will be given the option of addressing some or all of the concerns within one review cycle. A shepherd will remove concerns from the meta-review if they are sufficiently addressed by the revisions.  
   
  The goal of this process is to provide greater transparency and to better scope change requests made by reviewers. More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on the 2024 IEEE S&P website  .  
 Symposium Event (Important Changes)   
 The number of papers accepted to IEEE S&P continues to grow substantially each year. Due to conference venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes, length determined based on the number of accepted papers) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.  
 Important Dates   
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).  
 First deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024 
  Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024 
  Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024 
  Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024 
  Second deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025 
  Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025 
  Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025 
  Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025 
  Rebuttal Period   
 Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive, and is separate from the meta-review rebuttal given to accepted papers. Authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers   
 As with previous IEEE S&P symposia with multiple submission cycles, rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P. Given the move from three submission deadlines in 2024 to two submission deadlines in 2025, rejected papers are eligible to submit according to the table below.  
  
 2024 deadlines | Reject decision  
  Eligible 2025 deadlines 
 First 2024  
  (April 13, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Second 2024  
  (August 3, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Third 2024  
  (Dec 6, 2023) | Second deadline  
  (Nov 14, 2024) 
  
 Instructions for Paper Submission   
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.  
 Anonymous Submission   
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.  
   
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.  
   
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
  The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
  For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Research Ethics Committee   
 Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report  for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.  
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure   
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy  to 90 days https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
   
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
   
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Note  : Submitted papers should not  include full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission.  
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research   
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests   
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is available here  .  
 Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes)   
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.  
   
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” Overleaf template  for an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style.  
   
 Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review. Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template)  . While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \usepackage{usenix}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed.  
 Withdrawing Policy   
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.  
 Authorship Policy   
 Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs approval. If authors anticipate that they might change affiliation during the time the paper is under submission it is recommended to mark both the current and future institution as COI.  
 Conference Submission Server   
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.

 Overview  
 The 2024 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security, and privacy. The program will feature:  
 Technical papers, including replication papers and systematization of knowledge papers 
  Workshops and tutorials 
  A poster session 
  Lightning talks 
  Technical Papers  
 We invite authors to submit previously unpublished papers describing research or experience in all areas of usable privacy and security. We welcome a variety of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Papers will be judged on their scientific quality, overall quality, and contribution to the field. Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
  Field studies of security or privacy technology 
  Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features 
  Security testing of new or existing usability features 
  Longitudinal studies of deployed security or privacy features 
  Studies of administrators or developers and support for security and privacy 
  Organizational policy or procurement decisions and their impact on security and privacy 
  Lessons learned from the deployment and use of usable privacy and security features 
  Foundational principles of usable security or privacy 
  Ethical, psychological, sociological, or anthropological aspects of usable security and privacy 
  Usable security and privacy implications/solutions for specific domains (e.g., IoT, medical, vulnerable populations) 
  Replicating or extending important previously published studies and experiments 
  Systematization of knowledge papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area 
  Paper Registration:  Technical papers must be registered by February 8, 2024  . Registration is mandatory for all papers. Registering a paper in the submission system requires filling out all the fields of the online form that describe the submission, but does not require uploading a PDF of the paper. This information must describe the paper accurately, in sufficient detail to assign appropriate reviewers. Placeholder, incomplete, or inaccurate titles and abstracts may result in rejection without review.   
 Paper Submission:  Technical papers must be uploaded as PDFs by February 15, 2024  (but note the mandatory February 8 registration deadline above). All submissions must follow the guidelines described below. Submissions that violate any of the requirements below may be rejected without review.   
 Contact the program chairs prior to submission at soups24chairs@usenix.org  if you have any questions about these requirements.  
 Format and Page Limits:  Papers must use the SOUPS formatting template (available for MS Word  or LaTeX  ) and be submitted as a PDF via the web submission system  . Submissions must be no more than 12 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices). For the body of your paper, brevity is appreciated, as evidenced by the fact that many published papers in prior years have been well under this limit.   
 Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material. We encourage authors to use the appendices for content that is peripheral to the main contributions of the paper but that may interest some readers or that may facilitate replication. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers have an official limit of 12 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices) and 20 pages total including references and appendices. The program committee chairs will grant any extension they determine reasonable to accommodate references and supplemental material.  
 Paper Content:  Papers need to describe the purpose and goals of the work, cite related work, show how the work effectively integrates usability or human factors with security or privacy, and clearly indicate the innovative aspects of the work or lessons learned as well as the contribution of the work to the field. The paper abstracts should contain a sentence summarizing the contribution to the field and literature.  
 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 Your paper and research approach—including research instruments—should be inclusive and respectful. A variety  of guidance  exists  on this topic. Please be sure to follow guidance on language use from the USENIX statement on racism and Black, African-American, and African Diaspora inclusion  .  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers:  We are soliciting Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area of usable security or privacy. SoK papers should draw on prior work to put forth a new taxonomy, argument, or observation in an area in which substantial work has already been done. SoK papers should be more than a survey or summary of prior work in an area. SoK papers will be held to the same scientific and presentation standards as other technical papers. Please prefix the title of these papers with “SoK:” and check the SoK checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process.  
 Replication Papers:  In addition to original work, we are soliciting well-executed replication studies that meaningfully confirm, question, or clarify the result under consideration. Please prefix the title of these papers with the word “Replication:” for the review process.  
 Replication papers should aim to replicate important/influential findings from the literature. They may not necessarily offer new or unexpected findings; papers confirming previous findings are also considered contributions. Replication of a result that has already been replicated many times is less valuable. Replication of an obscure study that originally had only minimal influence on the community is less valuable. Authors should clearly state why they conducted a replication study, describe the methodological differences precisely, and compare their findings with the results from the original study.  
 Replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as other technical papers. They should use currently accepted methodologies and technologies. Authors should not reuse outdated methods/technologies simply because they were used in the original paper. Replications may follow the same protocol as the original study, or may vary one or more key variables to see whether the result is extensible (e.g., re-running a study with a sample from a different population).  
 Anonymous Submission:  Reviewing is anonymous. No names or affiliations should appear on the title page or in the body of the paper, acknowledgments should be removed, and papers should avoid revealing the authors' identities in the text (e.g., don't name a specific organization's ethics review board or similar) or in the PDF metadata. Any references to the authors' own work should be made in the third person, as if it was work by someone else.  Appendices and figures should also be de-identified (e.g., do not leave logos or contact info on study materials, and remove identifying URLs from screenshots). Please ensure all author names, affiliations, URLs, etc. have been removed; even minor mistakes may result in rejection without review. Contact the program chairs at soups24chairs@usenix.org  if you have any questions.  
 Overlap with Previous Papers:  USENIX policy  prohibits simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism. SOUPS further prohibits the submission of substantially similar work to multiple venues. On the recommendation of a program chair, USENIX may take action against authors who have committed these practices. Any overlap between your submitted paper and other work either under submission, previously published, or submitted elsewhere before the SOUPS notification deadline must be documented in an explanatory note sent to the chairs. If a subsequent overlapping submission is made during the review process, the chairs should be notified. State precisely how the two works differ in their goals, share experiments or data sources, and offer unique contributions. If the other work is under submission elsewhere, the program committee may ask to review that work to evaluate the overlap. Please note that program committees frequently share information about papers under review and reviewers usually work on multiple conferences simultaneously. Technical reports, e.g., arXiv reports, are exempt from this rule. If in doubt, please contact the program chairs at soups24chairs@usenix.org  for advice.  
 Self-plagiarism includes verbatim or near-verbatim use of one's own published work without citing the original source, and is generally not acceptable. In some cases, it may be acceptable to include a brief  portion of selected content from the introduction, background, related work, or methods of a closely related paper. In these cases, the original paper must be explicitly referenced and the overlap should be clear to the reader. The reused content must not be part of the main contributions of the paper and, where possible, rewriting the text is preferred. Papers with significant text reuse may be rejected because of too much overlap. If in doubt, please contact the program chairs at soups24chairs@usenix.org  for advice.  
 Appendices:  Authors may attach to their paper supplementary appendices containing study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise fit within the body of the paper. These appendices may also include any material that could assist reviewers with questions that fall outside the stated contribution of your paper on which your work is to be evaluated. Appendices can include links (e.g. to a working prototype or source code repository or data repository); please include full links (not shortened ones), and try to use long-term archives like osf.io or Dataverse for online appendices. Reviewers are not required to read any appendices, so your paper should be self contained without them. We note that in recent years, inclusion of study materials as appendices has become very common, and reviewers may choose to refer to appendices for clarification or confirmation. Accepted papers will be published online with their supplementary appendices included.  
 Conflicts of Interest:  The submission system will request information about conflicts of interest between the paper's authors and program committee (PC) members, including a brief explanation. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member shared an institutional affiliation with the author in the prior two years. 
  The PC member was the advisor or advisee of the author at any time. 
  The PC member has collaborated or published with the author in the prior two years. 
  The PC member is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds the author's research. 
  The PC member is a close personal friend or relative of the author. 
  We recognize that special circumstances may exist, such as deep personal animosity. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the program chairs at soups24chairs@usenix.org  .  
 Ethical Research:  User studies should follow the basic principles of ethical research, including beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. Studies that rely on crowdworkers can incur additional ethical obligations, including but not limited to paying a fair wage. If images of participants are included in the paper, make sure that these images will not create potential risk for participants and that the informed consent covers potential publication of participant images.  
 All papers, especially those with human subjects studies, are expected to discuss ethical considerations. Risks and benefits of the presented research should be weighed. Methodological decisions should be justified. Authors may be asked to provide additional explanations should questions arise during the review process.  
 If your organization or institution requires formal clearance for research with human subjects, your paper may be rejected if clearance is not obtained. However, such clearance alone does not guarantee acceptance, and the program committee may reject a paper on ethical grounds.  
 Early Rejections:  Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. At this point, papers are no longer considered under submission (except if authors appeal).  
 Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the program committee chairs. Authors' appeals must clearly and explicitly identify concrete disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Response:  A response period will occur after the second round of reviews. Authors will be given a chance to see reviews, and they may provide a short response that will be considered in subsequent discussions. Due to time constraints, the response period is fairly short. Please ensure that you reserve enough time between April 18 and 25 for the response process. Late responses will not be accepted.   
 Presentation:  For accepted papers, we require at least one of the paper authors to attend the conference and present the work. However, in exceptional cases, authors of accepted papers may present remotely with permission from the PC Co-Chairs. If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs at soups24chairs@usenix.org  .

 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.

 ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (TOPC), 2021 •  dl.acm.org   
 There has been significant recent interest in parallel graph processing due to the need to  
  quickly analyze the large graphs available today. Many graph codes have been designed  
  for distributed memory or external memory. However, today even the largest publicly-  
  available real-world graph (the Hyperlink Web graph with over 3.5 billion vertices and 128  
  billion edges) can fit in the memory of a single commodity multicore server. Nevertheless,

 There has been significant recent interest in parallel graph processing due to the need to quickly analyze the large graphs available today. Many graph codes have been designed for distributed memory or external memory. However, today even the largest publicly-available real-world graph (the Hyperlink Web graph with over 3.5 billion vertices and 128 billion edges) can fit in the memory of a single commodity multicore server. Nevertheless, most experimental work in the literature report results on much smaller graphs, and the ones for the Hyperlink graph use distributed or external memory. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether we can efficiently solve a broad class of graph problems on this graph in memory.   
 This paper shows that theoretically-efficient parallel graph algorithms can scale to the largest publicly-available graphs using a single machine with a terabyte of RAM, processing them in minutes. We give implementations of theoretically-efficient parallel algorithms for 20 important graph problems. We also present the interfaces, optimizations, and graph processing techniques that we used in our implementations, which were crucial in enabling us to process these large graphs quickly. We show that the running times of our implementations outperform existing state-of-the-art implementations on the largest real-world graphs. For many of the problems that we consider, this is the first time they have been solved on graphs at this scale. We have made the implementations developed in this work publicly-available as the Graph Based Benchmark Suite (GBBS).

 The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of software and system product lines engineering.

 The 29th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2025) will be held at Facultade de Informática, Universidade da Coruña (A Coruña, Spain)  , from September 1st to 5th 2025.  
 The conference will include a highly selective program of research papers and industry papers, accompanied by keynote speeches, workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, panels, and doctoral symposium.

  History 

 About The SPLC  
 The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) provides a forum for practitioners, researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent ideas, innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in systems and software product lines and systems and software product family engineering. Conference events include opportunities to hear industry leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas, and to learn from both.  
 The SPLC is an international collaboration that has resulted from the merger of two former events: SPLC (which started in 2000 in the USA) and Product Family Engineering (PFE, which started in 1996 in Europe). The SPLC steering committee leads three SPLCs: SPLC-Europe (formerly PFE), sponsored by ESI; SPLC-Americas, sponsored by the SEI; and SPLC-Asia, sponsored by the Korea Software Institute.

  Call for Nominations    

 The Software Product Line (SPL)  Conference has established a Most Influential Paper (MIP)  award to recognize significant research contributions to SPLs. Nominations are sought and will be reviewed by the SPLMIP committee. A nominated paper:  
 Must be published at least 10 years ago. 
  The title, author(s), and publication venue (conference, journal) of the paper should be included in a nomination, along with the description of the work (250-500 words in length) and why particular attention to its contributions merits the award. Citations alone are | not | sufficient. Supporting letters from a list of 3 or more endorsers, their names and institutions should be enclosed. An example nomination letter is | below | . 
  A nominated paper could have appeared in any conference or journal venue, not just SPL Conference. 
  If an author of a nominated papers is on the Award Committee, the paper will not be considered until the author(s) rotates off the committee; the nomination is time-stamped by its submission date, not when the nomination becomes active. 
  Nominations are active for up to 4 years upon receipt and would need to be resubmitted upon nomination expiration. 
  We anticipate an MIP Award will be given every year. Award winners will be contacted at least 3 months in advance of the Conference and will be posted/announced in June of that year.  It is also intended that a stipend will be given to the authors of an awarded paper for one or more of them to receive the award and to give a presentation at the conference.  
 Current Nominations.  Set of nominations received to date is he  re.   
 Nominations are now being received.  Nominations should be sent to benavides@us.es  that will forward the nomination to all the members of the committee.  
 All participants, endorses and the Award Committee, will observe ACM’s Guidelines on Conflict of Interest.

   Example Nominating Letter  
 Is approximately one page, providing an overview and reasons for an MIP award. Presumably the letter would be a bit more detailed than the sketch below on impact.  
 We the undersigned nominate the paper “Mass Produced Software Components” by Doug McIlroy, presented at the NATO Software Engineering of 1968. McIlroy’s visionary paper predates software product lines as a research area, but captures the essence of what SPLs have become — the ability to declaratively specify programs from predefined lists of optionally selectable properties or characteristics, many would now call ‘features’.  
   
  The paper itself sketches the foundation of future areas of research: product lines, software components, the software component industry, software reuse, and even parameterized modularity. McIlroy’s work predates Dijkstra’s 1970 work on Structured Programming (where program families was briefly mentioned) and Parna’s “On the design and Development of Program Families” paper of March 1976. It predates Goguen’s early 1980s work that formalized parameterized programming as a foundation for formal models of program variability. Now, all of the previously mentioned pioneers have made fundamental contributions of their own to SPLs, but in McIlroy’s paper we see the outlines of these important future research topics.  
   
  As, further significance, McIlroy’s paper was seminal to Software Reuse Community (circa 1990s), which offered the first regularly-held conference series in which Software Product Lines (although not yet named as such) were routinely explored and the significance of SPLs became widely evident. At the SPLC-2015 conference in Nashville, Linda Northrup, a co-founder of the SPL Conference series, cited work on SPLs in the Reuse Conference that gave birth to SPLC Series.  
   
  The above is a brief summary of our position on this paper. Below we list brief paragraphs that provide individual points of justification of this paper’s significance.  
 Person | XY | — I have cited McIlroy’s work in my research (give citations) for the following reasons… 
  Person | QR | — I have worked in Software component repositories, and McIlroy’s paper inspired my work and that of others by … (give reasons). 
  Person | ST | — McIroy’s paper should be among the “top-reads” in the history of SPL development. 
  Person | ZW | — His paper was cited in the following venues, all of which have contributed (the following…) to the development of SPLs. 
  others 
  Individual confirmation on this joint nomination will be sent, by email, from each of us below.  
   
  Signed,  
   
  XY, Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, Univeristy of Pennsylvania  
  QR, Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Nebraska  
  ST, Program Director, Tata Consultancy  
  ZW, Assistant Professor, School of Computer Sciences, UC Irvine  
   
  Further, from each endorser, there should be a PDF on institution letter head or email coming directly from the endorser, confirming (in 1 sentence) their support from this petition.

 Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues  
 The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment  . Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.  
 For more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/   
 Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.  
 Inclusion  
 Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:  
  
 Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:   
 Implicit assumption: | An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents. 
  Oppressive terminology: | Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in | this article | . 
  Marginalization of URGs: | An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities. 
  Lack of accessibility: | Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple 
  Stereotyping: | Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles. 
   
 Diversity  
 Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.  
 Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:   
 Embracing different cultures: | Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., | this article | on names across different cultures. 
  Embracing differences in figures: | Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people. 
  Embracing gender diversity in pronouns: | Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles. 
   
 Responsibility  
 Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article  discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article  also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.

 SIGMOD 2025 CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS  
 Berlin, Germany, 2025, https://2025.sigmod.org   
 ACM SIGMOD is a leading international forum for data management research. Through the conference, participants will explore cutting edge ideas and results, and exchange techniques, tools and experiences.  
 Major Changes from Prior Years  
 Please make note of the following changes well before you submit your paper:  
 1 Year Wait: | Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed. I.e. a paper rejected at Round 4 of SIGMOD 2024 can only be resubmitted to Round 4 of SIGMOD 2025. A paper rejected at Round 2 can be resubmited to Round 2, 3, and 4 of SIGMOD 2025. 
  ORCIDs: | ORCIDs are required for all authors at the time of abstract submission. See | Submission Guidelines | . 
  Abstract, COIs and Paper Submission Dates: | Abstracts and COIs are submitted a week ahead of the main paper submission on Jan 10, Apr 10, Jul 10 or Oct 10. See | Dates | . 
  No Special Tracks: | Previous data-intensive and data science applications tracks are now folded into the main research track, although they retain unique criteria. See | Topics | . 
  No Author Feedback Phase: | There will be no author feedback phase this year. See | Review Process | . 
  Shepherding in place of Revision Requirements: | Initial feedback from reviews will be an unambiguous Accept or Reject. Accepted papers may have revision requirements from the reviews; a shepherd will assist authors of accepted papers in meeting these requirements. See | Review Process | . 
  Posters and Random Selection for Presentation: | Every accepted paper will be allocated a poster presentation slot. However, due to ever-increasing numbers of accepted papers, there will not be a speaking slot for each accepted paper in 2025. Instead, speaking slots will be allocated via random sampling among accepted papers. See | Presentation | .

 DISSEMINATION  
 The rights of all ACM published authors are detailed at: https://authors.acm.org/author-services/author-rights   
 All accepted papers will also appear in a timely manner in an archival journal: Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD) at https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod  .  
 PRESENTATION  
 Authors of accepted publications will be assigned a time to present a poster of their work at the poster plenaries in the conference. All papers are strongly encouraged to present a poster at these plenaries.  
 The number of SIGMOD submissions has been growing steadily over many years. To accommodate publication growth while maintaining an engaging and communal in-person conference, SIGMOD 2025 will randomly  select a subset of accepted papers for presentation at the conference. Authors of randomly selected papers will be invited to present their paper in a speaking slot at the conference.  
 A random sample of papers ensures a fair selection process, reflects the main themes of the pool of accepted papers, and maintains the principle that all papers regardless of presentation selection are of full SIGMOD quality.  
 REVIEW PROCESS  
 Each submission will receive three  reviews.  
  In response to community feedback, there will be no  author feedback this year. Moreover, unlike past years, all papers will receive an initial Accept or Reject decision upon completion of reviews. In lieu of the revision requests from prior years, many accepted papers will be assigned a shepherd  to guide authors through revisions. Final acceptance is contingent upon satisfying shepherding requests.  
   
 Timeline   
 These are rough timelines that are subject to change.  
 Submission to Notification is 6 weeks

 2 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback 
 3 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback 
 4-8 | Authors revise and resubmit 
 9 | Shepherd, AE, Reviewers make final acceptance/rejection decision 

 Common revision requests can include  
 justify a crucial assumption, 
  improve motivation of the potential benefits of the work, 
  clean up notation, tighten presentation, 
  compare against specific relevant prior work, 
  show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or with richer statistical properties. 
   
 Revision requests must be reasonably achievable in time for resubmission, and will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original.  
 One extra content page is allowed to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.  
 In addition to the revised submission and cover letter, authors are encouraged to include a visual diff of the original and revised versions (e.g. via latexdiff or word processing tools that Track Changes).

 Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)   
   
 Each author | is responsible for entering their | ORCID | , own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT. You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID: the one used at submission will be used for publication. 
  An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions. 
  Conflicts are | not | declared per submission. 
  Conflict declaration must occur prior to paper submission. 
   
 It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.  
 Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Definition of Conflict of Interest   
  A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past five years. | 1 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past five years. | 2 
  The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
   
 1  Short-term associations, such as summer internships do not constitute institutional COIs. E.g., a student who interned at Microsoft should declare as conflicts any individuals in the group they worked with and other collaborators on their projects, but they should not declare a domain conflict with microsoft.com.  
 2  Collaborations are indicated by prior co-authorships, shared grant funding, and close research relationships, even if those have not yet resulted in common publications. Publications (typically with a large set of authors) that fall outside the traditional sense of research collaborations (e.g., “The Seattle Report on Database Research”, “ Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Report”, etc.) do not in themselves constitute a COI.  
 To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members may be asked to confirm declared conflicts with submitting authors.  
 Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirement   
  Following the ACM guidelines  a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected — or withdrawn at your request — from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.  
 To enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.  
 Every research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more, presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication (respecting the double anonymity requirement), and clearly indicate which parts of the work appeared in prior publications and which parts are novel to the current submission.  
 Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.   
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   
  As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing   
  We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.  
 Please visit this page for many examples of both exclusionary writing to avoid and inclusive writing that celebrates diversity to consider adopting: https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html  .  
 Authors are further encouraged to follow the tips and guidelines provided at: https://dbdni.github.io/#materials  .  
 Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in writing.  
 Please see https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter  for inclusive alternatives for some of the terms commonly used in the computing profession.  
 Policy on Authorship Requirements   
  We follow the ACM policy on authorship requirements  . Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: "Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work."  
 Anonymity Requirements for all submissions   
  Research track submissions are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.  
 Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in | (Snodgrass 2007) | : authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process. 
  PC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the submission will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following: Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the submission. 
  Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. 
  Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. 
  The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the submission. 
  Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors' names in the submission's associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. 
   
 To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to SIGMOD.  
 You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:  
 In our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, "A Simple Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10.

 The solution is to reference one's past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity:  
 In previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, "A Simple Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, "A More Complicated Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   
 Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.  
 Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.  
 It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.  
 No exceptions will be made to the double anonymity requirement for Research Track papers. If the authors of a submission feel that double anonymity needs to be violated, for example to reveal the identity of a system, they may consider submission to a SIGMOD track that does not impose a double anonymity requirement, such as the Industry Track.  
 Artifacts and Reproducibility   
  SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Please include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For all Research Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:  
 <meta name="robots" content="noindex">   
 We recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within one week from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.  
 In the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case.

 Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues  
 The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment  . Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.  
 For more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/   
 Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.  
 Inclusion  
 Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:  
  
 Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:   
 Implicit assumption: | An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents. 
  Oppressive terminology: | Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in | this article | . 
  Marginalization of URGs: | An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities. 
  Lack of accessibility: | Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple 
  Stereotyping: | Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles. 
   
 Diversity  
 Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.  
 Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:   
 Embracing different cultures: | Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., | this article | on names across different cultures. 
  Embracing differences in figures: | Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people. 
  Embracing gender diversity in pronouns: | Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles. 
   
 Responsibility  
 Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article  discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article  also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.
