 About  ICOCI 2023  
 Life today has changed drastically as a result of Covid-19. Many aspects of life have shifted from the traditional ways to automation using electronic and communication devices. Digitalization is the main keyword emphasized everywhere to keep society resilient and adaptive to disasters. As a result, a digital society emerges, in which people use information and communication technology at home, work, school, and socialize to keep going with the businesses and life.  
 Back in 2009, United Nations promoted “inclusive society”, which was defined by the Expert Group Meeting on Promoting Social Integration, Helsinki (July 2008) as:  
 “ … a society that over-rides differences of race, gender, class, generation, and geography, and ensures inclusion, equality of opportunity as well as capability of all members of the society to determine an agreed set of social institutions that govern social interaction.”   
 As the digital society emerges, the term is extended to the society’s current values and behaviours. Therefore, the United Nations of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and The Pacific ( ESCAP  ) promotes an “inclusive digital society” focusing on making the society e-resilient in recovering from the disaster.  
 From the aspect of computing and informatics, a question arises: What are the features of technology that would enable an inclusive digital society? Specifically, how the major computing fields of study like artificial intelligence, IoT, and cybersecurity would assist in achieving an “inclusive digital society”? Therefore, ICOCI 2023 would like to invite you to discuss this topic and share your thoughts and works. Together, we could nurture an inclusive digital society for the sustainability of our nation and the universe.  
 School of Computing (SOC)  , Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) organises the 9th International Conference on Computing and Informatics 2023 (ICOCI 2023) from 13 to 14 September 2023. ICOCI has continuously been the platform for researchers and practitioners to share the finding of their studies since 2006. The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth events were held in 2006, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021.

 Aims and Objectives  
 The International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC) was founded in 2004. It takes place every year preferably in a developing country. The aim of the colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and government to present research results, and exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals, another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in research and education between participants and their institutions, from developing and industrial countries.  
 Program  
 The main conference normally lasts three days, but is typically enriched with a school and, possibly, tutorials. All should be welcome to the school, but it should be targetted specifically at (local) students and early career researchers, with courses presented by invited speakers before the main conference. The tutorials, if any, should be targeted at the conference participants and can be presented either by international or local invited speakers. In total, the technical programme should cover at least five days. The school itself can run for up to one week.  
 Proceedings  
 The proceedings of the conference are being published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series  .  
 Principles and Procedure  
 When organising an ICTAC edition, the following principles and procedure are followed:  
 The Steering Committee (SC) is responsible for appointing, for each event: | a. The General Chair(s), which is(are) responsible for the logistic and financial success of the event. They are also the main point of contact of the SC regarding any of these matters. We note, however that, the term "General Chair" does not have a universally accepted meaning, and the SC is happy for the General Chairs to adopt any title that best reflects their responsibilities, as explained above, in the community where the event takes place. Some examples of alternative terms are "Organisation Chair" or "Conference Chair". | b. The Programme Chair(s), which is(are) responsible for the success and quality of the event from an academic point of view. This should be done 18 months before the conference. 
  The conference general chairs appoint the local organization team and provide them with guidance concerning local organization and providing support in mobilizing local resources needed for the organization of the conference. The general chairs are primarily responsible for fund raising needed for the organization. They also play a role in ceremonial activities. 
  The program chairs are in charge of the academic activities of the conference, including the organization of the Program Committee (PC) and selecting Keynote Speakers, conducting the process of review and selection of papers, publication of the proceedings, and organization and implementation of the conference program (with help from the general chairs and local organization team). 
  The General and PC chairs, in agreement, decide and invite publicity chairs and workshop chairs if they see necessary. The nomination of a publicity chair is, in particular, strongly recommended. 
  There should be three or four keynote speakers and it is advisable to have about 35 PC members. 
  When drawing up lists of candidates for the PC and keynote speakers, the PC chairs should consult the general chairs, and they can also ask the SC to suggest candidates. 
  The lists of candidates for the PC and keynote speakers are to be communicated to the SC for final comments before invitations are sent. It is advisable to have six to eight candidates for keynote speakers for consideration by the SC. 
  All the above discussions and consultation should be completed, and the first Call for Papers circulated, within about 6 months. 
  It is suggested that PC members are encouraged to submit papers, but the PC chairs and conference chairs should not. 
  When making the conference budget, best efforts should be made to keep the registration fee as low as possible and yet to provide interesting social and cultural activities for the participants to enjoy. 
  The organisation of a special issue in a reputable journal is strongly encouraged. 
  Becoming an Organiser of ICTAC  
 Each conference attracts between 50 and 100 participants from all over the world. Every year, the Steering Committee issues a call for organisation and any group or institution wishing to host this event are invited to send their proposals. The priority is for the event to be located in a developing country. It usually combines a regular three-day scientific conference with related activities such as tutorials over another two-days and a summer school over the previous week. Innovation in the format and content is encouraged.  
 Proposals will be evaluated by the ICTAC Steering Committee.  
 Proposal Format and Submission   
 Proposals should be no more than four pages in length and should contain:  
 • Brief description of why the event is of interest to the proposer.  
 • Vision for the event, including its aims, the expected format and scale.  
 • An estimation of expected attendance, based, for example, on presence of a local community in the area and costs of travel to various parts of the world and local expenses.  
 • A description of the relevant qualifications and experience of the proposers, especially regarding conference organisation logistics.  
 • A description of the facilities that will be available for the event and to support the organisers.  
 • The contact information of the proposed organising committee.  
 The choice of a PC chair will be subject to later discussion with the Steering Committee and should not be part of the proposal.  
 The proposal (in PDF format) - and any inquiries from those who are from a developing country and willing to organising an ICTAC event or interested in helping organising such an event in a developing country - should be sent to Martin.Leucker@isp.uni-luebeck.de  .

 Submission details are below. If you have any questions, please contact the Program Committee at ictdpc2024@gmail.com   
 Background  
 “ICTs” or “Information & Communication Technologies” comprise electronic technologies for information processing and communication, as well as systems, interventions, and platforms built on such technologies and the data generated by them. “Development” refers to a range of activities aimed at improving the lives of people, and includes, but is not restricted to poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, communication, gender equality, better governance, improved infrastructure, improved agricultural practices, environmental conservation, and sustainability. The conference program will reflect the multidisciplinary nature of ICTD research and diverse publishing traditions within this field, with anticipated contributions from disciplines including (but not limited to) anthropology, communication, computer science, economics, electrical engineering, data science, design, geography, human-computer interaction, information systems, political science, public health, sociology, and various methodological approaches. Given the character of the conference, papers must address and appeal to a broad multidisciplinary audience.  
 Call for Full Papers  
 To be considered Full Papers, contributions | should be more than six pages long | (single column ACM template, as specified in the “Submission Instructions” section below). There is no hard page limit, but papers with length incommensurate to contributions will be rejected. Previous papers (if converted to the ACM single-column format) would have run 14-18 pages in length. 
  Accepted papers typically represent a major advance for the field of ICTD and will be presented as oral presentations. 
  Full Papers will be evaluated via double-blind peer review by a multidisciplinary panel of at least three readers, one of whom will come from outside the paper’s disciplinary domain in order to ensure broad readability. Reviewers will have 4 weeks to complete their reviews. 
  Full Papers will be evaluated according to their novel research contribution, methodological soundness, theoretical framing and reference to related work, quality of analysis, quality of writing and presentation, and relevance to a broad audience of researchers. Manuscripts considering novel designs, new technologies, project assessments, policy analyses, impact studies, theoretical contributions, social issues around ICT and development, and so forth will be considered. Well-analysed negative results from which generalizable conclusions can be drawn are also sought. Authors are encouraged to address the diversity of approaches in ICTD research by providing context, implications, and actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners beyond the authors’ primary domains. Full Papers typically present mature work whereas Notes (TBA) are used for presenting preliminary research that is still work-in-progress. 
  All acceptance will be conditional , the final version of the paper will be checked by reviewers before final acceptance. 
  All accepted Full Papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. A subset of the Full Papers will also appear in a special issue of the Information Technologies & International Development journal. 
  Submission Instructions  
 Submission should be done via the link: | https://ictd2024.hotcrp.com/ 
  Only original, unpublished, research papers in English will be considered. 
  Full Papers | must use | the | ACM templates | and reference formatting (LaTex and Word available). Please, note: As described in the page linked above, manuscripts for review should be submitted in a single column format. Manuscripts submitted for review should use the “Submission Template” (Microsoft Word) or “Primary Article Template” (Latex -documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} ) as described at the link. 
  Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review. No author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Only blind the reference itself in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy. 
  Submissions not in the template format, not related to the conference themes, not anonymized, and/or not meeting a minimum bar of academic research writing will be rejected without full review. 
  Upon acceptance, you will receive instructions on how to prepare your paper for publication. 
  For each accepted submission, at least one of the authors will be required to register and present it at ICTD2024. Else, the submission will not be published in the final proceedings. 
  For Full Papers, see the ACM’s | copyright policies and options | . 
  Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model | ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program  and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance  . 
  Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows: | Full details of the new ICPS publishing model: | https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq 
  Full details of the ACM Open program: | https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess 
  Please direct all questions about the new model to icps-info@acm.org  . 
  Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to read and follow the community-defined minimum ethical standards for ICTD research  . These standards are the result of a three-year participatory process to co-define ethical standards in ICTD, and were voted on and adopted at the ICTD conference in Ahmedabad in January 2019. You can also read more about how these standards were created  .  
 In addition, submissions that describe experiments with human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects, or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a paper raises significant ethical concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.

The INTERSCIENCE Institute-of Management and Technology (IIMT) provide conference support. Information and Communication Technology have a profound influence on how modern organizations operate. Information Technology supports various organizations for their decision making. New technologies are constantly emerging, which are enabling applications in various domains and services. Information Technology is no longer a functional area within an organization, but is integral to the functioning of an organization. In the recent time, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is probably the single most important facilitator of the integration process. The strong influence of Information and Communication Technology in shaping the process of globalization, particularly in the productive, commercial and financial spheres, is also widely recognized. Creating economic opportunities and contributing to poverty reduction is another thrust area for the emerging epoch of ICT.   
   
 Like every year, 14th International Conference of Information and Communication Technology (ICTech-2025) shall provide a forum for presentation of new research results and demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information technology and management. The conference aims to bring together developers, users, academicians and researchers in the information technology and business community for sharing and exploring new areas of research and development and to discuss emerging issues facing business organizations in the knowledge economy.

  September 23 - 27, 2024 / Lviv, UKRAINE   
 on ICT in EDUCATION, RESEARCH,  
  and INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS    
 19th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE   

 Dear Colleague,  
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Therefore, we prefer physical assembly for the conference as a most effective mode for scientific exchange and community building.  
 We fully understand, however, that some participants might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is why we allow virtual participation for the attendees, as an exclusion. The speakers, who present accepted contributed papers, are expected to be physically present at the conference.  
 The information about the arrangements and requirements  for the virtual attendees  are provided and updated at https://icteri.org/icteri-2024/hybrid/  .   
 ICTERI Conference Language  is ENGLISH  
 ICTERI  is a peer-reviewed  International Computer Science  conference that brings together academics and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of Information and Communication Technologies and Infrastructures.  
 ICTERI focuses on real world applications  ; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of their results or experience for industry and services, in addition to academic world. Papers describing advanced prototypes  , systems  , tools  and techniques  and general survey  papers indicating future directions  are also encouraged. Both technological  and methodological  submissions are welcome. All papers must describe original work  , not previously published or submitted elsewhere.  
 ICTERI offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of satellite Workshops   that match the scope of the conference.  
 ICTERI also hosts a PhD Symposium   for young researchers who are at the beginning of their career, such as Master  or PhD students  and also young researchers from industry  . It is a venue that provides expert environment for the presentation of the tractable ideas  and early results  of PhD projects or other research aiming at receiving a PhD.  
 ICTERI is also open to those who would like to give interactive presentations  of their research or demonstrations  of their software at the Poster and Demo Track  .  
  Starting from 2023, ICTERI publishes its post-proceedings (Main Conference, Poster, and PhD Symposium tracks) volume with Springer  in their CCIS Series   (pending approval by Springer for 2024). This is an international and highly reputable venue for conference and workshop proceedings. Springer post-proceedings volume contains the papers accepted by the ICTERI Program Committee   and is published shortly after the conference. ICTERI Springer CCIS volumes  are indexed by: DBLP   , EI-Compendex   , Mathematical Reviews   , SCImago   , Scopus   .

 18th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE   

 Dear Colleague,  
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Though we prefer physical assembly for the conference as the most effective mean for scientific exchange and community building, we fully understand that some people might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is the reason for our decision to run ICTERI 2023 in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 The information about the arrangements and requirements  related to the hybrid mode  of the conference are provided and updated at http://icteri.org/icteri-2023/hybrid/    
 ICTERI Conference Language  is ENGLISH  
 ICTERI  is a peer-reviewed  International Computer Science  conference that brings together academics and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of Information and Communication Technologies and Infrastructures.  
 ICTERI focuses on real world applications  ; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of their results or experience for industry and services, in addition to academic world. Papers describing advanced prototypes  , systems  , tools  and techniques  and general survey  papers indicating future directions  are also encouraged. Both technological  and methodological  submissions are welcome. All papers must describe original work  , not previously published or submitted elsewhere.  
 ICTERI offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of satellite Workshops   that match the scope of the conference.  
 ICTERI also hosts a PhD Symposium   for young researchers who are at the beginning of their career, such as Master  or PhD students  and also young researchers from industry  .

 International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR)  
  
 The International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR) is the premier conference of theoretical information retrieval, co-located each year with the SIGIR conference.  
 The Scope of ICTIR   
 ICTIR welcomes submissions that discuss or utilise theoretical aspects of information retrieval, as well as interdisciplinary research that connects information retrieval with other research disciplines that are theoretically motivated. Other research disciplines include, but are not limited to: artificial intelligence, cognitive science, digital humanities, machine learning, natural language processing, recommendation, and social computing.  
 While IR research traditionally relies heavily on rigorous experimentation, ICTIR does not see this as a must. That is, lack of experiments is not considered a weakness in an ICTIR submission. However, if the work is theoretically driven, it should be presented so that it is accessible to a wide audience in the IR community, and the theory should be accompanied by good justifications and arguments.  
 ICTIR does welcome experiment-based papers, but the experimental results are expected to shed some light on the theoretical aspects of IR and related fields.  
 Specific topics that are particularly welcome are decided by the ICTIR PC chairs each year.

 ACM ICTIR 2024   

 The 10th ACM SIGIR / The 14th International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval   
 July 13, 2024 (Washington D.C., USA).   
 Co-located with  ACM SIGIR 2024   (July 14-18, 2024).   

 The International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR) is the premier conference of theoretical information retrieval.   
   See  the following page   for general information about ICTIR.   
  
   ICTIR 2024 will be held on July 13 in Washington D.C. (USA)  and  invites submissions with substantial and original research on the theoretical aspects of information retrieval or topics from neighboring fields with a strong and clear connection to information retrieval.   

 Co-Located with ACM SIGIR 2024    
  
 ICTIR`24 is co-located with  SIGIR`24   , unlike previous years, ICTIR`24 is held one day  before  the  entire  SIGIR`24 program.   
   This means that there is  no overlap  with SIGIR`24, thus attendance to ICTIR`24 does not compete with any of the SIGIR tutorials, workshops or main program.   
 ICTIR'24 takes place in the same venue as SIGIR`24: the Capital Hilton Hotel, see  the following page   for more information.   
 For details about registration see  the following page   .

 introduction  
   
 Digital technology affects the lives of people the world over in many ways. ICT are a key factor not only at the macro level in the process of globalization but also at the micro level where the increased use of mobile phones, for instance, has changed communication patterns all over the world. In order to alleviate and to promote Indian ICT industry, the Government of India had set up a National Task Force on ICT and Software Development to examine the feasibility of strengthening the industry along with providing major fiscal incentives. India aims to transform India into a truly developed and empowered society by 2025. However, to achieve this growth, the sector has to continue to re-invent itself and strive for that extra mile, through new business models, global delivery, partnerships and transformation. In order to recognize and reward the extraordinary performance as well achievements by ICT and allied industries, Communally we are organising 9th Edition of ICT4SD International ICT summit & Awards 2025 on 3  - 5  July, 2025 at Goa, India.

 Introduction  
   
 The International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) is a research conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) held every other year. It is considered to be one of the top conferences in computer vision, alongside CVPR and ECCV, and it is held on years in which ECCV is not. The conference is usually spread over four to five days. Typically, experts in the focus areas give tutorial talks on the first day, then the technical sessions (and poster sessions in parallel) follow. Recent conferences have also had an increasing number of focused workshops and a commercial exhibition.

 International Conference on Computer Vision Systems 2023     /  About ICVS    

 About ICVS  
   
 The 14th International Conference on Computer Vision Systems will be held in Vienna on September 27-29, 2023 continuing a series of successful events beginning in Las Palmas, Spain, in 1999. In the meantime ICVS took place on three continents and in eleven different countries.  
 While most computer vision conferences focus on specific methods for experimental applications, ICVS primarily addresses issues arising in the design and deployment of comprehensive computer vision systems.  
 Its scope includes but is not limited to the following topics:  
 Building Vision Systems: Paradigms, architectures, integration, control 
  Real-time and Mobile Vision: Embedded systems, non-standard hardware, mobile applications 
  Vision for the Real World: Robustness, learning, adaptability, self-assessment, failure recovery 
  Vision for Action: Robotics, perception-action loops 
  Vision in Context: Context awareness, knowledge representations, reasoning, goal specification 
  Biological Vision: computer vision inspired by biology or psychology 
  Human-computer interaction: Monitoring, supervised learning, scene interpretation 
  Performance Evaluation: benchmarks, methods and metrics 
  ICVS brings together researchers and developers from academia and industry around the world. The perspective on systems offers a unique opportunity for sharing competence in application development and for identifying application-driven research questions.

 ACTION   

 Providing embodied agents with sequential decision-making capabilities to safely execute complex tasks in dynamic environments.   
 To make robots autonomous in real-world everyday spaces, they should be able to learn from their interactions within these spaces, how to best execute tasks specified by non-expert users in a safe and reliable way. To do so requires sequential decision-making skills that combine machine learning, adaptive planning and control in uncertain environments as well as solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. Our research combines expertise in reinforcement learning, computer vision, robotic control, sim2real transfer, large multimodal foundation models and neural combinatorial optimization to build AI-based architectures and algorithms to improve robot autonomy and robustness when completing everyday complex tasks in constantly changing environments. More details on our research can be found in the Explore section below.  

 ×    

 INTERACTION   

 Equip robots to interact safely with humans, other robots and systems.  
 For a robot to be useful it must be able to represent its knowledge of the world, share what it learns and interact with other agents, in particular humans. Our research combines expertise in human-robot interaction, natural language processing, speech, information retrieval, data management and low code/no code programming to build AI components that will help next-generation robots perform complex real-world tasks. These components will help robots interact safely with humans and their physical environment, other robots and systems, represent and update their world knowledge and share it with the rest of the fleet. More details on our research can be found in the Explore section below.  

 ×    

 VISION   

 Perception to help robots understand and interact with the environment.   
 Visual perception is a necessary part of any intelligent system that is meant to interact with the world. Robots need to perceive the structure, the objects, and people in their environment to better understand the world and perform the tasks they are assigned. Our research combines expertise in visual representation learning, self-supervised learning and human behaviour understanding to build AI components that help robots understand and navigate in their 3D environment, detect and interact with surrounding objects and people and continuously adapt themselves when deployed in new environments. More details on our research can be found in the Explore section below.

 VISION   
 The research we conduct on expressive visual representations is applicable to visual search, object detection, image classification and the automatic extraction of 3D human poses and shapes that can be used for human behavior understanding and prediction, human-robot interaction or even avatar animation. We also extract 3D information from images that can be used for intelligent robot navigation, augmented reality and the 3D reconstruction of objects, buildings or even entire cities.  
 Our work covers the spectrum from unsupervised to supervised approaches, and from very deep architectures to very compact ones. We’re excited about the promise of big data to bring big performance gains to our algorithms but also passionate about the challenge of working in data-scarce and low-power scenarios.  
 Furthermore, we believe that a modern computer vision system needs to be able to continuously adapt itself to its environment and to improve itself via lifelong learning. Our driving goal is to use our research to deliver embodied intelligence to our users in robotics, autonomous driving, via phone cameras and any other visual means to reach people wherever they may be.

 Making robots safe, robust and useful in our everyday spaces.   
 A multidisciplinary approach to AI across three main research axes.   

 Vision    
 Perception to help robots understand  
  and interact with the environment.  

 Action    
 Enable embodied agents to efficiently execute tasks and to navigate in dynamic environments.  

 Interaction    
 Equip robots to interact safely with humans, other robots and systems.  

 Our main areas of expertise are computer vision (human understanding, human pose estimation, lifelong learning, 3D vision, representation learning…), natural language processing (speech, controlled generation, translation, multimodal neural search…), machine learning for robotics (reinforcement learning, manipulation, navigation, task learning…), machine learning for optimization (data driven optimization, deep learning for combinatorial optimization, stochastic programming…), human-robot interaction and software engineering to integrate AI/ML components with no code/low code. These different areas of expertise focus on one or several of the three AI for Robotics themes (action, interaction and vision).

Our research combines expertise in reinforcement learning, computer vision, robotic control, sim2real transfer, large multimodal foundation models and neural combinatorial optimisation to build AI-based architectures and algorithms to improve robot autonomy and robustness when completing everyday complex tasks in constantly changing environments.

 VISION   
 The research we conduct on expressive visual representations is applicable to visual search, object detection, image classification and the automatic extraction of 3D human poses and shapes that can be used for human behavior understanding and prediction, human-robot interaction or even avatar animation. We also extract 3D information from images that can be used for intelligent robot navigation, augmented reality and the 3D reconstruction of objects, buildings or even entire cities.  
 Our work covers the spectrum from unsupervised to supervised approaches, and from very deep architectures to very compact ones. We’re excited about the promise of big data to bring big performance gains to our algorithms but also passionate about the challenge of working in data-scarce and low-power scenarios.  
 Furthermore, we believe that a modern computer vision system needs to be able to continuously adapt itself to its environment and to improve itself via lifelong learning. Our driving goal is to use our research to deliver embodied intelligence to our users in robotics, autonomous driving, via phone cameras and any other visual means to reach people wherever they may be.

  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 All papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE: To be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted workshop paper is required to register for the conference at the “Workshop Registration” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
   
  During the initial paper submission process, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on th paper registration page. In particular, the paper registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 IMPORTANT:  
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.

 Please follow us on Bluesky  to stay updated on the latest news and announcements for ICWSM 2025.  

  The International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) is a forum for researchers from multiple disciplines to come together to share knowledge, discuss ideas, exchange information, and learn about cutting-edge research in diverse fields with the common theme of investigating the interplay of web and society. This overall theme includes research on new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing digital traces of human activities or behaviors in social settings. ICWSM is a singularly fitting venue for research that blends social science and computational approaches to answer important and challenging questions about human social behavior through online traces while advancing computational tools for vast and unstructured data.  
   
  ICWSM, now in its nineteenth year, has become one of the premier venues for computational social science and social computing. Previous years  of ICWSM have featured papers, posters, and demos that draw upon a wide spectrum of disciplines from computational sciences (e.g., network science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, test/data mining natural language processing, image/multimedia processing, human computer interaction) to social sciences (e.g., sociology, communication, political science, anthropology, psychology, economics, digital humanities). Note that papers focusing solely on the advancement of algorithmic components or which use Web data only as an artifact (for instance, in method evaluation) are out of scope. Ideal submissions should speak to research questions of societal relevance.  
   
  We invite original work that utilizes diverse digitally mediated data sources such as web navigation traces, traces from apps, social media traces, data from online platforms such as microblogs (e.g., X/ formerly Twitter), wiki-based knowledge sharing sites (e.g., Wikipedia), online news media (e.g., Huffington Post), forums, mailing lists, newsgroups community media sites (e.g., YouTube, Instagram), Q&A sites (e.g., Quora Stack Overflow), user review sites (e.g., Yelp, Amazon.com), search platforms and social curation sites (e.g., Reddit, Pinterest). Adapting to our continuously evolving field, we are open to new forms of technologically mediated human or society-related data sources (e.g., mobility traces, satellite data) and methods that advance our understanding of society and the influence of the web on it.  
   
  The uniqueness of the venue and the quality of submissions have contributed to a rapidly growing conference, and a competitive acceptance rate of approximately 20 to 30% for full-length research papers published in the proceedings by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)  .  
   
  ICWSM-2025 will be held from June 23 - 26, 2025, in Copenhagen, Denmark.  
   
  Topics include (but are not limited to): Analysis of the relationship between social media and mainstream media 
  Qualitative and quantitative studies of online platforms 
  Subjectivity in textual data; sentiment analysis; polarity/opinion/stance identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of human behavior on the web 
  Information retrieval on online platforms 
  Credibility of online content 
  Measuring predictability of real-world phenomena based on digital trace data, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and health 
  Social network analysis; communities identification; expertise and authority discovery 
  Trust; reputation; recommendation systems 
  Text categorization; topic recognition; demographic/gender/age identification 
  Privacy and security on the web 
  Trend identification and tracking; time series forecasting for web data 
  New web applications; interfaces; interaction techniques 
  Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification on the web 
  Social innovation and effecting change through the web 
  Psychological, personality-based, and ethnographic studies of web-based platforms 
  Studies of digital humanities (culture, history, arts) using online traces 
  Internet usage on mobile devices; location, human mobility, and behavior 
  Organizational and group behavior mediated by web technology; interpersonal communication mediated by web and social media

 Brief Full Paper Submission Information  
 Full Paper Submission Site (new submissions only - not revisions)   
 Register or log in to PCS account to access the above link 
  After registering/logging in, click on the Submissions tab and make the following selections from the dropdown menus: Society: AAAI. Conference/Journal: ICWSM 25. Track: ICWSM 25 January Submissions. 
  After clicking "Go" a placeholder submission will appear in the table below. Click on "Edit Submission" to add your paper details. 
  The submission will be marked complete when you have entered all the required fields, but you will still be able to make edits until submissions are closed. 
  The 2025 reviewing process will be similar to that of the 2024 process. The new, required  Paper Checklist  section introduced in 2024 will be continued this year and all papers accepted to ICWSM-2025 will be required to have this section. Papers to be considered for publication in the ICWSM proceedings, and presentation at the ICWSM-2025 conference, must be submitted by one of the remaining submission deadlines listed above. See also the Paper Checklist as PDF here.   
 Authors who receive the "Accept" recommendation will have the opportunity to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors who receive the "Revise and Resubmit" recommendation will have the opportunity to address reviewer suggestions and resubmit an improved manuscript in the next submission deadline.  
 Papers accepted no later than March 2025, will be presented at the ICWSM-2025 conference and will be published in the corresponding conference proceedings. Authors who receive "Revise and Resubmit" in March 2025 will likely be presenting during the 2026 conference if their papers get accepted during the next submission round in May 2025.  
 See the complete submission guidelines  below for more information.  
 Full Formatting Guidelines for Paper Submission  
 Content Guidelines   
 Format   : All papers must be submitted as high-resolution PDF files, formatted in AAAI two-column camera-ready style, for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts (available templates:  AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or  AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  ).  . Full papers are recommended to be 8 pages long, and must be at most 11 pages long, including only the main text and the references. The mandatory Ethics Checklist (and brief additional Ethics Statement, if desired, see below), optional appendices, etc. do not count toward the page limit and should be placed after the references. Appendices, if they exist, should be placed after the Ethics Checklist.  Revision papers and final camera-ready full papers can be up to 12 pages. No source files (Word or LaTeX) are required at the time of submission for review; only the PDF file is permitted. Finally, the copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase, and no copyright form is required until a paper is accepted for publication.  
 Language   : All submission must be in English.   
 Anonymity   : ICWSM-2025 review is double-blind. Therefore, please anonymize your submission: do not put the author names or affiliations at the start of the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review. References to authors' own prior relevant work should be included, but should not specify that this is the authors' own work. It is up to the authors' discretion how much to further modify the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers on the Web. Even in cases where the author's identity is known to a reviewer, the double-blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard to authors' reputation. Note that 2-page demo submissions and the dataset paper submissions, and only these, are exempt from the anonymization requirement as they often contain system URLs or URLs to data sharing services.   
 Revisions   : Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a "Revise and Resubmit " decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author's response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.   
 REQUIRED  Ethics Guidelines:   In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a new  checklist that describes the potential broader impact of their work and ethical considerations. Drawing on feedback from the 2023 ICWSM Town Hall and approaches used in other conferences, the 2024 ICWSM Program Committee Chairs have developed this checklist-based approach for the Ethics section of ICWSM papers submitted for the cycle 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. All papers should communicate the known or anticipated consequences of research via the paper checklist available as an Overleaf document   , and a PDF format   .  This completed and unaltered (i.e. no questions removed) checklist should come as the first section after the references of the paper. Authors may supplement this Paper Checklist (in the same section of the paper) with a brief discussion that expands on answers to the checklist where it is necessary to do so. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit, and that papers without such a statement will be desk-rejected.    
 Disclosure of funding and competing interests:   Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest, in a section (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) that should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers, but not in the version submitted for review (in order to maintain author anonymity). Furthermore, authors are required to read the  AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines   ; submitting to ICWSM implies that the authors agree to abide by these rules.  
 Resubmission:   Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the January round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.   
 Policy on Authorship:   ICWSM'25 will adopt the following subsection of ACM's new policy on authorship  , restated here: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the Acknowledgements section of the Work. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work.   
   
 Duplicate Submissions  : ICWSM-2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to submissions for non-archival workshops.  While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal. If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process then:   
 All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference 
  And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year. 
  Conference Registration  : Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s conference will open soon. Stay tuned!   
 Publication  : All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the 'social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)'; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate authors in addressing comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.   
 Datasets  : ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.

 Deadline:  Sun January 19th, 2025 11:59 PM Anywhere on Earth  
  Notifications:  Mon February 3rd, 2025   
 The ICWSM-2025 Committee invites proposals for Workshops Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM-2025). The Workshops Day will be held on June 23rd, 2025. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected focus -- providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers and developers from a wide range of disciplines, including social science and computer science. Workshops are an excellent forum for exploring emerging approaches and task areas bridging gaps between the social sciences and computing, and elucidating the results of exploratory research.   
 Members of the social media research community are encouraged to submit proposals. To foster interaction and exchange of ideas, the workshops will be kept small, with up to 40 participants.   
 The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. The two main criteria for the selection of the workshops will be the following:   
 The organizers encourage workshops that promote different types of activities, including challenges, games, brainstorming, and networking sessions. The organizers discourage workshops that are structured as mini-conferences dominated by long talks and short discussions. Workshops should leave ample time for discussions and interaction between the participants and should also encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. 
  The workshop should have the potential to attract the interest of researchers in computer science and social science. Proposals involving people of different backgrounds in the organizing committee and addressing topics at the intersection of different disciplines will have a higher chance of acceptance. 
  Workshop organizers who want to publish the papers from their workshop (or significant portions of it) will have the opportunity to do so through workshop proceedings by the AAAI Press. For a list of last year's workshops see here  .   
 Workshop Proposal Contents   
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than five (5) pages in length (10pt, single column with reasonable margins), written in English, and should contain the following:   
 A concise title. 
  The names, affiliations, and contact information of the organizing committee. A main contact author should be specified. 
  An indication as to whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day meeting. 
  A short abstract describing the scope and main objective of the workshop. Identify the specific issues and research questions the workshop will focus on, with a brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time and for which research communities. 
  A two/three paragraph description of the workshop topic and themes. 
  A description of the proposed workshop format and a detailed list of proposed activities with special emphasis on those activities that distinguish it from a mini-conference (e.g., games brainstorming sessions, challenges, group activities). 
  An approximate timeline of the activities. 
  A description of how workshop submissions will be evaluated and selected (invited contributions, peer review: single/double blind, etc.). In case a PC is needed, provide a tentative list of the members. 
  Historical information about the workshop, if available. Short description of the previous editions reporting highlights and details about the approximate number of attendees and number of submissions. 
  A list of other related workshops held previously at related conferences, if any (list does not have to be exhaustive), together with a brief statement on how the proposed workshop differs from or how it follows-up on work presented at previous workshops. 
  A short bio for each member of the organizing committee, including a description of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. 
  A brief statement on whether any generative AI tools were used to generate ideas for the workshop or the workshop activities. Workshop organizers strongly discourage the use of generative AI to come up with workshop ideas and activities. 
  Please use the AAAI Author Kit  to format your submission. Your proposal should be emailed in a single file to the workshop chairs (Luca Rossi, Shruti Phadke, and Akhil Arora) at workshops@icwsm.org  before the deadline. For additional information please contact the workshop chairs at the same address.   

 ICWSM-2025 invites proposals for Tutorials Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). ICWSM-2025 is seeking proposals for tutorials on topics related to the computational analysis and understanding of social phenomena in the following formats:   
 Lecture-style:   Traditional tutorials to teach concepts, methodologies, tools, and software packages. Tutorials on novel and fast growing directions and significant applications are highly encouraged. The conference is paying particular attention to themes around new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing new forms of social media. Lecture-style tutorials on these themes are highly encouraged.   
 Hands-on:   Interactive, in-depth, hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools (with a proven track record in the community), targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users, with a focus on providing an engaging experience. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably.   
 Translation:   Tutorials that aim to translate concepts between disciplines. For example, such a tutorial could introduce social science concepts to computer scientists, or computational concepts to social scientists. Thus these tutorials should be geared towards a beginner audience.   
 Case study:   Focused tutorials that emphasize real world applications of ICWSM work. These tutorials should walk the audience through how research insights and tools were applied in practice. We welcome submissions from practitioners in industry, government, and NGOs in addition to academics.   
 Free-style:   We also welcome proposals for creative and unconventional training sessions, such as hackathons competitions/challenges, etc., as long as participants can learn practical skills and participate in an active way.   
 We welcome tutorials of various lengths (1, 2, 4, or up to 8 hours). We are looking for contributions from experts in both the social and computational sciences, in industry, academia, and beyond. For a list of tutorials from previous years, we encourage you to visit the tutorials page for 2018  , 2019  , 2020  , 2021  , 2022  , 2023  , and 2024  . We especially encourage applications from first-time proposers and scholars with   
 Acceptance Criteria   
 The format will be entirely determined by the tutorial organizers—i.e., you! Proposals will be selected for inclusion considering the following criteria:   
 Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to ICWSM attendees and research communities. 
  Cross-pollination potential. Tutorials that attract an interdisciplinary audience will be given preference. The proposals should highlight, when applicable, the tutorial's potential to transfer knowledge from one discipline/area to another. 
  Interactivity. We will favor tutorials that aim to include hands-on experiences collaborative approaches, and interactivity. 
  Completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and materials, including the schedule of the tutorial. 
  Expertise of the presenters. 
  Proposals of tutorials presented at past events are allowed, although novelty is a plus. The tutorial chairs may also reach out to potential tutorial presenters about a change in format length depending on expected increased interest or capacity constraints.   
 Tutorial Proposal Content and Format   
 Proposals for tutorials should be no more than three (3) pages in length. Proposal submissions should include the following information:   
 Title.  A concise title. 
  Abstract.  A short description (200 words) of the main objective of the tutorial, to be published on the main ICWSM website. 
  Type.  The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation case study, or free-style. 
  Names, affiliations, emails, and personal websites of the tutorial organizers.  A main contact author should be specified. A typical proposal should include no more than three presenters (more people can be involved in the organization). 
  Duration.  A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event. 
  Tutorial schedule and activities.  A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them. 
  Target audience, prerequisites and outcomes.  A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial. 
  Materials.  The organizers of accepted tutorials will be required to set up a web page containing all the information for the tutorial attendees before the tutorial day (roughly 2 weeks before the tutorial day). The proposal should contain the list of materials that will be made available on the website. 
  Past precedent  (when available). A list of other tutorials held previously at related conferences, if any, together with a brief statement on how the proposed tutorial relates to previous events. If the authors of the proposal have organized other tutorials in the past, pointers to the relevant material (e.g., slides, videos, web pages, code) should be provided. 
  Additional info for hands-on tutorials:    
 Operating system and required installed tools on attendees' devices. 
  List of software licenses required for the tools. 
  Setup instructions for attendees. (The setup should not take more than 1 hour to complete.) 
  Please use the AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  to format your submission. If you have questions on any of the submission requirements or for presubmission feedback/questions, please reach out to the tutorial chairs (Tunazzina Islam, Pablo Aragón, and Shadi Rezapour) at the address tutorials@icwsm.org  .   

 ICWSM 2025 will offer a new and experimental mentoring scheme for first-time ICWSM authors. Interested authors can submit a complete manuscript by August 1, 2024, 23:59 AoE. Qualifying manuscripts will receive written feedback from a Senior PC member by August 22 on how their manuscript can be improved. We hope that authors can incorporate the feedback and submit an improved manuscript in the regular ICWSM submission cycle  by September 15, 2024.  
 This scheme’s goal is to support young scholars, in particular in low-and-middle-income countries, and to increase ICWSM’s appeal to scholars in adjacent communities.  
  
  Before submitting your manuscript via a web form  , you will need to confirm that:  
 None of the authors has any prior ICWSM full papers, not counting poster, dataset or workshop papers. 
  Your manuscript is complete (typically 7-11 pages in a two-column format) without any missing sections. 
  You are available to substantially revise your paper between August 22 and September 15. 
  The manuscript presents academic research related to “the Web and social media”, broadly defined. 
   
  We also ask you to check whether the first author’s affiliation country qualifies as a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income economy according to the World Bank classification  . Authors from these countries will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 Similarly, in the submission form, we ask about prior experience with non-full-paper publications, e.g. dataset, poster or workshop publications, and about prior ICWSM attendance. Authors without any ICWSM experience will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 While not required, we suggest you follow the formatting guidelines  for ICWSM 2024 to save the time needed later for reformatting. However please include the author and affiliation information in the manuscript for the mentoring scheme.

 Brief Full Paper Submission Information  
 Full Paper Submission Site (new submissions only - not revisions)   
 Register or log in to PCS account to access the above link 
  After registering/logging in, click on the Submissions tab and make the following selections from the dropdown menus: Society: AAAI. Conference/Journal: ICWSM 25. Track: ICWSM 25 January Submissions. 
  After clicking "Go" a placeholder submission will appear in the table below. Click on "Edit Submission" to add your paper details. 
  The submission will be marked complete when you have entered all the required fields, but you will still be able to make edits until submissions are closed. 
  The 2025 reviewing process will be similar to that of the 2024 process. The new, required  Paper Checklist  section introduced in 2024 will be continued this year and all papers accepted to ICWSM-2025 will be required to have this section. Papers to be considered for publication in the ICWSM proceedings, and presentation at the ICWSM-2025 conference, must be submitted by one of the remaining submission deadlines listed above. See also the Paper Checklist as PDF here.   
 Authors who receive the "Accept" recommendation will have the opportunity to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors who receive the "Revise and Resubmit" recommendation will have the opportunity to address reviewer suggestions and resubmit an improved manuscript in the next submission deadline.  
 Papers accepted no later than March 2025, will be presented at the ICWSM-2025 conference and will be published in the corresponding conference proceedings. Authors who receive "Revise and Resubmit" in March 2025 will likely be presenting during the 2026 conference if their papers get accepted during the next submission round in May 2025.  
 See the complete submission guidelines  below for more information.  
 Full Formatting Guidelines for Paper Submission  
 Content Guidelines   
 Format   : All papers must be submitted as high-resolution PDF files, formatted in AAAI two-column camera-ready style, for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts (available templates:  AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or  AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  ).  . Full papers are recommended to be 8 pages long, and must be at most 11 pages long, including only the main text and the references. The mandatory Ethics Checklist (and brief additional Ethics Statement, if desired, see below), optional appendices, etc. do not count toward the page limit and should be placed after the references. Appendices, if they exist, should be placed after the Ethics Checklist.  Revision papers and final camera-ready full papers can be up to 12 pages. No source files (Word or LaTeX) are required at the time of submission for review; only the PDF file is permitted. Finally, the copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase, and no copyright form is required until a paper is accepted for publication.  
 Language   : All submission must be in English.   
 Anonymity   : ICWSM-2025 review is double-blind. Therefore, please anonymize your submission: do not put the author names or affiliations at the start of the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review. References to authors' own prior relevant work should be included, but should not specify that this is the authors' own work. It is up to the authors' discretion how much to further modify the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers on the Web. Even in cases where the author's identity is known to a reviewer, the double-blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard to authors' reputation. Note that 2-page demo submissions and the dataset paper submissions, and only these, are exempt from the anonymization requirement as they often contain system URLs or URLs to data sharing services.   
 Revisions   : Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a "Revise and Resubmit " decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author's response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.   
 REQUIRED  Ethics Guidelines:   In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a new  checklist that describes the potential broader impact of their work and ethical considerations. Drawing on feedback from the 2023 ICWSM Town Hall and approaches used in other conferences, the 2024 ICWSM Program Committee Chairs have developed this checklist-based approach for the Ethics section of ICWSM papers submitted for the cycle 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. All papers should communicate the known or anticipated consequences of research via the paper checklist available as an Overleaf document   , and a PDF format   .  This completed and unaltered (i.e. no questions removed) checklist should come as the first section after the references of the paper. Authors may supplement this Paper Checklist (in the same section of the paper) with a brief discussion that expands on answers to the checklist where it is necessary to do so. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit, and that papers without such a statement will be desk-rejected.    
 Disclosure of funding and competing interests:   Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest, in a section (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) that should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers, but not in the version submitted for review (in order to maintain author anonymity). Furthermore, authors are required to read the  AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines   ; submitting to ICWSM implies that the authors agree to abide by these rules.  
 Resubmission:   Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the January round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.   
 Policy on Authorship:   ICWSM'25 will adopt the following subsection of ACM's new policy on authorship  , restated here: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the Acknowledgements section of the Work. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work.   
   
 Duplicate Submissions  : ICWSM-2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to submissions for non-archival workshops.  While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal. If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process then:   
 All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference 
  And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year. 
  Conference Registration  : Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s conference will open soon. Stay tuned!   
 Publication  : All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the 'social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)'; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate authors in addressing comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.   
 Datasets  : ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.

Demo descriptions must be no longer than 3 pages (excluding the mandatory ethics checklist), with page 3 containing nothing but references. Both types of submissions must follow the same formatting guidelines as full papers, in particular using a 2-column format. The submission deadline for both posters and demos is January 15, 2025.  
 The reviewing process for posters and demos will follow the same pattern as in previous years. Submissions will either be accepted or rejected. Authors of accepted submissions will be able to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. Poster and demo papers will not have a revise and resubmit phase. Poster and Demo submissions are double-blind, and require the Ethics Checklist described in the guidelines  .  
 Datasets  
 Dataset paper submissions must be between 2-10 pages long, including references but excluding the mandatory "Ethics Checklist" section, and will be part of the full proceedings. Submissions will either be accepted or rejected without an option to revise and resubmit. Authors of accepted submissions will have the opportunity to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. All papers must follow the AAAI formatting guidelines. Please refer to the guidelines for submission  . We also encourage authors to submit a small sample of the dataset (maximum of 10MB, in csv, txt, json, or other readable formats) to aid the reviewers. This should be submitted as supplementary material on the Precision Conference system.  
 The submissions must comprise (i) a dataset or group of datasets, and (ii) a paper describing the content quality, structure, potential uses of the dataset(s), as well as the methodology employed for data collection. Furthermore, descriptive statistics may be included in the metadata; however, more sophisticated analyses should be included in regular paper submissions. The review will be single-blind, and all datasets must be identified and uploaded at the time of submission.  
 Datasets and metadata must be published using a dataset-sharing service (e.g. Zenodo  , datorium  , dataverse  , or any other dataset-sharing service that indexes your dataset and metadata and increase the re-findability of the data) that provides a DOI for the dataset, which must be included in the dataset paper submission.  
 Authors are encouraged to:  
 Include a description of how they intend to make their datasets | FAIR | . 
  Consider addressing the questions covered in the | Datasheets for Datasets | recommendations.

 Deadline:  Sun January 19th, 2025 11:59 PM Anywhere on Earth  
  Notifications:  Mon February 3rd, 2025   
 The ICWSM-2025 Committee invites proposals for Workshops Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM-2025). The Workshops Day will be held on June 23rd, 2025. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected focus -- providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers and developers from a wide range of disciplines, including social science and computer science. Workshops are an excellent forum for exploring emerging approaches and task areas bridging gaps between the social sciences and computing, and elucidating the results of exploratory research.   
 Members of the social media research community are encouraged to submit proposals. To foster interaction and exchange of ideas, the workshops will be kept small, with up to 40 participants.   
 The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. The two main criteria for the selection of the workshops will be the following:   
 The organizers encourage workshops that promote different types of activities, including challenges, games, brainstorming, and networking sessions. The organizers discourage workshops that are structured as mini-conferences dominated by long talks and short discussions. Workshops should leave ample time for discussions and interaction between the participants and should also encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. 
  The workshop should have the potential to attract the interest of researchers in computer science and social science. Proposals involving people of different backgrounds in the organizing committee and addressing topics at the intersection of different disciplines will have a higher chance of acceptance. 
  Workshop organizers who want to publish the papers from their workshop (or significant portions of it) will have the opportunity to do so through workshop proceedings by the AAAI Press. For a list of last year's workshops see here  .   
 Workshop Proposal Contents   
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than five (5) pages in length (10pt, single column with reasonable margins), written in English, and should contain the following:   
 A concise title. 
  The names, affiliations, and contact information of the organizing committee. A main contact author should be specified. 
  An indication as to whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day meeting. 
  A short abstract describing the scope and main objective of the workshop. Identify the specific issues and research questions the workshop will focus on, with a brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time and for which research communities. 
  A two/three paragraph description of the workshop topic and themes. 
  A description of the proposed workshop format and a detailed list of proposed activities with special emphasis on those activities that distinguish it from a mini-conference (e.g., games brainstorming sessions, challenges, group activities). 
  An approximate timeline of the activities. 
  A description of how workshop submissions will be evaluated and selected (invited contributions, peer review: single/double blind, etc.). In case a PC is needed, provide a tentative list of the members. 
  Historical information about the workshop, if available. Short description of the previous editions reporting highlights and details about the approximate number of attendees and number of submissions. 
  A list of other related workshops held previously at related conferences, if any (list does not have to be exhaustive), together with a brief statement on how the proposed workshop differs from or how it follows-up on work presented at previous workshops. 
  A short bio for each member of the organizing committee, including a description of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. 
  A brief statement on whether any generative AI tools were used to generate ideas for the workshop or the workshop activities. Workshop organizers strongly discourage the use of generative AI to come up with workshop ideas and activities. 
  Please use the AAAI Author Kit  to format your submission. Your proposal should be emailed in a single file to the workshop chairs (Luca Rossi, Shruti Phadke, and Akhil Arora) at workshops@icwsm.org  before the deadline. For additional information please contact the workshop chairs at the same address.   

 ICWSM-2025 invites proposals for Tutorials Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). ICWSM-2025 is seeking proposals for tutorials on topics related to the computational analysis and understanding of social phenomena in the following formats:   
 Lecture-style:   Traditional tutorials to teach concepts, methodologies, tools, and software packages. Tutorials on novel and fast growing directions and significant applications are highly encouraged. The conference is paying particular attention to themes around new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing new forms of social media. Lecture-style tutorials on these themes are highly encouraged.   
 Hands-on:   Interactive, in-depth, hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools (with a proven track record in the community), targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users, with a focus on providing an engaging experience. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably.   
 Translation:   Tutorials that aim to translate concepts between disciplines. For example, such a tutorial could introduce social science concepts to computer scientists, or computational concepts to social scientists. Thus these tutorials should be geared towards a beginner audience.   
 Case study:   Focused tutorials that emphasize real world applications of ICWSM work. These tutorials should walk the audience through how research insights and tools were applied in practice. We welcome submissions from practitioners in industry, government, and NGOs in addition to academics.   
 Free-style:   We also welcome proposals for creative and unconventional training sessions, such as hackathons competitions/challenges, etc., as long as participants can learn practical skills and participate in an active way.   
 We welcome tutorials of various lengths (1, 2, 4, or up to 8 hours). We are looking for contributions from experts in both the social and computational sciences, in industry, academia, and beyond. For a list of tutorials from previous years, we encourage you to visit the tutorials page for 2018  , 2019  , 2020  , 2021  , 2022  , 2023  , and 2024  . We especially encourage applications from first-time proposers and scholars with   
 Acceptance Criteria   
 The format will be entirely determined by the tutorial organizers—i.e., you! Proposals will be selected for inclusion considering the following criteria:   
 Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to ICWSM attendees and research communities. 
  Cross-pollination potential. Tutorials that attract an interdisciplinary audience will be given preference. The proposals should highlight, when applicable, the tutorial's potential to transfer knowledge from one discipline/area to another. 
  Interactivity. We will favor tutorials that aim to include hands-on experiences collaborative approaches, and interactivity. 
  Completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and materials, including the schedule of the tutorial. 
  Expertise of the presenters. 
  Proposals of tutorials presented at past events are allowed, although novelty is a plus. The tutorial chairs may also reach out to potential tutorial presenters about a change in format length depending on expected increased interest or capacity constraints.   
 Tutorial Proposal Content and Format   
 Proposals for tutorials should be no more than three (3) pages in length. Proposal submissions should include the following information:   
 Title.  A concise title. 
  Abstract.  A short description (200 words) of the main objective of the tutorial, to be published on the main ICWSM website. 
  Type.  The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation case study, or free-style. 
  Names, affiliations, emails, and personal websites of the tutorial organizers.  A main contact author should be specified. A typical proposal should include no more than three presenters (more people can be involved in the organization). 
  Duration.  A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event. 
  Tutorial schedule and activities.  A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them. 
  Target audience, prerequisites and outcomes.  A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial. 
  Materials.  The organizers of accepted tutorials will be required to set up a web page containing all the information for the tutorial attendees before the tutorial day (roughly 2 weeks before the tutorial day). The proposal should contain the list of materials that will be made available on the website. 
  Past precedent  (when available). A list of other tutorials held previously at related conferences, if any, together with a brief statement on how the proposed tutorial relates to previous events. If the authors of the proposal have organized other tutorials in the past, pointers to the relevant material (e.g., slides, videos, web pages, code) should be provided. 
  Additional info for hands-on tutorials:    
 Operating system and required installed tools on attendees' devices. 
  List of software licenses required for the tools. 
  Setup instructions for attendees. (The setup should not take more than 1 hour to complete.) 
  Please use the AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  to format your submission. If you have questions on any of the submission requirements or for presubmission feedback/questions, please reach out to the tutorial chairs (Tunazzina Islam, Pablo Aragón, and Shadi Rezapour) at the address tutorials@icwsm.org  .   

 ICWSM 2025 will offer a new and experimental mentoring scheme for first-time ICWSM authors. Interested authors can submit a complete manuscript by August 1, 2024, 23:59 AoE. Qualifying manuscripts will receive written feedback from a Senior PC member by August 22 on how their manuscript can be improved. We hope that authors can incorporate the feedback and submit an improved manuscript in the regular ICWSM submission cycle  by September 15, 2024.  
 This scheme’s goal is to support young scholars, in particular in low-and-middle-income countries, and to increase ICWSM’s appeal to scholars in adjacent communities.  
  
  Before submitting your manuscript via a web form  , you will need to confirm that:  
 None of the authors has any prior ICWSM full papers, not counting poster, dataset or workshop papers. 
  Your manuscript is complete (typically 7-11 pages in a two-column format) without any missing sections. 
  You are available to substantially revise your paper between August 22 and September 15. 
  The manuscript presents academic research related to “the Web and social media”, broadly defined. 
   
  We also ask you to check whether the first author’s affiliation country qualifies as a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income economy according to the World Bank classification  . Authors from these countries will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 Similarly, in the submission form, we ask about prior experience with non-full-paper publications, e.g. dataset, poster or workshop publications, and about prior ICWSM attendance. Authors without any ICWSM experience will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 While not required, we suggest you follow the formatting guidelines  for ICWSM 2024 to save the time needed later for reformatting. However please include the author and affiliation information in the manuscript for the mentoring scheme.  
  
  Disclaimers:  
 We have limited capacity and cannot guarantee that your manuscript will receive mentoring. 
  Successful participation in the mentoring scheme does not guarantee your paper will be accepted for publication at ICWSM 2025. In particular, the paper, if submitted by Sep 15, 2024, will be handled by a different SPC member, who will not be informed of the paper’s mentoring history. 
   
  To participate please submit your document using this web form  no later than Aug 1, 2024, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth  .

References to authors' own prior relevant work should be included, but should not specify that this is the authors' own work. It is up to the authors' discretion how much to further modify the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers on the Web. Even in cases where the author's identity is known to a reviewer, the double-blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard to authors' reputation. Note that 2-page demo submissions and the dataset paper submissions, and only these, are exempt from the anonymization requirement as they often contain system URLs or URLs to data sharing services.   
 Revisions   : Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a "Revise and Resubmit " decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author's response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.   
 REQUIRED  Ethics Guidelines:   In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a new  checklist that describes the potential broader impact of their work and ethical considerations. Drawing on feedback from the 2023 ICWSM Town Hall and approaches used in other conferences, the 2024 ICWSM Program Committee Chairs have developed this checklist-based approach for the Ethics section of ICWSM papers submitted for the cycle 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. All papers should communicate the known or anticipated consequences of research via the paper checklist available as an Overleaf document   , and a PDF format   .  This completed and unaltered (i.e. no questions removed) checklist should come as the first section after the references of the paper. Authors may supplement this Paper Checklist (in the same section of the paper) with a brief discussion that expands on answers to the checklist where it is necessary to do so. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit, and that papers without such a statement will be desk-rejected.    
 Disclosure of funding and competing interests:   Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest, in a section (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) that should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers, but not in the version submitted for review (in order to maintain author anonymity). Furthermore, authors are required to read the  AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines   ; submitting to ICWSM implies that the authors agree to abide by these rules.  
 Resubmission:   Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the January round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.   
 Policy on Authorship:   ICWSM'25 will adopt the following subsection of ACM's new policy on authorship  , restated here: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the Acknowledgements section of the Work. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work.   
   
 Duplicate Submissions  : ICWSM-2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to submissions for non-archival workshops.  While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal. If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process then:   
 All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference 
  And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year. 
  Conference Registration  : Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s conference will open soon. Stay tuned!   
 Publication  : All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the 'social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)'; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate authors in addressing comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.   
 Datasets  : ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.

 Deadline:  Sun January 19th, 2025 11:59 PM Anywhere on Earth  
  Notifications:  Mon February 3rd, 2025   
 The ICWSM-2025 Committee invites proposals for Workshops Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM-2025). The Workshops Day will be held on June 23rd, 2025. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected focus -- providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers and developers from a wide range of disciplines, including social science and computer science. Workshops are an excellent forum for exploring emerging approaches and task areas bridging gaps between the social sciences and computing, and elucidating the results of exploratory research.   
 Members of the social media research community are encouraged to submit proposals. To foster interaction and exchange of ideas, the workshops will be kept small, with up to 40 participants.   
 The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. The two main criteria for the selection of the workshops will be the following:   
 The organizers encourage workshops that promote different types of activities, including challenges, games, brainstorming, and networking sessions. The organizers discourage workshops that are structured as mini-conferences dominated by long talks and short discussions. Workshops should leave ample time for discussions and interaction between the participants and should also encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. 
  The workshop should have the potential to attract the interest of researchers in computer science and social science. Proposals involving people of different backgrounds in the organizing committee and addressing topics at the intersection of different disciplines will have a higher chance of acceptance. 
  Workshop organizers who want to publish the papers from their workshop (or significant portions of it) will have the opportunity to do so through workshop proceedings by the AAAI Press. For a list of last year's workshops see here  .   
 Workshop Proposal Contents   
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than five (5) pages in length (10pt, single column with reasonable margins), written in English, and should contain the following:   
 A concise title. 
  The names, affiliations, and contact information of the organizing committee. A main contact author should be specified. 
  An indication as to whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day meeting. 
  A short abstract describing the scope and main objective of the workshop. Identify the specific issues and research questions the workshop will focus on, with a brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time and for which research communities. 
  A two/three paragraph description of the workshop topic and themes. 
  A description of the proposed workshop format and a detailed list of proposed activities with special emphasis on those activities that distinguish it from a mini-conference (e.g., games brainstorming sessions, challenges, group activities). 
  An approximate timeline of the activities. 
  A description of how workshop submissions will be evaluated and selected (invited contributions, peer review: single/double blind, etc.). In case a PC is needed, provide a tentative list of the members. 
  Historical information about the workshop, if available. Short description of the previous editions reporting highlights and details about the approximate number of attendees and number of submissions. 
  A list of other related workshops held previously at related conferences, if any (list does not have to be exhaustive), together with a brief statement on how the proposed workshop differs from or how it follows-up on work presented at previous workshops. 
  A short bio for each member of the organizing committee, including a description of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. 
  A brief statement on whether any generative AI tools were used to generate ideas for the workshop or the workshop activities. Workshop organizers strongly discourage the use of generative AI to come up with workshop ideas and activities. 
  Please use the AAAI Author Kit  to format your submission. Your proposal should be emailed in a single file to the workshop chairs (Luca Rossi, Shruti Phadke, and Akhil Arora) at workshops@icwsm.org  before the deadline. For additional information please contact the workshop chairs at the same address.   

 ICWSM-2025 invites proposals for Tutorials Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). ICWSM-2025 is seeking proposals for tutorials on topics related to the computational analysis and understanding of social phenomena in the following formats:   
 Lecture-style:   Traditional tutorials to teach concepts, methodologies, tools, and software packages. Tutorials on novel and fast growing directions and significant applications are highly encouraged. The conference is paying particular attention to themes around new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing new forms of social media. Lecture-style tutorials on these themes are highly encouraged.   
 Hands-on:   Interactive, in-depth, hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools (with a proven track record in the community), targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users, with a focus on providing an engaging experience. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably.   
 Translation:   Tutorials that aim to translate concepts between disciplines. For example, such a tutorial could introduce social science concepts to computer scientists, or computational concepts to social scientists. Thus these tutorials should be geared towards a beginner audience.   
 Case study:   Focused tutorials that emphasize real world applications of ICWSM work. These tutorials should walk the audience through how research insights and tools were applied in practice. We welcome submissions from practitioners in industry, government, and NGOs in addition to academics.   
 Free-style:   We also welcome proposals for creative and unconventional training sessions, such as hackathons competitions/challenges, etc., as long as participants can learn practical skills and participate in an active way.   
 We welcome tutorials of various lengths (1, 2, 4, or up to 8 hours). We are looking for contributions from experts in both the social and computational sciences, in industry, academia, and beyond. For a list of tutorials from previous years, we encourage you to visit the tutorials page for 2018  , 2019  , 2020  , 2021  , 2022  , 2023  , and 2024  . We especially encourage applications from first-time proposers and scholars with   
 Acceptance Criteria   
 The format will be entirely determined by the tutorial organizers—i.e., you! Proposals will be selected for inclusion considering the following criteria:   
 Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to ICWSM attendees and research communities. 
  Cross-pollination potential. Tutorials that attract an interdisciplinary audience will be given preference. The proposals should highlight, when applicable, the tutorial's potential to transfer knowledge from one discipline/area to another. 
  Interactivity. We will favor tutorials that aim to include hands-on experiences collaborative approaches, and interactivity. 
  Completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and materials, including the schedule of the tutorial. 
  Expertise of the presenters. 
  Proposals of tutorials presented at past events are allowed, although novelty is a plus. The tutorial chairs may also reach out to potential tutorial presenters about a change in format length depending on expected increased interest or capacity constraints.   
 Tutorial Proposal Content and Format   
 Proposals for tutorials should be no more than three (3) pages in length. Proposal submissions should include the following information:   
 Title.  A concise title. 
  Abstract.  A short description (200 words) of the main objective of the tutorial, to be published on the main ICWSM website. 
  Type.  The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation case study, or free-style. 
  Names, affiliations, emails, and personal websites of the tutorial organizers.  A main contact author should be specified. A typical proposal should include no more than three presenters (more people can be involved in the organization). 
  Duration.  A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event. 
  Tutorial schedule and activities.  A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them. 
  Target audience, prerequisites and outcomes.  A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial. 
  Materials.  The organizers of accepted tutorials will be required to set up a web page containing all the information for the tutorial attendees before the tutorial day (roughly 2 weeks before the tutorial day). The proposal should contain the list of materials that will be made available on the website. 
  Past precedent  (when available). A list of other tutorials held previously at related conferences, if any, together with a brief statement on how the proposed tutorial relates to previous events. If the authors of the proposal have organized other tutorials in the past, pointers to the relevant material (e.g., slides, videos, web pages, code) should be provided. 
  Additional info for hands-on tutorials:    
 Operating system and required installed tools on attendees' devices. 
  List of software licenses required for the tools. 
  Setup instructions for attendees. (The setup should not take more than 1 hour to complete.) 
  Please use the AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  to format your submission. If you have questions on any of the submission requirements or for presubmission feedback/questions, please reach out to the tutorial chairs (Tunazzina Islam, Pablo Aragón, and Shadi Rezapour) at the address tutorials@icwsm.org  .   

 ICWSM 2025 will offer a new and experimental mentoring scheme for first-time ICWSM authors. Interested authors can submit a complete manuscript by August 1, 2024, 23:59 AoE. Qualifying manuscripts will receive written feedback from a Senior PC member by August 22 on how their manuscript can be improved. We hope that authors can incorporate the feedback and submit an improved manuscript in the regular ICWSM submission cycle  by September 15, 2024.  
 This scheme’s goal is to support young scholars, in particular in low-and-middle-income countries, and to increase ICWSM’s appeal to scholars in adjacent communities.  
  
  Before submitting your manuscript via a web form  , you will need to confirm that:  
 None of the authors has any prior ICWSM full papers, not counting poster, dataset or workshop papers. 
  Your manuscript is complete (typically 7-11 pages in a two-column format) without any missing sections. 
  You are available to substantially revise your paper between August 22 and September 15. 
  The manuscript presents academic research related to “the Web and social media”, broadly defined. 
   
  We also ask you to check whether the first author’s affiliation country qualifies as a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income economy according to the World Bank classification  . Authors from these countries will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 Similarly, in the submission form, we ask about prior experience with non-full-paper publications, e.g. dataset, poster or workshop publications, and about prior ICWSM attendance. Authors without any ICWSM experience will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 While not required, we suggest you follow the formatting guidelines  for ICWSM 2024 to save the time needed later for reformatting. However please include the author and affiliation information in the manuscript for the mentoring scheme.  
  
  Disclaimers:  
 We have limited capacity and cannot guarantee that your manuscript will receive mentoring. 
  Successful participation in the mentoring scheme does not guarantee your paper will be accepted for publication at ICWSM 2025. In particular, the paper, if submitted by Sep 15, 2024, will be handled by a different SPC member, who will not be informed of the paper’s mentoring history. 
   
  To participate please submit your document using this web form  no later than Aug 1, 2024, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth  .

 Brief Full Paper Submission Information  
 Full Paper Submission Site (new submissions only - not revisions)   
 Register or log in to PCS account to access the above link 
  After registering/logging in, click on the Submissions tab and make the following selections from the dropdown menus: Society: AAAI. Conference/Journal: ICWSM 25. Track: ICWSM 25 January Submissions. 
  After clicking "Go" a placeholder submission will appear in the table below. Click on "Edit Submission" to add your paper details. 
  The submission will be marked complete when you have entered all the required fields, but you will still be able to make edits until submissions are closed. 
  The 2025 reviewing process will be similar to that of the 2024 process. The new, required  Paper Checklist  section introduced in 2024 will be continued this year and all papers accepted to ICWSM-2025 will be required to have this section. Papers to be considered for publication in the ICWSM proceedings, and presentation at the ICWSM-2025 conference, must be submitted by one of the remaining submission deadlines listed above. See also the Paper Checklist as PDF here.   
 Authors who receive the "Accept" recommendation will have the opportunity to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors who receive the "Revise and Resubmit" recommendation will have the opportunity to address reviewer suggestions and resubmit an improved manuscript in the next submission deadline.  
 Papers accepted no later than March 2025, will be presented at the ICWSM-2025 conference and will be published in the corresponding conference proceedings. Authors who receive "Revise and Resubmit" in March 2025 will likely be presenting during the 2026 conference if their papers get accepted during the next submission round in May 2025.  
 See the complete submission guidelines  below for more information.  
 Full Formatting Guidelines for Paper Submission  
 Content Guidelines   
 Format   : All papers must be submitted as high-resolution PDF files, formatted in AAAI two-column camera-ready style, for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts (available templates:  AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or  AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  ).  . Full papers are recommended to be 8 pages long, and must be at most 11 pages long, including only the main text and the references. The mandatory Ethics Checklist (and brief additional Ethics Statement, if desired, see below), optional appendices, etc. do not count toward the page limit and should be placed after the references. Appendices, if they exist, should be placed after the Ethics Checklist.  Revision papers and final camera-ready full papers can be up to 12 pages. No source files (Word or LaTeX) are required at the time of submission for review; only the PDF file is permitted. Finally, the copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase, and no copyright form is required until a paper is accepted for publication.  
 Language   : All submission must be in English.   
 Anonymity   : ICWSM-2025 review is double-blind. Therefore, please anonymize your submission: do not put the author names or affiliations at the start of the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review. References to authors' own prior relevant work should be included, but should not specify that this is the authors' own work. It is up to the authors' discretion how much to further modify the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers on the Web. Even in cases where the author's identity is known to a reviewer, the double-blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard to authors' reputation. Note that 2-page demo submissions and the dataset paper submissions, and only these, are exempt from the anonymization requirement as they often contain system URLs or URLs to data sharing services.   
 Revisions   : Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a "Revise and Resubmit " decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author's response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.   
 REQUIRED  Ethics Guidelines:   In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a new  checklist that describes the potential broader impact of their work and ethical considerations. Drawing on feedback from the 2023 ICWSM Town Hall and approaches used in other conferences, the 2024 ICWSM Program Committee Chairs have developed this checklist-based approach for the Ethics section of ICWSM papers submitted for the cycle 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. All papers should communicate the known or anticipated consequences of research via the paper checklist available as an Overleaf document   , and a PDF format   .  This completed and unaltered (i.e. no questions removed) checklist should come as the first section after the references of the paper. Authors may supplement this Paper Checklist (in the same section of the paper) with a brief discussion that expands on answers to the checklist where it is necessary to do so. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit, and that papers without such a statement will be desk-rejected.    
 Disclosure of funding and competing interests:   Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest, in a section (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) that should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers, but not in the version submitted for review (in order to maintain author anonymity). Furthermore, authors are required to read the  AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines   ; submitting to ICWSM implies that the authors agree to abide by these rules.  
 Resubmission:   Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the January round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.   
 Policy on Authorship:   ICWSM'25 will adopt the following subsection of ACM's new policy on authorship  , restated here: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the Acknowledgements section of the Work. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work.   
   
 Duplicate Submissions  : ICWSM-2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to submissions for non-archival workshops.  While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal. If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process then:   
 All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference 
  And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year. 
  Conference Registration  : Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s conference will open soon. Stay tuned!   
 Publication  : All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the 'social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)'; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate authors in addressing comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.   
 Datasets  : ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.

 Deadline:  Sun January 19th, 2025 11:59 PM Anywhere on Earth  
  Notifications:  Mon February 3rd, 2025   
 The ICWSM-2025 Committee invites proposals for Workshops Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM-2025). The Workshops Day will be held on June 23rd, 2025. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected focus -- providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers and developers from a wide range of disciplines, including social science and computer science. Workshops are an excellent forum for exploring emerging approaches and task areas bridging gaps between the social sciences and computing, and elucidating the results of exploratory research.   
 Members of the social media research community are encouraged to submit proposals. To foster interaction and exchange of ideas, the workshops will be kept small, with up to 40 participants.   
 The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. The two main criteria for the selection of the workshops will be the following:   
 The organizers encourage workshops that promote different types of activities, including challenges, games, brainstorming, and networking sessions. The organizers discourage workshops that are structured as mini-conferences dominated by long talks and short discussions. Workshops should leave ample time for discussions and interaction between the participants and should also encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. 
  The workshop should have the potential to attract the interest of researchers in computer science and social science. Proposals involving people of different backgrounds in the organizing committee and addressing topics at the intersection of different disciplines will have a higher chance of acceptance. 
  Workshop organizers who want to publish the papers from their workshop (or significant portions of it) will have the opportunity to do so through workshop proceedings by the AAAI Press. For a list of last year's workshops see here  .   
 Workshop Proposal Contents   
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than five (5) pages in length (10pt, single column with reasonable margins), written in English, and should contain the following:   
 A concise title. 
  The names, affiliations, and contact information of the organizing committee. A main contact author should be specified. 
  An indication as to whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day meeting. 
  A short abstract describing the scope and main objective of the workshop. Identify the specific issues and research questions the workshop will focus on, with a brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time and for which research communities. 
  A two/three paragraph description of the workshop topic and themes. 
  A description of the proposed workshop format and a detailed list of proposed activities with special emphasis on those activities that distinguish it from a mini-conference (e.g., games brainstorming sessions, challenges, group activities). 
  An approximate timeline of the activities. 
  A description of how workshop submissions will be evaluated and selected (invited contributions, peer review: single/double blind, etc.). In case a PC is needed, provide a tentative list of the members. 
  Historical information about the workshop, if available. Short description of the previous editions reporting highlights and details about the approximate number of attendees and number of submissions. 
  A list of other related workshops held previously at related conferences, if any (list does not have to be exhaustive), together with a brief statement on how the proposed workshop differs from or how it follows-up on work presented at previous workshops. 
  A short bio for each member of the organizing committee, including a description of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. 
  A brief statement on whether any generative AI tools were used to generate ideas for the workshop or the workshop activities. Workshop organizers strongly discourage the use of generative AI to come up with workshop ideas and activities. 
  Please use the AAAI Author Kit  to format your submission. Your proposal should be emailed in a single file to the workshop chairs (Luca Rossi, Shruti Phadke, and Akhil Arora) at workshops@icwsm.org  before the deadline. For additional information please contact the workshop chairs at the same address.   

 ICWSM-2025 invites proposals for Tutorials Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). ICWSM-2025 is seeking proposals for tutorials on topics related to the computational analysis and understanding of social phenomena in the following formats:   
 Lecture-style:   Traditional tutorials to teach concepts, methodologies, tools, and software packages. Tutorials on novel and fast growing directions and significant applications are highly encouraged. The conference is paying particular attention to themes around new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing new forms of social media. Lecture-style tutorials on these themes are highly encouraged.   
 Hands-on:   Interactive, in-depth, hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools (with a proven track record in the community), targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users, with a focus on providing an engaging experience. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably.   
 Translation:   Tutorials that aim to translate concepts between disciplines. For example, such a tutorial could introduce social science concepts to computer scientists, or computational concepts to social scientists. Thus these tutorials should be geared towards a beginner audience.   
 Case study:   Focused tutorials that emphasize real world applications of ICWSM work. These tutorials should walk the audience through how research insights and tools were applied in practice. We welcome submissions from practitioners in industry, government, and NGOs in addition to academics.   
 Free-style:   We also welcome proposals for creative and unconventional training sessions, such as hackathons competitions/challenges, etc., as long as participants can learn practical skills and participate in an active way.   
 We welcome tutorials of various lengths (1, 2, 4, or up to 8 hours). We are looking for contributions from experts in both the social and computational sciences, in industry, academia, and beyond. For a list of tutorials from previous years, we encourage you to visit the tutorials page for 2018  , 2019  , 2020  , 2021  , 2022  , 2023  , and 2024  . We especially encourage applications from first-time proposers and scholars with   
 Acceptance Criteria   
 The format will be entirely determined by the tutorial organizers—i.e., you! Proposals will be selected for inclusion considering the following criteria:   
 Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to ICWSM attendees and research communities. 
  Cross-pollination potential. Tutorials that attract an interdisciplinary audience will be given preference. The proposals should highlight, when applicable, the tutorial's potential to transfer knowledge from one discipline/area to another. 
  Interactivity. We will favor tutorials that aim to include hands-on experiences collaborative approaches, and interactivity. 
  Completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and materials, including the schedule of the tutorial. 
  Expertise of the presenters. 
  Proposals of tutorials presented at past events are allowed, although novelty is a plus. The tutorial chairs may also reach out to potential tutorial presenters about a change in format length depending on expected increased interest or capacity constraints.   
 Tutorial Proposal Content and Format   
 Proposals for tutorials should be no more than three (3) pages in length. Proposal submissions should include the following information:   
 Title.  A concise title. 
  Abstract.  A short description (200 words) of the main objective of the tutorial, to be published on the main ICWSM website. 
  Type.  The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation case study, or free-style. 
  Names, affiliations, emails, and personal websites of the tutorial organizers.  A main contact author should be specified. A typical proposal should include no more than three presenters (more people can be involved in the organization). 
  Duration.  A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event. 
  Tutorial schedule and activities.  A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them. 
  Target audience, prerequisites and outcomes.  A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial. 
  Materials.  The organizers of accepted tutorials will be required to set up a web page containing all the information for the tutorial attendees before the tutorial day (roughly 2 weeks before the tutorial day). The proposal should contain the list of materials that will be made available on the website. 
  Past precedent  (when available). A list of other tutorials held previously at related conferences, if any, together with a brief statement on how the proposed tutorial relates to previous events. If the authors of the proposal have organized other tutorials in the past, pointers to the relevant material (e.g., slides, videos, web pages, code) should be provided. 
  Additional info for hands-on tutorials:    
 Operating system and required installed tools on attendees' devices. 
  List of software licenses required for the tools. 
  Setup instructions for attendees. (The setup should not take more than 1 hour to complete.) 
  Please use the AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  to format your submission. If you have questions on any of the submission requirements or for presubmission feedback/questions, please reach out to the tutorial chairs (Tunazzina Islam, Pablo Aragón, and Shadi Rezapour) at the address tutorials@icwsm.org  .   

 ICWSM 2025 will offer a new and experimental mentoring scheme for first-time ICWSM authors. Interested authors can submit a complete manuscript by August 1, 2024, 23:59 AoE. Qualifying manuscripts will receive written feedback from a Senior PC member by August 22 on how their manuscript can be improved. We hope that authors can incorporate the feedback and submit an improved manuscript in the regular ICWSM submission cycle  by September 15, 2024.  
 This scheme’s goal is to support young scholars, in particular in low-and-middle-income countries, and to increase ICWSM’s appeal to scholars in adjacent communities.  
  
  Before submitting your manuscript via a web form  , you will need to confirm that:  
 None of the authors has any prior ICWSM full papers, not counting poster, dataset or workshop papers. 
  Your manuscript is complete (typically 7-11 pages in a two-column format) without any missing sections. 
  You are available to substantially revise your paper between August 22 and September 15. 
  The manuscript presents academic research related to “the Web and social media”, broadly defined. 
   
  We also ask you to check whether the first author’s affiliation country qualifies as a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income economy according to the World Bank classification  . Authors from these countries will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 Similarly, in the submission form, we ask about prior experience with non-full-paper publications, e.g. dataset, poster or workshop publications, and about prior ICWSM attendance. Authors without any ICWSM experience will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 While not required, we suggest you follow the formatting guidelines  for ICWSM 2024 to save the time needed later for reformatting. However please include the author and affiliation information in the manuscript for the mentoring scheme.  
  
  Disclaimers:  
 We have limited capacity and cannot guarantee that your manuscript will receive mentoring. 
  Successful participation in the mentoring scheme does not guarantee your paper will be accepted for publication at ICWSM 2025. In particular, the paper, if submitted by Sep 15, 2024, will be handled by a different SPC member, who will not be informed of the paper’s mentoring history. 
   
  To participate please submit your document using this web form  no later than Aug 1, 2024, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth  .

 Brief Full Paper Submission Information  
 Full Paper Submission Site (new submissions only - not revisions)   
 Register or log in to PCS account to access the above link 
  After registering/logging in, click on the Submissions tab and make the following selections from the dropdown menus: Society: AAAI. Conference/Journal: ICWSM 25. Track: ICWSM 25 January Submissions. 
  After clicking "Go" a placeholder submission will appear in the table below. Click on "Edit Submission" to add your paper details. 
  The submission will be marked complete when you have entered all the required fields, but you will still be able to make edits until submissions are closed. 
  The 2025 reviewing process will be similar to that of the 2024 process. The new, required  Paper Checklist  section introduced in 2024 will be continued this year and all papers accepted to ICWSM-2025 will be required to have this section. Papers to be considered for publication in the ICWSM proceedings, and presentation at the ICWSM-2025 conference, must be submitted by one of the remaining submission deadlines listed above. See also the Paper Checklist as PDF here.   
 Authors who receive the "Accept" recommendation will have the opportunity to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors who receive the "Revise and Resubmit" recommendation will have the opportunity to address reviewer suggestions and resubmit an improved manuscript in the next submission deadline.  
 Papers accepted no later than March 2025, will be presented at the ICWSM-2025 conference and will be published in the corresponding conference proceedings. Authors who receive "Revise and Resubmit" in March 2025 will likely be presenting during the 2026 conference if their papers get accepted during the next submission round in May 2025.  
 See the complete submission guidelines  below for more information.  
 Full Formatting Guidelines for Paper Submission  
 Content Guidelines   
 Format   : All papers must be submitted as high-resolution PDF files, formatted in AAAI two-column camera-ready style, for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts (available templates:  AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf  or  AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]  ).  . Full papers are recommended to be 8 pages long, and must be at most 11 pages long, including only the main text and the references. The mandatory Ethics Checklist (and brief additional Ethics Statement, if desired, see below), optional appendices, etc. do not count toward the page limit and should be placed after the references. Appendices, if they exist, should be placed after the Ethics Checklist.  Revision papers and final camera-ready full papers can be up to 12 pages. No source files (Word or LaTeX) are required at the time of submission for review; only the PDF file is permitted. Finally, the copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase, and no copyright form is required until a paper is accepted for publication.  
 Language   : All submission must be in English.   
 Anonymity   : ICWSM-2025 review is double-blind. Therefore, please anonymize your submission: do not put the author names or affiliations at the start of the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review. References to authors' own prior relevant work should be included, but should not specify that this is the authors' own work. It is up to the authors' discretion how much to further modify the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers on the Web. Even in cases where the author's identity is known to a reviewer, the double-blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard to authors' reputation. Note that 2-page demo submissions and the dataset paper submissions, and only these, are exempt from the anonymization requirement as they often contain system URLs or URLs to data sharing services.   
 Revisions   : Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a "Revise and Resubmit " decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author's response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.   
 REQUIRED  Ethics Guidelines:   In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a new  checklist that describes the potential broader impact of their work and ethical considerations. Drawing on feedback from the 2023 ICWSM Town Hall and approaches used in other conferences, the 2024 ICWSM Program Committee Chairs have developed this checklist-based approach for the Ethics section of ICWSM papers submitted for the cycle 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. All papers should communicate the known or anticipated consequences of research via the paper checklist available as an Overleaf document   , and a PDF format   .  This completed and unaltered (i.e. no questions removed) checklist should come as the first section after the references of the paper. Authors may supplement this Paper Checklist (in the same section of the paper) with a brief discussion that expands on answers to the checklist where it is necessary to do so. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit, and that papers without such a statement will be desk-rejected.    
 Disclosure of funding and competing interests:   Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest, in a section (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) that should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers, but not in the version submitted for review (in order to maintain author anonymity). Furthermore, authors are required to read the  AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines   ; submitting to ICWSM implies that the authors agree to abide by these rules.  
 Resubmission:   Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the January round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.   
 Policy on Authorship:   ICWSM'25 will adopt the following subsection of ACM's new policy on authorship  , restated here: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the Acknowledgements section of the Work. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work.   
   
 Duplicate Submissions  : ICWSM-2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to submissions for non-archival workshops.  While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal. If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process then:   
 All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference 
  And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year. 
  Conference Registration  : Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s conference will open soon. Stay tuned!   
 Publication  : All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the 'social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)'; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate authors in addressing comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.   
 Datasets  : ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.

 The ICWSM-2025 Committee invites proposals for Workshops Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM-2025). The Workshops Day will be held on June 23rd, 2025. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected focus -- providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers and developers from a wide range of disciplines, including social science and computer science. Workshops are an excellent forum for exploring emerging approaches and task areas bridging gaps between the social sciences and computing, and elucidating the results of exploratory research.   
 Members of the social media research community are encouraged to submit proposals. To foster interaction and exchange of ideas, the workshops will be kept small, with up to 40 participants.   
 The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. The two main criteria for the selection of the workshops will be the following:   
 The organizers encourage workshops that promote different types of activities, including challenges, games, brainstorming, and networking sessions. The organizers discourage workshops that are structured as mini-conferences dominated by long talks and short discussions. Workshops should leave ample time for discussions and interaction between the participants and should also encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. 
  The workshop should have the potential to attract the interest of researchers in computer science and social science. Proposals involving people of different backgrounds in the organizing committee and addressing topics at the intersection of different disciplines will have a higher chance of acceptance. 
  Workshop organizers who want to publish the papers from their workshop (or significant portions of it) will have the opportunity to do so through workshop proceedings by the AAAI Press. For a list of last year's workshops see here  .   
 Workshop Proposal Contents   
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than five (5) pages in length (10pt, single column with reasonable margins), written in English, and should contain the following:   
 A concise title. 
  The names, affiliations, and contact information of the organizing committee. A main contact author should be specified. 
  An indication as to whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day meeting. 
  A short abstract describing the scope and main objective of the workshop. Identify the specific issues and research questions the workshop will focus on, with a brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time and for which research communities. 
  A two/three paragraph description of the workshop topic and themes. 
  A description of the proposed workshop format and a detailed list of proposed activities with special emphasis on those activities that distinguish it from a mini-conference (e.g., games brainstorming sessions, challenges, group activities). 
  An approximate timeline of the activities. 
  A description of how workshop submissions will be evaluated and selected (invited contributions, peer review: single/double blind, etc.). In case a PC is needed, provide a tentative list of the members. 
  Historical information about the workshop, if available. Short description of the previous editions reporting highlights and details about the approximate number of attendees and number of submissions. 
  A list of other related workshops held previously at related conferences, if any (list does not have to be exhaustive), together with a brief statement on how the proposed workshop differs from or how it follows-up on work presented at previous workshops. 
  A short bio for each member of the organizing committee, including a description of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. 
  A brief statement on whether any generative AI tools were used to generate ideas for the workshop or the workshop activities. Workshop organizers strongly discourage the use of generative AI to come up with workshop ideas and activities. 
  Please use the AAAI Author Kit  to format your submission. Your proposal should be emailed in a single file to the workshop chairs (Luca Rossi, Shruti Phadke, and Akhil Arora) at workshops@icwsm.org  before the deadline. For additional information please contact the workshop chairs at the same address.   

 ICWSM-2025 invites proposals for Tutorials Day at the 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). ICWSM-2025 is seeking proposals for tutorials on topics related to the computational analysis and understanding of social phenomena in the following formats:   
 Lecture-style:   Traditional tutorials to teach concepts, methodologies, tools, and software packages. Tutorials on novel and fast growing directions and significant applications are highly encouraged. The conference is paying particular attention to themes around new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing new forms of social media. Lecture-style tutorials on these themes are highly encouraged.   
 Hands-on:   Interactive, in-depth, hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools (with a proven track record in the community), targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users, with a focus on providing an engaging experience. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably.   
 Translation:   Tutorials that aim to translate concepts between disciplines. For example, such a tutorial could introduce social science concepts to computer scientists, or computational concepts to social scientists. Thus these tutorials should be geared towards a beginner audience.   
 Case study:   Focused tutorials that emphasize real world applications of ICWSM work. These tutorials should walk the audience through how research insights and tools were applied in practice. We welcome submissions from practitioners in industry, government, and NGOs in addition to academics.   
 Free-style:   We also welcome proposals for creative and unconventional training sessions, such as hackathons competitions/challenges, etc., as long as participants can learn practical skills and participate in an active way.   
 We welcome tutorials of various lengths (1, 2, 4, or up to 8 hours). We are looking for contributions from experts in both the social and computational sciences, in industry, academia, and beyond. For a list of tutorials from previous years, we encourage you to visit the tutorials page for 2018  , 2019  , 2020  , 2021  , 2022  , 2023  , and 2024  . We especially encourage applications from first-time proposers and scholars with   
 Acceptance Criteria   
 The format will be entirely determined by the tutorial organizers—i.e., you! Proposals will be selected for inclusion considering the following criteria:   
 Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to ICWSM attendees and research communities. 
  Cross-pollination potential. Tutorials that attract an interdisciplinary audience will be given preference. The proposals should highlight, when applicable, the tutorial's potential to transfer knowledge from one discipline/area to another. 
  Interactivity. We will favor tutorials that aim to include hands-on experiences collaborative approaches, and interactivity. 
  Completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and materials, including the schedule of the tutorial. 
  Expertise of the presenters. 
  Proposals of tutorials presented at past events are allowed, although novelty is a plus. The tutorial chairs may also reach out to potential tutorial presenters about a change in format length depending on expected increased interest or capacity constraints.   
 Tutorial Proposal Content and Format   
 Proposals for tutorials should be no more than three (3) pages in length. Proposal submissions should include the following information:   
 Title.  A concise title. 
  Abstract.  A short description (200 words) of the main objective of the tutorial, to be published on the main ICWSM website. 
  Type.  The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation case study, or free-style. 
  Names, affiliations, emails, and personal websites of the tutorial organizers.  A main contact author should be specified. A typical proposal should include no more than three presenters (more people can be involved in the organization). 
  Duration.  A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event. 
  Tutorial schedule and activities.  A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them. 
  Target audience, prerequisites and outcomes.  A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial. 
  Materials.  The organizers of accepted tutorials will be required to set up a web page containing all the information for the tutorial attendees before the tutorial day (roughly 2 weeks before the tutorial day). The proposal should contain the list of materials that will be made available on the website. 
  Past precedent  (when available). A list of other tutorials held previously at related conferences, if any, together with a brief statement on how the proposed tutorial relates to previous events. If the authors of the proposal have organized other tutorials in the past, pointers to the relevant material (e.g., slides, videos, web pages, code) should be provided. 
  Additional info for hands-on tutorials:    
 Operating system and required installed tools on attendees' devices.

 ICWSM 2025 will offer a new and experimental mentoring scheme for first-time ICWSM authors. Interested authors can submit a complete manuscript by August 1, 2024, 23:59 AoE. Qualifying manuscripts will receive written feedback from a Senior PC member by August 22 on how their manuscript can be improved. We hope that authors can incorporate the feedback and submit an improved manuscript in the regular ICWSM submission cycle  by September 15, 2024.  
 This scheme’s goal is to support young scholars, in particular in low-and-middle-income countries, and to increase ICWSM’s appeal to scholars in adjacent communities.  
  
  Before submitting your manuscript via a web form  , you will need to confirm that:  
 None of the authors has any prior ICWSM full papers, not counting poster, dataset or workshop papers. 
  Your manuscript is complete (typically 7-11 pages in a two-column format) without any missing sections. 
  You are available to substantially revise your paper between August 22 and September 15. 
  The manuscript presents academic research related to “the Web and social media”, broadly defined. 
   
  We also ask you to check whether the first author’s affiliation country qualifies as a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income economy according to the World Bank classification  . Authors from these countries will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 Similarly, in the submission form, we ask about prior experience with non-full-paper publications, e.g. dataset, poster or workshop publications, and about prior ICWSM attendance. Authors without any ICWSM experience will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 While not required, we suggest you follow the formatting guidelines  for ICWSM 2024 to save the time needed later for reformatting. However please include the author and affiliation information in the manuscript for the mentoring scheme.  
  
  Disclaimers:  
 We have limited capacity and cannot guarantee that your manuscript will receive mentoring. 
  Successful participation in the mentoring scheme does not guarantee your paper will be accepted for publication at ICWSM 2025. In particular, the paper, if submitted by Sep 15, 2024, will be handled by a different SPC member, who will not be informed of the paper’s mentoring history. 
   
  To participate please submit your document using this web form  no later than Aug 1, 2024, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth  .

 Introduction of ICWS  

 Founded in 2003, the International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) has been a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of Web-based services, identify emerging research topics, and define the future of Web-based services. All topics regarding Web-centric services, enabling technologies and applications align with the theme of ICWS. ICWS 2018  was successfully held on June 25 - June 30, 2018, Seattle, USA. ICWS 2019  was successfully held on June 25-30, 2019, San Diego, USA. ICWS 2020  and ICWS 2021  was successfully held virtually on Internet. ICWS 2022   was successfully held on December 10 - 14, 2022, Hawaii, USA. ICWS 2023  was successfully held on September 23 - 26, 2023, Honolulu Hawaii, USA and Satellite Sessions in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. In 2024, we will celebrate ICWS' 21-year-old birthday, to strive to advance the international professional forum on Web-centric services, and their enabling technologies and applications.  
 ICWS 2024 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2024 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2024 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2024), 2024 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2024), 2024 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2024), 2024 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2024), 2024 International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2024), and 2024 International Conference on Metaverse (METAVERSE 2024), 2024 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2024), 2024 International conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2024), 2024 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2024), and 2024 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2024).  
 Started in 2003, the long-term goal of ICWS is to build up the most reputable conference for the international community on Internet and Web-based services. It is very clear that the ICWS belongs to everyone. As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), the first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)   was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 ( ICWS-Europe 2003  ) was held in Germany in October 2003. ICWS-Europe'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services ( ECOWS  ), which was held at Erfurt, Germany.  
 Sponsored by Services Society and Springer, SCF 2018 and SCF 2019 was held successfully in Seattle and San Diego, USA. SCF 2020 and SCF 2021 was held successfully online and in Shenzhen, China. SCF 2022 was held successfully in Hawaii, USA. SCF 2023 was held successfully in Honolulu Hawaii, USA and Satellite Sessions in Shenzhen, China. To celebrate its 21-year-old birthday, SCF 2024 will be held on  November 16 - 19, 2024, Bangkok, Thailand  .

 Publishing with IGI Global has been a very positive experience. We have been guided through the very complicated process swiftly and securely by simply following their concise instructions. The response to the first edition was much greater than expected, I think due to the excellent marketing system of IGI Global. The ability to get the book delivered to the world is not less important than the writing of it. As authors, we are very grateful to IGI Global for all of their efforts on our behalf.

 The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, particularly in engineering drawing courses, enhances content richness and engagement, stimulating student enthusiasm and improving teaching quality. This paper examines the design of a multimedia teaching system incorporating virtual reality (VR) for engineering drawing. Key technologies such as graphics processing, 3D modeling, and dynamic databases are researched. Tools like Dreamweaver, Fireworks, SolidWorks, and 3DS MAX are used to create and integrate 3D models into web pages, forming a 3D model library. This library provides a flexible, content-rich, online learning environment that promotes self-study, enhances spatial imagination, and improves the quality of engineering drawing education. Establishing a virtual model library supports multimedia teaching and replaces traditional physical model rooms.

 In crowdsourced testing, prioritizing numerous test reports is critical for improving developer review efficiency. Many researchers have proposed methods for prioritizing crowdsourced test reports for mobile applications, however, web crowdsourced test reports usually contain more detailed text and more complex screenshots, which makes prioritizing them especially necessary. This paper proposes a prioritization method named TCDiv, based on the data characteristics of web crowdsourcing test reports. First, using a pre-trained TextCNN model, the text of each report is segmented into two parts: reproduction steps and defect descriptions. Then, features are extracted from textual and image information respectively, and clustering technique is utilized to classify similar reports, and finally the clustering results are ranked and sampled. To validate the approach, experiments were conducted on 717 web crowdsourced test reports. The results show that TCDiv can detect more different defects in a limited time, thus improving the review efficiency of the development team.

 To improve the quality of photovoltaic (PV) data and power prediction accuracy, a PV power prediction method based on neighborhood rough set and Pearson correlation coefficient (NRS-PCC) feature selection and multi-scale convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network is proposed. We first calculate the correlation between different PV features based on PCC and select strongly correlated features to cross-multiply to get the fusion features to enrich the data source. Then, dimensionality reduction of the fusion features by NRS. Finally, correlation analysis based on PCC on the dimensionality reduction of the fusion features to screen out the effective features. Furthermore, a multi-scale CNN-LSTM is designed to predict PV power. The output vectors of different convolutional layers are first fused to extract multi-scale features, then the features of different scales are spliced as the input of the LSTM network, and finally, the LSTM network performs regression prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a real PV power dataset.

 IDA 2025 will take place in Konstanz, Germany, May 7-9 2025.  
  
 Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis  requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore IDA accepts all inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. In order to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion, the IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track.

 Regular paper track  

 The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) 2025 will take place May 7-9, 2025, in Konstanz, Germany.  
  
 Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as an exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore, IDA accepts inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. The IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion. In addition, IDA awards the Frontier Prize every year, recognizing the most visionary contributions.  
  
 Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process; author identities are known to reviewers. The conventional reviewing process favors incremental advances on established work and can discourage the kinds of papers that IDA 2025 aims to publish. The reviewing process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers based on novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior program committee (SPC) members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review score.  
 All accepted paper contributions will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series  by Springer-Verlag.  

 Formatting instructions  
 Contributions written in English must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. These guidelines, along with templates, are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  .  
  
 We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page limit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices, is 10 to 12 pages in LNCS format. Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website.  
  
 Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or that has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of IDA 2025. The authors, their contact information, or affiliations may not be changed after the paper submission deadline. If the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must register for the conference and present the paper in person in Konstanz.  

 Submission  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. The submission interface is available here:

 FAQ  
 Does IDA have a ‘double-blind’ peer-reviewing policy?   
 No, IDA uses standard single-blind peer-reviewing, meaning that reviewers are unknown to the authors, but authors are known to the reviewers. This implies that authors should not hide their identity in the paper.  
 What should I do if my paper is longer than the page limit?   
 Shorten it; submissions that deviate from the guidelines may be rejected without consideration. The length of the contribution, including figures, title pages, references and appendices, must be between 10-12 pages for the Proceedings Track.  
 Will there be a separate call for the PhD forum?   
 Yes, you will find the Call for PhD forum here  .  
 I am PhD student and would like to submit a full paper. To which track should I submit?   
 You should submit your paper to the regular paper track. The PhD forum offers PhD student to give a short presentation about their work and collect feedback, but it does not provide full-paper publications.  
 Can I post my submitted paper on ArXiv.org?   
 Yes, posting your submitted paper on a self-archiving website is allowed.
