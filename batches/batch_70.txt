 Introduction  
 TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning. In the early years, most contributions came from the Artificial Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other areas such as Temporal Logic and Verification and partly from Temporal Databases has been increasing in the last years.

 Artifact Evaluation for TACAS 2025  
 TACAS 2025  will include an artifact evaluation (AE).  
 For regular tool papers and tool demonstration papers, AE is | compulsory | and artifacts | must | be submitted by the end of | October 24 th  , 2024 | , "anywhere on Earth" (UTC-12). 
  For research and case study papers, AE is | optional | and artifacts | may | be submitted by the end of | January 9 th  , 2025 | , "anywhere on Earth" (UTC-12). 
  In either case, authors must indicate at paper submission  whether an artifact will be submitted. Authors who did not indicate that they intend to submit an artifact will not have their artifact evaluated.  
 Important Dates  
 Tool and Tool Demonstration Papers: Oct 24 - Artifact Submission 
  Nov 10 - Smoke-Test Deadline 
  Nov 22 - Main Review Phase starts 
  Dec 20 - Paper notification 
  Research and Case Study Papers: Jan 9 - Artifact Submission 
  Jan 18 - Smoke-Test Deadline 
  Jan 25 - Main Review Phase starts 
  Feb 13 - Paper notification 
  Artifacts and Evaluation Criteria  
 An artifact is any additional material (software, data sets, machine-checkable proofs, etc.  ) that substantiates claims made in the paper and ideally renders them fully replicable. For example, an artifact might consist of a tool and its documentation, input files used for tool evaluation in the paper, and configuration files or documents describing parameters used in the experiments. The Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) will read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria:  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper 
  completeness 
  documentation and ease of use 
  availability in a permanent online repository 
  The evaluation will be based on the EAPLS guidelines  , and the AEC will decide which of the badges — among Functional, Reusable, and Available — will be assigned to a given artifact and added to the title page of the paper in case of acceptance.  
 Compulsory AE for Tool and Tool Demonstration Papers  
 Regular tool papers and tool demonstration papers are required to submit an artifact for evaluation by October 24 th  , 2024  . These artifacts will be expected to satisfy the requirements for the "Functional" and "Available" badges. Results of AE will be taken into consideration in the paper reviewing and rebuttal phase of TACAS 2025. Exemption from some aspects of AE is possible in exceptional circumstances, see Exemption  .  
 Optional AE for Research and Case Study Papers  
 Authors of research and case study papers are invited to submit an artifact no later than January 9 th  2025  , anywhere on Earth. Artifact submission is optional, and the artifact will be reviewed only after paper acceptance.  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifact submission is handled via EasyChair  . After the paper submission deadline, the paper submission will be copied by us from the main track to the artifact evaluation track. In this track, you should supply your submission's artifact abstract and upload a ZIP archive as supplementary material. Do not  attempt to create a new submission, nor change your submission's other details such as authors or title. Because of this copying process, you can upload or update your artifact either in the main track before the paper submission deadline, or in the AE track during a window before the deadline. The TACAS PC or AEC chairs will inform authors when the AE track is open for different paper categories.  
 An artifact submission must contain:  
 an abstract summarizing the artifact and its relation to the paper (entered in EasyChair) 
  a copy of the paper (already copied from the main track) 
  a ZIP archive (uploaded to EasyChair) containing: | a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact — it is required that the license at least allows the AEC to evaluate the artifact 
  instructions (README) including: | a hyperlink to the artifact 
  additional requirements for the artifact, such as installation of proprietary software or particular hardware resources 
  detailed instruction for an | early light review | that allows reviewers to: (1) verify that the artifact can properly run; and (2) perform a | short | evaluation of the artifact before the full evaluation and detect any difficulties (see | Rebuttal | ) 
  detailed instructions for use of the artifact and replication of results in the paper, including estimated resource use if non-trivial 
  The artifact hyperlink should point to a self-contained archive that allows the AEC to evaluate the artifact on the TACAS virtual machine OR docker image (see below for more information). Authors should test their artifact prior to the submission and include all relevant instructions. Instructions should be clear and specify every step required to build and run the artifact, assuming no specific knowledge and including steps that the authors might consider trivial. Ideally, there will be a single command to build the tool and a single command to run the experiments.  
 Guidelines for Artifacts  
 We expect artifact authors to package their artifact and write instructions such that AEC members can evaluate the artifact using the TACAS 2023 Artifact Evaluation Virtual Machine  (hereafter VM) for VirtualBox  . Note that this is not a misprint: we use the TACAS 2023 VM  as the AEC chairs consider it serviceable for TACAS 2025. The virtual machine is based on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  image with the following additional packages: build-essential, cmake, clang, mono-complete, openjdk-8-jdk, python3.10, pip3 ruby, and a 32-bit libc. VirtualBox guest additions are installed on the VM; it is therefore possible to connect a shared folder from the host computer.  
 NEW:  Instead of the VM, authors may also provide a Docker  image that can be run on the AEC's machine. Do not assume that all reviewers are familiar with Docker. Please provide explicit instructions on how to run the Docker image, including every complete command line arguments.  
 Your artifact is allowed reasonable network access, following a wider trend for software builds requiring network access. Authors can therefore decide whether to supply a completely self-contained artifact, rely on network access for external resources, or combine both. However, the main artifact described in the paper must be included in the archive, and use of external resources is at the author's own risk. If you are using external resources, please ensure that they are version pinned to ensure long-term replicability. We anticipate typical usage of this relaxation to be for the installation of third-party dependencies. The AEC chairs welcome feedback on this aspect, in particular questions about atypical artifacts. All the same, if the artifact requires additional software or libraries that are not part of the virtual machine the instructions must include all necessary steps for their installation and setup on a "clean" VM. In particular, authors should not rely on instructions provided by external tools. Again, the ideal setup is a single command to install the tool and all dependencies and a single command to run the experiments.  
 It is to the advantage of authors to prepare an artifact that is easy to evaluate by the AEC. Some guidelines:  
 Your artifact | need not be anonymized | , in contrast to your paper which must be anonymized. In particular, you | need not rename | your tool in both paper and artifact, even if it yields a potential loss of anonymity. For instance, if you submit a paper/artifact on a new tool called XYZ5 which has a clear connection to a tool called XYZ4 (and the authors of XYZ4 are publicly known) then you should keep calling your tool XYZ5 and do not hide a relationship with XYZ4. Your paper/artifact will not be rejected because of this. 
  Keep the evaluation process simple (e.g. through the use of scripts), and provide detailed documentation assuming minimum user expertise. 
  Document in detail how to replicate most, or ideally all, of the experimental results of the paper using the artifact. 
  State resource requirements and/or the environment in which you successfully tested the artifact. 
  For experiments requiring a large amount of resources, we strongly recommend providing a way to replicate a representative subset of results such that results can be reproduced on various hardware platforms in reasonable time. Do include the full set of experiments for those reviewers with sufficient hardware or time. 
  Do not submit a virtual machine | ; only submit your files, which AEC members will copy into the provided virtual machine. 
  For the "Available" badge, you must upload your artifact to a permanent repository (e.g. Zenodo, figshare, or Dryad) that provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and use that link in your submission. This excludes other repositories such as an institutional or personal website, source code hosting services, or cloud storage. 
  Please indicate which badges you are applying for in your submission. In particular, if you are not applying for the "Reusable" badge, please include a note to this end in your README file. 
  Members of the AEC will use the submitted artifact for the sole purpose of AE. We do, however, encourage authors to make their artifacts publicly and permanently available.  
 Please note that the reviewers will only have limited time to reproduce the experiments and they will likely use a machine that is different to yours. Again, if your experiments need a significant amount of time (more than a few hours), please prepare a representative subset of experiments that could be run in a shorter amount of time. It may be wise to test your artifact in the virtual machine running on other platforms available to you.  
 Exemption  
 Under particular conditions tool papers and tool demonstration papers may be exempted from submitting the artifact using the provided VM, or acquiring both the "Functional" and "Available" badges. Possible reasons for such exemptions include the need for special hardware (GPUs, compute clusters, robots, etc.  ), extreme resource requirements, or licensing issues. Artifacts should nonetheless be as complete as possible. Contact the AEC chairs as soon as possible if you anticipate the need for exemption.  
 Rebuttal  
 There will be no formal rebuttal procedure for AE. However, there will be an early light review of artifacts to ensure basic functionality: in case of technical issues at this stage and at the discretion of the AEC chairs, a single round  of rebuttal may be applied to some artifacts shortly after submission. A single set of questions from reviewers will be put to artifact authors, who may reply with a single set of answers to address issues and facilitate further evaluation. Update of the submitted files or further communication will not be allowed.

 With the rapid development and increasing complexity of computer systems and communication networks, user requirements for trust, security and privacy are becoming more and more demanding. Therefore, there is a grand challenge that traditional security technologies and measures may not meet user requirements in open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. As a result, we need to build systems and networks in which various applications allow users to enjoy more comprehensive services while preserving trust, security and privacy at the same time. As useful and innovative technologies, trusted computing and communications are attracting researchers with more and more attention.  
 The IEEE TrustCom-2023 (22nd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications) is a forum for presenting leading works on trusted computing and communications, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks.  
 The 22nd IEEE TrustCom follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE TrustCom conferences in the years from 2002 to 2022 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. TrustCom-2023 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoilt beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines.  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to TrustCom-2023. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

  INTRODUCTION    
 With the rapid development and increasing complexity of computer systems and communication networks, user requirements for trust, security and privacy are becoming more and more demanding. Therefore, there is a grand challenge that traditional security technologies and measures may not meet user requirements in open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. As a result, we need to build systems and networks in which various applications allow users to enjoy more comprehensive services while preserving trust, security and privacy at the same time. As useful and innovative technologies, trusted computing and communications are attracting researchers with more and more attention.  
 The IEEE TrustCom-2023 (22nd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications) is a forum for presenting leading works on trusted computing and communications, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks.  
 The 22nd IEEE TrustCom follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE TrustCom conferences in the years from 2002 to 2022 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. TrustCom-2023 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoilt beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines.  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to TrustCom-2023. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025)  
 July 14–19, 2025  
 Washington, DC and Online  
   
 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.  
 Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):  
 Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts) 
  Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data) 
  Scripts for data processing or simulations 
  Machine-generated proofs 
  Formal specifications 
  Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts) 
   
 Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of utility, and feedback is given to the authors. Issues considered include software bugs, readability of documentation and appropriate licensing. After your artifact has been approved by the committee, we will accompany the paper link on petsymposium.org  with a link to the artifact along with an artifact badge so that interested readers can find and use your artifact.

  About AUAI  
 The Association for Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence is a non-profit organization focused on organizing the annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence  (UAI) and, more generally, on promoting research in pursuit of advances in knowledge representation, learning and reasoning under uncertainty. The most recent UAI conference was the 40th conference, UAI-2024  held in Barcelona. Add yourself to the UAI Mailing list to keep updated on announcements and relevant AI news.  
 Principles and applications developed within the UAI community have been at the forefront of research in Artificial Intelligence. The UAI community and annual meeting have been primary sources of advances in graphical models for representing and reasoning with uncertainty.  
  Accessing Proceedings  
 The UAI conference has been held every year since 1985. Hardcopy versions of the proceedings can be purchased through Brightdoc  .  
 Most UAI conference papers are available in electronic form in the individual conference links and at arxiv  .  
 Collections of papers from the first six UAI conferences, 1985-1990 were published as edited books by North-Holland under the title Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (1-6) 
  Between 1991 and 2003, proceedings were published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers and were distributed at the conference by Morgan Kaufmann 
  Since 2004, the UAI proceedings have been published by the AUAI Press, the Association for Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence's own press. 
  Since 2020, the UAI proceedings have been published by Proceedings of Machine Learning Research ( | PMLR | ). 
   The UAI Mailing List  
 The UAI mailing list is for discussion of topics related to the representation and management of uncertain information especially but not exclusively as these issues arise within the context of Artificial Intelligence. This list also serves as a primary e-mail forum for the UAI community, as represented by those attending the Uncertainty in AI conference series, and for discussion of organizational matters related to that conference and to the community.  
 Postings discussing various uncertainty formalisms annoucements (and abstracts) of new tech-reports or journal articles or announcements of new public domain software are all fair game for this mailing list.

   David Heckerman      

 Distinguished Scientist, Amazon  
 E-mail:   heckerma@hotmail.com      Research activities    
 I am developing machine learning and statistical approaches for a variety of applications including genomics and vaccine design.  In my early work, I demonstrated the importance of probability theory in Artificial Intelligence, developed methods to build what are now called AI chatbots, and developed methods to learn graphical models from data including methods for causal discovery.    
    
 While at Microsoft, I developed numerous applications including machine-learning tools in SQL Server and Commerce Server, the junk-mail filters in Outlook, Exchange and Hotmail, handwriting recognition in the Tablet PC, text mining software in Sharepoint Portal Server, troubleshooters in Windows, and the Answer Wizard in Office.    
    
 See my technical memoir  about my work at Stanford and Microsoft Research. Included are fundamental concepts central to machine learning and artificial intelligence, applications of these concepts, and stories behind their creation.

 Individual privacy levels in query-based anonymization   
 Sascha Schiegg  (University of Passau, Germany), Florian Strohmeier  (University of Passau, Germany), Armin Gerl  (HM University of Applied Sciences Munich, Germany), Harald Kosch  (University of Passau, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 Artificial intelligence systems like large language models (LLM) source their knowledge from large datasets. Systems like ChatGPT therefore rely on shared data to train on. For enterprises, releasing data to the public domain requires anonymization as soon as a individual is identifiable. While multiple privacy models exist that guarantee a specific level of distortion applied to a dataset, to mitigate re-identification with e.g. k-anonymity, the required level is in general defined by the data processor. We propose the idea to combine individual privacy levels defined by the data subjects themselves with a privacy language such as LPL (Gerl et al., 2018) to get a more fine-granular understanding of the effectively required privacy level. Queries targeting subsets of the to be released dataset can only profit from lower privacy requirements set by data subjects as these response subsets may do not contain users with high privacy requirements, which can then lead to more utility. By analyzing the results of different queries directed at a privacy-aware data-transforming database system, we demonstrate the characteristics needed for this assumption to really take effect. For a more realistic evaluation we also take changes of the underlying data sources in consideration.

 Aligning eIDAS and Trust Over IP: A Mapping Approach   
 Cristian Lepore  (IRIT, France), Romain Laborde  (IRIT, France), Jessica Eynard  (Uniersity Toulouse Capitole, France)   
 Full Paper    

 On 29 February 2024, the European Parliament approved the amendment of the eIDAS Regulation. The revision introduces new elements and a new EU Digital Identity Wallet, expected to be ready by the end of 2026. Even after the wallet is released, the numerous digital identity schemes operating within the Member States will continue to function for some time. The introduction of the new wallet and the coexistence of numerous digital identity schemes will pose challenges for service providers, who will need to adapt to support various means of identity, including the EU wallet, for their services. In response to this challenge, this study examines how to plan interoperability between eIDAS and existing frameworks. First, we organize the eIDAS components in a knowledge graph that encodes information through entities and their relations. While doing this, we highlight various design patterns and use a graph entity alignment method to map components of eIDAS and the Trust Over IP.

 Full Paper    

 In parallel with the rapid development of Information and Communication technologies and the digitization of information in every aspect of daily life, the enforcement of the GDPR, in May 2018, brought significant changes to the processes that organisations should follow during collecting, processing, and storing personal data and revealed the immediate need for integrating the Regulation’s requirements for integrating into organisational activities that process personal and sensitive data. On the other hand, cloud computing is a cutting-edge technology that is widely used in order to support most, if not every, organisational activities. As a result, such infrastructure constitutes huge pools of personal data and, in this context, a careful consideration and implementation of the rules imposed by the Regulation is considered crucial. In this paper, after highlighting the need to consider the GDPR requirements when designing cloud-based systems, we determined those GDPR compliance controls that should be incorporated at the early stages of the system design process. As a next step, those compliance controls were integrated into a holistic framework that considers both the security and privacy aspects of a cloud-based system as well as the requirements arising from the Regulation during the design of such systems.

 A Framework for Managing Separation of Duty Policies   
 Sebastian Groll  (University of Regensburg, Germany), Sascha Kern  (Nexis GmbH, Germany), Ludwig Fuchs  (Nexis GmbH, Germany), Günther Pernul  (Universität Regensburg, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 Separation of Duty (SoD) is a fundamental principle in information security. Especially large and highly regulated companies have to manage a huge number of SoD policies. These policies need to be maintained in an ongoing effort in order to remain accurate and compliant with regulatory requirements. In this work we develop a framework for managing SoD policies that pays particular attention to policy comprehensibility. We conducted seven semi-structured interviews with SoD practitioners from large organizations in order to understand the requirements for managing and maintaining SoD policies. Drawing from the obtained insights, we developed a framework, which includes the relevant stakeholders and tasks, as well as a policy structure that aims to simplify policy maintenance. We anchor the proposed policy structure in a generic IAM data model to ensure compatibility and flexibility with other IAM models. We then show exemplary how our approach can be enforced within Role-Based Access Control. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework with a real-world IAM data set provided by a large finance company.

 Full Paper    

 In this paper, we present further contributions to the field of privacy-preserving and explainable data analysis applied to tabular datasets. Our approach defines a comprehensive optimization criterion that balances the key aspects of data privacy, model explainability, and data utility. By carefully regulating the privacy parameter and exploring various configurations, our methodology identifies the optimal trade-off that maximizes privacy gain and explainability similarity while minimizing any adverse impact on data utility. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using five classifiers on a binary classification problem using the well-known Adult dataset, which contains sensitive attributes. We employed (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy with generative adversarial networks as a privacy mechanism and incorporated various model explanation methods. The results showcase the capabilities of our approach in achieving the dual objectives of preserving data privacy and generating model explanations.

 Article 45 of the eIDAS Directive Unveils the need to implement the X.509 4-cornered trust model for the WebPKI   
 Ahmad Samer Wazan  (Zayed University, United Arab Emirates), Romain Laborde  (Université Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, France), Abdelmalek Benzekri  (Université Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, France), Imran Taj  (Zayed University, United Arab Emirates)   
 Full Paper    

 Article 45 of the new eIDAS Directive (eIDAS 2.0) is causing a bit of shock on the Internet as it gives European governments the power to make EU-certificated web certificates accepted without the approval of web browsers/OS, which are considered to be the current gatekeepers of the WebPKI ecosystem. This paper goes beyond the current debate between the WebPKI gatekeepers and the European Commission (EC) about the implications of Article 45. It shows how both approaches do not provide full protection to web users. We propose a better approach that Europe can follow to regulate web X.509 certificates: Rather than regulating the issuance of web X.509 certificates, the EC can play the role of a validator that recommends the acceptance of certificates at the web scale.

 Create, Read, Update, Delete: Implications on Security and Privacy Principles regarding GDPR   
 Michail Pantelelis  (University of the Aegean, Greece), Christos Kalloniatis  (Department of Cultural Technology and Communication-University of the Aegean, Greece)   
 Full Paper    

 Create, Read, Update and Delete operations (CRUD) are a well-established abstraction to model data access in software systems of different architectures. Most system requirements, generated during the specification phase, will be realized by combining these operations on different entities of the system under development. The majority of these requirements will be business operations and objectives. Security requirements come on top of business requirements in a mostly network-connected world and risk the existence of a software system as a business. Through the enforcement of privacy laws, modern systems must also legally comply with privacy requirements or face the possibility of high fines. While there is a great interest in methodologies to elicit security and privacy requirements, little has been done to practically apply those requirements during the software development phase. This paper investigates the implication of those four basic operations regarding security and privacy principles as they are implied by the law. Analysis findings aim to raise awareness among developers about privacy when implementing high-level business requirements, and result in a bottom-up compliance procedure regarding privacy and the GDPR by proposing a systematic approach in this direction.

 The Trade-off Between Privacy & Quality for Counterfactual Explanations

 Full Paper    

 Counterfactual explanations are a promising direction of explainable AI in many domains such as healthcare. These explanations produce a counterexample from the dataset that shows, for example, what should change about a patient to reduce their risk of developing diabetes type 2. However, this poses a clear privacy risk when the dataset contains information about people. Recent literature shows that this risk can be mitigated by using $k$-anonymity to generalise the explanation, such that it is not about a single person. In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between privacy and explanation quality in the medical domain. Our results show that for around 40\% of the explained cases, the real gain in privacy is limited as the generalisation increases while the explanations continue decreasing in quality.  
   
  These findings suggest that this can be an unsuitable strategy in some situations, as its effectiveness depends on characteristics of the underlying dataset.

 Deployment of Cybersecurity Controls in the Norwegian Industry 4.0   
 Kristian Kannelønning  (NTNU, Norway), Sokratis Katsikas  (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway)   
 Full Paper    

 Cybersecurity threats and attacks on Industry are increasing, and the outcome of a successful cyber-attack can be severe for organizations. A successful cyber-attack on an Industry where Cyber-Physical Systems are present can be particularly devastating as such systems could cause harm to people and the environment if they malfunction. This paper reports on the results of a survey investigating what security measures organizations implement within the industry to strengthen their security posture. The survey instrument used has been developed using the NIST Special Publication "Guide to Operational Technology" and contained 70 questions to determine the level of security controls deployed within the Norwegian Industry. The results show that the average usage of the different security controls is 63%, and 53% of the organizations have a security controls usage of 60% or more. The most used security control is backup of critical software, whereas the two least used are specific-OT cybersecurity training and response planning. Both are highlighted as areas for improvement. Dedicated OT security standards have not been found to influence the level of security controls used. However, employees within an organization following a dedicated security standard have higher cybersecurity knowledge.

 Trust-minimizing BDHKE-based e-cash mint using secure hardware and distributed computation   
 Antonín Dufka  (Masaryk University, Czechia), Jakub Janků  (Masaryk University, Czechia), Petr Švenda  (Masaryk University, Czechia)   
 Full Paper    

 The electronic cash (or e-cash) technology based on the foundational work of Chaum is emerging as a scalability and privacy layer atop of expensive and traceable blockchain-based currencies. Unlike trustless blockchains, e-cash designs inherently rely on a trusted party with full control over the currency supply. Since this trusted component cannot be eliminated from the system, we aim to minimize the trust it requires.  
   
  We approach this goal from two angles. Firstly, we employ misuse-resistant hardware to mitigate the risk of compromise via physical access to the trusted device. Secondly, we divide the trusted device's capabilities among multiple independent devices, in a way that ensures unforgeability of its currency as long as at least a single device remains uncompromised. Finally, we combine both these approaches to leverage their complementary benefits.  
   
  In particular, we surveyed blind protocols used in e-cash designs with the goal of identifying those suitable for misuse-resistant, yet resource-constrained devices. Based on the survey, we focused on the BDHKE-based construction suitable for the implementation on devices with limited resources. Next, we proposed a new multi-party protocol for distributing the operations needed in BDHKE-based e-cash and analyzed its security. Finally, we implemented the protocol for the JavaCard platform and demonstrated the practicality of the approach by measuring its performance on a physical smartcard.

 The importance of automotive cybersecurity is increasing in tandem with the evolution of more complex vehicles, fueled by trends like V2X or over-the-air updates. Regulatory bodies are trying to cope with this problem with the introduction of ISO 21434, which standardizes automotive cybersecurity engineering. One piece of the puzzle for compliant cybersecurity engineering is the creation of a TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. The more time security experts invest in creating a TARA, the more detailed and mature it becomes. Thus, organizations must balance the benefits of a more mature TARA against the costs and resources required to achieve it. However, there is a lack of guidance on determining the appropriate level of effort. In this paper, we propose a data-driven maturity model as a management utility facilitating the decision on the maturity-cost trade-off for creating TARAs. To evaluate the model, we conducted interviews with seven automotive cybersecurity experts from the industry.

 Full Paper    

 Several security issues in open-source projects demonstrate that developer accounts get misused or stolen if weak authentication is used. Many services have started to enforce second-factor authentication (2FA) for their users. This is also the case for GitHub, the largest open-source development platform. We surveyed 110 open-source developers in GitHub to explore how they perceive the importance of authentication on GitHub. Our participants perceived secure authentication as important as other security mechanisms (e.g., commit signing) to improve open-source security. 2FA usage of the project owner was perceived as one of the most important mechanisms.  
   
  Around half of the participants (51%) were aware of the planned 2FA enforcement on GitHub. Their perception of this enforcement was rather positive. They agreed to enforce 2FA for new devices and new locations, but they were slightly hesitant to use it after some time. They also rather agreed to enforce various user groups on GitHub to use 2FA. Our participants also perceived GitHub authentication methods positively with respect to their usability and security. Most of our participants (68%) reported that they had enabled 2FA on their GitHub accounts.

 Full Paper    

 Trust is crucial when a truster allows a trustee to carry out desired services. Regulatory authorities thus set requirements for organizations under their jurisdiction to ensure a basic trust level. Trusted auditors periodically verify the auditee's compliance with these requirements. However, the quality of the auditees' compliance and the auditors' verification performance often remain unclear and unavailable to the public. In this work, we examine the regulations of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and identify typical patterns. We enhance these patterns to include trust measurements for the auditee providing services and the auditors verifying compliance. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for an application utilizing decentralized blockchain technologies and discuss the implications, potential, and benefits of this architecture.

 In order to perform cutting-edge research like AI model training, a large amount of data needs to be accessed. However, data providers are often reluctant to share their data with researchers as these might contain personal data and thereby sharing may introduce serious risks with significant personal, institutional or societal impacts. Apart from the need to control these risks, data providers must also comply with regulations like GDPR, which creates an additional overhead that makes data sharing even less appealing to data providers. Technologies like anonymization can play a critical role when sharing data that may contain personal information by offering privacy preservation measures like face or license plate anonymization. Therefore, we propose a framework to support data sharing of personal data for research by integrating anonymization, risk assessment and automatic licence agreement generation. The framework offers a practical and efficient solution for organisations seeking to enhance data-sharing practices without compromising information security.

 Full Paper    

 Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are widely deployed today and often use wireless communication. Establishing a secure communication channel to these devices is challenging in practice. To address this issue, researchers have proposed IMD key exchange protocols, particularly ones that leverage an Out-Of-Band (OOB) channel such as audio, vibration and physiological signals. While these solutions have advantages over traditional key exchange, they are often proposed in an ad-hoc manner and lack a systematic evaluation of their security, usability and deployability properties. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of existing OOB-based solutions for IMDs and, based on our findings, propose a novel IMD key exchange protocol that includes a new class of OOB channel based on human bodily motions. We implement prototypes and validate our designs through a user study (N = 24). The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and its unique features, establishing a new direction in the context of IMD security.

 Full Paper    

 Federated learning eliminates the necessity of transferring private training data and instead relies on the aggregation of model updates. Several publications on privacy attacks show how these individual model updates are vulnerable to the extraction of sensitive information. State-of-the-art secure aggregation protocols provide privacy for participating clients, yet, they are restrained by high computation and communication overhead.  
   
  We propose the efficient secure aggregation protocol DealSecAgg. The cryptographic scheme is based on a lightweight single-masking approach and allows the aggregation of the global model under encryption. DealSecAgg utilizes at least one additional dealer party to outsource the aggregation of masks and to reduce the computational complexity for mobile clients. At the same time, our protocol is scalable and resilient against client dropouts.  
   
  We provide a security proof and experimental results regarding the performance of DealSecAgg. The experimental evidence on the CIFAR-10 data set confirms that using our protocol, model utility remains unchanged compared to federated learning without secure aggregation. Furthermore, the results show how our work outperforms other state-of-the-art masking strategies both in the number of communication rounds per training step and in computational costs, which grows linearly in the amount of active clients. By employing our protocol, runtimes can be reduced by up to 87.8% compared to related work.

 21st International Workshop on Trust, Privacy and Security in the Digital Society to be held in conjunction with the 19th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security   
   
 New computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, big data or the Internet of Things, open new horizons to citizens, businesses and our whole society worldwide. All these developments ultimately aim to improve our quality of life, make it easier to generate wealth, and ensure that businesses remain competitive in the global marketplace. These developments have been made possible in a remarkably short time span because information and communication technologies move fast; sometimes, they move too fast for society and governments. This explains why such rapid technological evolutions cannot be problem-free. In the domain of a digital society, concerns are raised regarding the lack of trust in electronic procedures and the extent to which information security and user privacy can be ensured.  

  The TrustBus series of conferences has a long tradition going back as an annual event to 2004. In answer to the concerns mentioned above, the 21 st  edition of the International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Digital Society (TrustBus 2024) will be held as an ARES 2024 workshop. It will provide an international forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange information regarding advancements in the state of the art and practice of trust and privacy in the digital society. TrustBus 2024 will bring together researchers from different disciplines, developers, and users, all interested in the critical success factors of the technical advances of our digital systems.

 Digital Forensic Artifacts of FIDO2 Passkeys in Windows 11   
 Patricio Domingues  (Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal), Miguel Frade  (Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal), Miguel Negrao  (Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal)   
 Full Paper    

 FIDO2's passkey aims to provide a passwordless authentication solution. It relies on two main protocols -- WebAuthn and CTAP2 -- for authentication in computer systems, relieving users from the burden of using and managing passwords.  
   
  FIDO2's passkey leverages asymmetric cryptography to create a unique public/private key pair for website authentication. While the public key is kept at the website/application, the private key is created and stored on the authentication device designated as the authenticator. The authenticator can be the computer itself -- same-device signing --, or another device -- cross-device signing --, such as an Android smartphone that connects to the computer through a short-range communication method (NFC, Bluetooth).  
   
  Authentication is performed by the user unlocking the authenticator device.  
   
  In this paper, we report on the digital forensic artifacts left on Windows 11 systems by registering and using passkeys to authenticate on websites. We show that digital artifacts are created in Windows Registry and Windows Event Log.  
   
  These artifacts enable the precise dating and timing of passkey registration, as well as the usage and identification of the websites on which they have been activated and utilized. We also identify digital artifacts created when Android smartphones are registered and used as authenticators in a Windows system. This can prove useful in detecting the existence of smartphones linked to a given individual.

 Short Paper    

 Modern vehicles such as cars, ships, and planes are increasingly managed using Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that communicate over a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. While this approach offers enhanced functionality, efficiency, and robustness against electric disturbances and electronic interference, it may also be used for unforeseen or malicious purposes ranging from aftermarket modifications to full-fledged attacks threatening the passengers' safety. The ability to conduct in-depth tests is thus vital to protect against these issues. However, much of the functionality of ECUs is proprietary or undocumented. To alleviate this obstacle, this work presents a reverse engineering approach using high-coverage test sets produced using combinatorial testing (CT) methods. Our results indicate that this technique is promising for exciting unknown functionality, although challenges regarding the presence of hidden state and high-accuracy oracles are yet to be overcome.  

 Prov2vec: Learning Provenance Graph Representation for Anomaly Detection in Computer Systems

 Full Paper    

 Modern cyber attackers use advanced zero-day exploits, highly targeted spear phishing, and other social engineering techniques to gain access and also use evasion techniques to maintain a prolonged presence within the victim network while working gradually towards the objective. To minimize the damage, it is necessary to detect these Advanced Persistent Threat as early in the campaign as possible. This paper proposes, Prov2vec, a system for the continuous monitoring of enterprise host's behavior to detect attackers' activities.  
   
  It leverages the data provenance graph built using system event logs to get complete visibility into the execution state of an enterprise host and the causal relationship between system entities. It proposes a novel provenance graph kernel to obtain the canonical representation of the system behavior, which is compared against its historical behaviors and that of other hosts to detect the deviation from the norm. These representations are used in several machine learning models to evaluate their ability to capture the underlying behavior of an endpoint host. We have empirically demonstrated that the provenance graph kernel produces a much more compact representation compared to existing methods while improving prediction ability.

 Modern malware increasingly deploys network covert channels to prevent detection or bypass firewalls. Unfortunately, discovering in advance fields and functional behaviors of protocols that can be abused for cloaking information is difficult. In this perspective, fuzz testing could represent a valuable approach to face the tight relationship between the used hiding scheme and the targeted protocol trait.  
   
  Therefore, this paper explores whether basic fuzzing techniques can be effective to quantify the "susceptibility" of ubiquitous HTTP conversations against information hiding attempts. To this aim, we conducted a thorough test campaign considering three different covert channels hidden in traffic exchanged with 1,000 real Web destinations. Results indicate that fuzzing should be considered a valid technique to investigate how HTTP can be altered to cloak data and to define the theoretical limits of covert channels when deployed in the Internet.  

 HeMate: Enhancing Heap Security through Isolating Primitive Types with Arm Memory Tagging Extension

 Full Paper    

 Memory safety vulnerabilities are a significant challenge for programming languages like C and C++. Among these vulnerabilities, heap-based issues have become more prevalent in recent years. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows adversaries to execute arbitrary memory reads, writes, and even code execution. The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), introduced in the Arm v8.5-A processor architecture, is an example of such a security feature. MTE has been utilized in modern software to implement probabilistic protection for heap-based memory safety vulnerabilities, including use-after-free and heap-based buffer overflow. However, the existing MTE-based approaches offer probabilistic protection and are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Moreover, these approaches offer inter-object isolation but are vulnerable to intra-object overflow. These shortcomings leave opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities.  
   
  Adversaries tend to leverage memory confusion to manipulate or leak pointers, leading to arbitrary memory read/write and code execution. In response to this observation, we propose a novel usage of MTE, called HeMate, to isolate memory storing different types of data on the heap to prevent such exploitation. This approach provides a non-probabilistic constraint on vulnerability exploitation. We have implemented a HeMate prototype compiler for C language programs based on the LLVM framework. Our approach effectively leverages MTE to protect against intra-object overflow vulnerabilities and brute-force attacks that previous approaches offer no protection.

 Diverse, correct, and up-to-date training environments are instrumental for training cybersecurity experts and autonomous systems alike. However, their preparation is time-consuming and requires experts to supply detailed specifications. In this paper we explore the challenges of automated generation of key elements of such environments: complex attack plans – scenarios – that lead to a user-defined adversary goal, and infrastructure specifications – terrains – that enable the attack plan to be executed.  
   
  We propose new models to represent the cybersecurity domain and associated action spaces. These models are used to create sound and complex scenarios and terrains, based on partial specifications provided by users. We compare the results with a real-world complex malware campaign scenario to assess the realism of the produced scenarios. To further evaluate the correctness and variability of the results, we utilize the killchain attack graph generation to distill attack graphs for generated terrains and compare them with the respective scenarios to assess correct correspondence in generated scenario-terrain pairs.  
   
  Our results demonstrate that our approach is able to create terrains and non-linear scenarios of complexity similar to advanced malware campaigns. Further quantitative evaluation shows that the generated terrains represent their respective scenarios, as evaluated with attack graph analysis, regardless of terrain and scenario size.  
   
  To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach and its implementation represent a significant leap in the state of the art and enable novel approaches to cybersecurity training and autonomous system development.

 While secure multi-party computation (MPC) protects privacy of the inputs and intermediate values, it has to be combined with differential privacy (DP) to protect the privacy of the outputs. For this reason, MPC is used to generate noise and add this noise to the output.} However, securely generating and adding this noise is a challenge considering real-world implementations on finite-precision computers, since many DP mechanisms guarantee privacy only when noise is sampled from continuous distributions requiring infinite precision.  
   
  We introduce efficient MPC protocols that securely realize noise sampling for several plaintext DP mechanisms that are secure against existing precision-based attacks: the discrete Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, the snapping mechanism, and the integer-scaling Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms. Due to their inherent trade-offs, the favorable mechanism for a specific application depends on the available computation resources, type of function evaluated, and desired (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantee.  
   
  The benchmarks of our protocols implemented in the state-of-the-art MPC framework MOTION (Braun et al., TOPS'22) demonstrate highly efficient online runtimes of less than 32 ms/query and down to about 1ms/query with batching in the two-party setting. Also the respective offline phases are practical, requiring only 51 ms to 5.6 seconds/query depending on the batch size.

 Data processors increasingly rely on external data sources to improve strategic or operational decision taking. Data owners can facilitate this by releasing datasets directly to data processors or doing so indirectly via data spaces. As data processors often have different needs and due to the sensitivity of the data, multiple anonymized versions of an original dataset are often released. However, doing so can introduce severe privacy risks.  
   
  This paper demonstrates the emerging privacy risks when curious -- potentially colluding -- service providers obtain an identity-reserved and aggregated k-anonymous version of the same dataset. We build a mathematical model of the attack and demonstrate its applicability in the presence of attackers with different goals and computing power. The model is applied to a real world scenario and countermeasures are presented to mitigate the attack.  

 Let Them Drop: Scalable and Efficient Federated Learning Solutions Agnostic to Stragglers

 Secure Aggregation (SA) stands as a crucial component in modern Federated Learning (FL) systems, facilitating collaborative training of a global machine learning model while protecting the privacy of individual clients' local datasets. Many existing SA protocols described in the FL literature operate synchronously, leading to notable runtime slowdowns due to the presence of stragglers (i.e. late-arriving clients).  
   
  To address this challenge, one common approach is to consider stragglers as client failures and use SA solutions that are robust against dropouts. While this approach indeed seems to work, it unfortunately affects the performance of the protocol as its cost strongly depends on the dropout ratio and this ratio has increased significantly when taking stragglers into account.  
   
  Another approach explored in the literature to address stragglers is to introduce asynchronicity into the FL system. Very few SA solutions exist in this setting and currently suffer from high overhead.  
   
  In this paper, similar to related work, we propose to handle stragglers as client failures but design SA solutions that do not depend on the dropout ratio so that an unavoidable increase on this metric does not affect the performance of the solution. We first introduce Eagle, a synchronous SA scheme designed not to depend on the client failures but on the online users' inputs only. This approach offers better computation and communication costs compared to existing solutions under realistic settings where the number of stragglers is high.  
   
  We then propose Owl, the first SA solution that is suitable for the asynchronous setting and once again considers online clients' contributions only.  
   
  We implement both solutions and show that: (i) in a synchronous FL with realistic dropout rates (that takes potential stragglers into account), Eagle outperforms the best SA solution, namely Flamingo, by X4; (ii) In the asynchronous setting, Owl exhibits the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art solution LightSecAgg.

 In recent years, digital services have experienced significant growth, exemplified by platforms like Netflix achieving unprecedented revenue levels. Some of these services employ subscription models, with certain content requiring additional payments or offering third-party products. To ensure the widespread availability of diverse digital services anytime and anywhere, providers must have control over content accessibility. To address the multifaceted challenges in this domain, one promising solution is the adoption of attribute-based encryption (ABE). Over the years, various approaches have been proposed in the literature, offering a wide range of features. In a prior study [Annonymised source], we assessed the security of one of these proposed approaches and identified one that did not meet its promised security standards. In this research we focuses on conducting a security analysis for another ABE scheme to pinpoint its shortcomings and emphasize the critical importance of evaluating the safety and effectiveness of newly proposed schemes. Specifically, we uncover an attack vector within this ABE scheme, which enables malicious users to decrypt content without the required permissions or attributes. Furthermore, we propose a solution to rectify this identified vulnerability.  

 A Large-Scale Study on the Prevalence and Usage of TEE-based Features on Android

 Full Paper    

 In the realm of mobile security, where OS-based protections have proven insufficient against robust attackers, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a hardware-based security technology. Despite the industry's persistence in advancing TEE technology, the impact on end users and developers remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of TEE utilization in Android applications, focusing on the key areas of cryptography, digital rights management, biometric authentication, and secure dialogs.  
   
  To facilitate our extensive analysis, we introduce Mobsec Analytika, a framework tailored for large-scale app examinations, which we make available to the research community. Through 333,475 popular Android apps, our analysis illuminates the implementation of TEE-related features and their contextual usage.  
   
  Our findings reveal that TEE features are predominantly utilized indirectly through third-party libraries, with only 6.2% of apps directly invoking the APIs. Moreover, the study reveals the underutilization of the recent TEE-based UI feature Protected Confirmation.  

 SoK: A Comparison of Autonomous Penetration Testing Agents

 Sok Paper    

 In the still growing field of cyber security, machine learning methods have largely been employed for detection tasks. Only a small portion revolves around offensive capabilities. Through the rise of Deep Reinforcement Learning, agents have also emerged with the goal of actively assessing the security of systems by the means of penetration testing. Thus learning the usage of different tools to emulate humans. In this paper we present an overview, and comparison of different autonomous penetration testing agents found within the literature. Various agents have been proposed, making use of distinct methods, but several factors such as modelling of the environment and scenarios, different algorithms, and the difference in chosen methods themselves, make it difficult to draw conclusions on the current state and performance of those agents. This comparison also lets us identify research challenges that present a major limiting factor, such as handling large action spaces, partial observability, defining the right reward structure, and learning in a real-world scenario.

 As of today exposure and remediation technologies are mainly validated by taking the attacker's perspective. This paradigm is often referred to as "Know Your Enemy", it enables a realistic assessment of the actual attack surface of your IT infrastructure. Furthermore, the operational environment is becoming increasingly dynamic and complex, hence a flexible and adaptable reaction to the tactics, techniques, and procedures of cyber attackers must be implemented. In this work, we present a concept and a prototypical proof of concept, which take both aspects into account. More precisely we present a simulation-based approach in the scope of data exfiltration, which improves anticipation of the attacker's perspective and thus puts effective and adapted strategies into place. As sample use cases of data exfiltration techniques, we shed light on recent techniques like abuse of scheduled tasks, which presumably will become of increasing importance in the future. Our prototype makes use of common open-source software and can thus be implemented easily. During our evaluation, we simulate relevant sections of our sample attack vectors using test data and derive options for detection and protection against the respective simulated attack. Finally, we expound on the integration of our proposed technical and organisational measures into an existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) as part of a process for continuous improvement.  

 Sybil Attack Strikes Again: Denying Content Access in IPFS with a Single Computer   
 Thibault Cholez  (University of Lorraine, CNRS, Inria, LORIA, France), Claudia Ignat  (University of Lorraine, CNRS, Inria, LORIA, France)   
 Short Paper    

 The Distributed Hash Table architecture is known to be a very efficient way to implement peer-to-peer (P2P) computer networks, but the scientific literature also proved that they can be easily disrupted by a single entity controlling many peers, known as the Sybil Attack. Various defensive mechanisms are known to prevent such attacks, or at least hinder them. The current study evaluates the resiliency of the IPFS P2P network to a legacy Sybil Attack. We show that, surprisingly, IPFS does not implement any defense mechanism, allowing the most simple attack from a single computer to easily take the control of any DHT entry. A practical use of this attack is to almost entirely deny access to a given content on the network. Thus we provide some recommendations to quickly remediate this vulnerability.

 Continuous Authentication (CA) mechanisms involve managing sensitive data from users which may change over time. Both requirements (privacy and adapting to new users) lead to a tension in the amount and granularity of the data at stake. However, no previous work has addressed them together. This paper proposes a CA approach that leverages incremental Matrix Profile (MP) and Deep Learning using accelerometer data. Results show that MP is effective for CA purposes, leading to 99% of accuracy when a single user is authorized. Besides, the model can on-the-fly increase the set of authorized users up to 10 while offering similar accuracy rates. The amount of input data is also characterized -- the last 15 s. of data in the user device require 0.4 MB of storage and lead to a CA accuracy of 97% even with 10 authorized users.

 This paper presents an investigation of nucleotide sequencing based random number generators, refutation of naive approaches to this problem, and a novel random number generator design based on the characteristics of nucleotide sequencers such as the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION.  
   
  Common issues include misunderstanding the statistical properties of nucleotide sequences and the provenance of entropy observed in post-processed sequences extracted from such data. We identify that the use of sequences, expressed as base-pair (ACGT) sequences, for random number generation is not possible. The process by which such sequences are observed and reported by scientific instrumentation, provide a means by which entropy associated with nucleotide sequences (or more correctly the act of observing and recording them) can be observed.  
   
  We report a novel method of extracting entropy from the process of reading nucleotide sequences, as opposed to the nucleotide sequences themselves. We overcome the limitations and inherent bias of nucleotide sequences, to provide a source of randomness decoupled from biological data and records. A novel random number generator drawing on entropy extracted from nucleotide sequencing is presented with validation of its performance and characteristics.  

 Hardware Trust Anchor Authentication for Updatable IoT Devices

 Full Paper    

 Secure firmware update mechanisms and Hardware Trust Anchors (HTAs) are crucial in securing future IoT networks. Among others, HTAs can be used to shield security-sensitive data like cryptographic keys from unauthorized access, using hardware isolation. Authentication mechanisms for key usage, however, are difficult to implement since corresponding credentials need to be stored outside the HTA. This makes them vulnerable against host hijacking attacks, which in the end also undermines the security gains of the HTA deployment.  
   
  This paper introduces an update-resilient and secure HTA authentication mechanism that secures the HTA authentication credentials on the host. Our concept is based on an integration of the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE), a Trusted Computing standard for resource-constrained off-the-shelf devices, with signed update manifest documents. This secures HTA authentication credentials, but also provides value for DICE-based devices without an HTA. We evaluate the feasibility of our solution based on a proof-of-concept implementation.  

 A Privacy Measure Turned Upside Down? Investigating the Use of HTTP Client Hints on the Web

 HTTP client hints are a set of standardized HTTP request headers designed to modernize and potentially replace the traditional user agent string. While the user agent string exposes a wide range of information about the client's browser and device, client hints provide a controlled and structured approach for clients to selectively disclose their capabilities and preferences to servers. Essentially, client hints aim at more effective and privacy-friendly disclosure of browser or client properties than the user agent string.  
   
  We present a first long-term study of the use of HTTP client hints in the wild. We found that despite being implemented in almost all web browsers, server-side usage of client hints remains generally low. However, in the context of third-party websites, which are often linked to trackers, the adoption rate is significantly higher. This is concerning because client hints allow the retrieval of more data from the client than the user agent string provides, and there are currently no mechanisms for users to detect or control this potential data leakage. Our work provides valuable insights for web users, browser vendors, and researchers by exposing potential privacy violations via client hints and providing help in developing remediation strategies as well as further research.   

 Comparative Analysis and Implementation of Jump Address Masking for Preventing TEE Bypassing Fault Attacks

 Full Paper    

 Attacks on embedded devices continue to evolve with the increasing number of applications in actual products. A trusted execution environment (TEE) enhances the security of embedded devices by isolating and protecting sensitive applications such as cryptography from malicious or vulnerable applications. However, the emergence of TEE bypass attacks using faults exposes TEEs to threats. In CHES’22, jump address masking (JAM) was proposed as a countermeasure against TEE bypass attacks, specifically targeting RISC-V. JAM prevents modifications of protected data by calculating jump addresses using the protected data, and is expected to provide promising resistance to TEE bypass attacks, for which traditional countermeasures are ineffective. However, JAM was originally proposed for bare metal applications. Therefore, its application to TEEs that operate with an OS presents technical and security challenges. This study proposes a method for applying JAM to Keystone, a major TEE framework for RISC-V, and validates its practical effectiveness and performance through a comparative evaluation with existing countermeasures such as memory encryption, random delays, and instruction duplication. Our evaluation reveals that the proposed JAM implementation is the first countermeasure that achieves complete resistance to TEE bypass attacks with an execution time overhead of approximately 340% for context switches and 1.0% across the entire program, which is acceptable compared with other countermeasures.

 Implementations of network protocols must conform to their specifications in order to avoid security vulnerabilities and interoperability issues. To detect errors, testing must investigate an implementation's response to a wide range of inputs, including those that could be supplied by an attacker. This can be achieved by symbolic execution, but its application in testing network protocol implementations has so far been limited. One difficulty when testing such implementations is that the inputs and requirements for processing a packet depend on the sequence of previous packets. We present a novel technique to encode protocol requirements by monitors, and then employ symbolic execution to detect violations of these requirements in protocol implementations. A monitor is a component external to the SUT, that observes a sequence of packets exchanged between protocol parties, maintains information about the state of the interaction, and can thereby detect requirement violations. Using monitors, requirements for stateful network protocols can be tested with a wide variety of inputs, without intrusive modifications in the source code of the SUT. We have applied our technique on the most recent versions of several widely-used DTLS and QUIC protocol implementations, and have been able to detect twenty two previously unknown bugs in them, twenty one of which have already been fixed and the remaining one has been confirmed.

 Today, it is possible to perform external anomaly detection by analyzing the involuntary EM emanations of digital device components. However, one of the most important challenges of these methods is the manual collection of EM signals for fingerprinting. Indeed, this procedure must be conducted by a human expert and requires high precision. In this work, we introduce a framework that alleviates this requirement by relying on synthetic EM signals that have been generated from the assembly code. The signals are produced through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. Experimentally, we identify that the synthetic EM signals are extremely similar to the real and thus, can be used for training anomaly detection models effectively. Through experimental assessments, we prove that the anomaly detection models are capable of recognizing even minute alterations to the code with high accuracy.

 Sensors embedded in mobile smart devices can monitor users' activity with high accuracy to provide a variety of services to end-users ranging from precise geolocation, health monitoring, and handwritten word recognition. However, this involves the risk of accessing and potentially disclosing sensitive information of individuals to the apps that may lead to privacy breaches. In this paper, we aim to minimize privacy leakages that may lead to user identification on mobile devices through user tracking and distinguishability while preserving the functionality of apps and services. We propose a privacy-preserving mechanism that effectively handles the sensor data fluctuations (e.g., inconsistent sensor readings while walking, sitting, and running at different times) by formulating the data as time-series modeling and forecasting. The proposed mechanism uses the notion of correlated noise-series against noise filtering attacks from an adversary, which aims to filter out the noise from the perturbed data to re-identify the original data. Unlike existing solutions, our mechanism keeps running in isolation without the interaction of a user or a service provider. We perform rigorous experiments on three benchmark datasets and show that our proposed mechanism limits user tracking and distinguishability threats to a significant extent compared to the original data while maintaining a reasonable level of utility of functionalities. In general, we show that our obfuscation mechanism reduces the user trackability threat by 60% across all the datasets while maintaining the utility loss below 0.3 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). More specifically, we observe that 80% of users achieve a 100% untrackability rate in the Swipes dataset across all noise scales. In the handwriting dataset, distinguishability is 17% for 60% of the users. Overall, our mechanism provides a utility error (MAE) of only 0.12 for 60% of users, and this increases to 0.2 for 100% users when correction thresholds are altered.

 The domain name system (DNS) maps human-readable service names to IP addresses used by the network. As it exerts control over where users are directed to, domain names have been targets of abuse ever since the Internet become a success. Over the past twenty years, adversaries have repeated invented new strategies to trick users and our findings reveal a continuous increase in the exploitation of domain names.  
   
  Aside from educating users, it is foremost the responsibility of organizations to monitor for or proactively register domain names with abuse potential. This however requires organizations to be aware and translate this into concrete action. While the typo-related attacks of the early 2000s are self-explanatory, other types of domain attacks are not. In this paper, we investigate the level of organizational awareness and preparedness towards two types of DNS abuse, and analyze the reaction and protection response of 300 large organizations over the course of 7 years. We find that large companies take little action towards this threat, with the exception of few well-prepared organizations. We validate these findings in an interview study with security experts of 12 large organizations and discover that this lack of preparation is the result of insufficient resources and a clear preference for reaction to incidents instead of prevention.

 Existing Federated Learning (FL) methods are highly influenced by the training data distribution. In the single global model FL systems, users with highly non-IID data do not improve the global model, and neither does the global model work well on their local data distribution. Even with the clustering-based FL approaches, not all participants get clustered adequately enough for the models to fulfill their local demands. In this work, we design a modified subjective logic-based FL system utilizing the distribution-based similarity among users. Each participant has complete control over their own aggregated model, with handpicked contributions from other participants. The existing clustered model only satisfies a subset of clients, while our individual aggregated models satisfy all the clients. We design a decentralized FL approach, which functions without a trusted central server; the communication and computation overhead is distributed among the clients. We also develop a layer-wise secret-sharing scheme to amplify privacy. We experimentally show that our approach improves the performance of each participant's aggregated model on their local distribution over the existing single global model and clustering-based approach.  

 Let the Users Choose: Low Latency or Strong Anonymity? Investigating Mix Nodes with Paired Mixing Techniques

 Current anonymous communication systems force users to choose between strong anonymity with significant delay or low latency with unreliable anonymity. That divides users across systems based on their requirements, leading to smaller user bases and reduced anonymity. To address this, we propose an approach based on mix networks, that employs two mixing techniques on mix nodes: threshold mixing for users valuing strong anonymity and timed or continuous-time mixing for those with specific latency constraints. We conducted an in-depth empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposal offers enhanced anonymity for all users while meeting the latency requirements for those who prioritize that. It further outperforms using single mixing techniques on the mix node, even when considering the same user base size. Moreover, our findings indicate that our proposal eliminates the need for generating cover traffic to enhance anonymity, achieving this improvement without introducing the bandwidth overhead associated with cover traffic.

 Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely used to identify anomalies in computer networks and raise alarms on intrusive behaviors. ML-based IDSs generally take network traces or host logs as input to extract patterns from individual samples, whereas the inter-dependencies of network are often not captured and learned, which may result in large amount of uncertain predictions, false positives, and false negatives. To tackle the challenges in intrusion detection, we propose a graph neural network based intrusion detection system (GNN-IDS), which is data-driven and machine learning-empowered. In GNN-IDS, the attack graph and real-time measurements, representing the static and dynamic attributes of computer networks, respectively, are incorporated and associated to represent the complex computer networks. Graph neural networks are employed as the inference engine for intrusion detection. By learning network connectivity, graph neural networks can quantify the importance of neighboring nodes and node features to make more reliable predictions. Furthermore, by incorporating an attack graph, GNN-IDS could not only detect anomalies, but also identify the malicious actions causing the anomalies. The experimental results on a use case network with two synthetic datasets (one generated from public IDS data) show that the proposed GNN-IDS achieves good performance. The results are analyzed from the aspects of uncertainty, explainability, and robustness.

 Cyber attackers leverage malware to infiltrate systems, steal sensitive data, and extort victims, posing a significant cybersecurity threat. Security experts address this challenge by employing machine learning and deep learning approaches to detect malware precisely, using static, dynamic, or hybrid methodologies. They visualize malware to identify patterns, behaviors, and common features across different malware families. Various methods and tools are used for malware visualization to represent different aspects of malware behavior, characteristics, and relationships. This article evaluates the effectiveness of visualization techniques in detecting and classifying malware. We methodically categorize studies based on their approach to information retrieval, visualization, feature extraction, classification, and evaluation, allowing for an in-depth review of cutting-edge methods. This analysis identifies key challenges in visualization-based techniques and sheds light on the field's progress and future possibilities. Our thorough analysis can provide valuable insights to researchers, helping them establish optimal practices for selecting suitable visualizations based on the specific characteristics of the analyzed malware.

 Full Paper    

 In the evolving landscape of safety-critical infrastructures, ensuring the integrity and security of systems has become paramount. Building upon a previously established security architecture tailored for the railway sector, this work introduces significant enhancements that extend its applicability beyond the confines of any singular industry. Key advancements include the integration of a security heartbeat to augment safety monitoring, the implementation of a sophisticated secure update mechanism leveraging Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Enhanced Authorization (EA) policies, automated vulnerability scanning leveraging Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) logs to check against a vulnerability database, and a formal evaluation of system integrity reporting capabilities through remote attestation. Moreover, aiming for a universally adaptable framework, this paper proposes a reference architecture to accommodate various operational contexts. We use compartments as a universal abstraction for system components, designed to be compatible with a variety of real-time operating systems (RTOSes), including PikeOS, the ACRN hypervisor, and beyond.

 Full Paper    

 With the steady rising Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption world-wide, a consideration of the EV charging-related load on power grids is becoming critically important. While strategies to manage this load (e.g., to avoid peaks) exist, they assume that EVs and charging infrastructure are trustworthy. If this assumption is, however, violated (e.g., by an adversary with control over EV charging systems), the threat of charging load-based attacks on grid stability arises. An adversary may, for example, try to cause overload situations, by means of a simultaneous increase in charging load coordinated over a large number of EVs. In this paper, we propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines regression-based charging load prediction with novelty detection-based anomaly identification. The proposed system considers features from both the EV charging and power grid domains, which is enabled in this paper by a novel co-simulation concept. We evaluate our IDS concept with simulated attacks in real EV charging data. The results show that the combination of gradient boosting regression trees with elliptic envelope-based novelty detection generally provides the best results. Additionally, the evaluation shows that our IDS concept, combining grid and charging features, is capable of detecting novel/stealthy attack strategies not covered by related work.

 Short Paper    

 In an era where digital connectivity is increasingly foundational to daily life, the security of Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) is a critical concern. This paper addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in Wi-Fi APs, with a particular focus on those using proprietary file systems like MiniFS found in TP-Link’s AC1900 WiFi router. Through reverse engineering, we unravel the structure and operation of MiniFS, marking a significant advancement in our understanding of this previously opaque file system. Our investigation reveals not only the architecture of MiniFS but also identifies several private keys and underscores a concerning lack of cryptographic protection. These findings point to broader security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the risks of security-by-obscurity practices in an interconnected environment. Our contributions are twofold: firstly, based, on the file system structure, we develop a methodology for the extraction and analysis of MiniFS, facilitating the identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities. Secondly, our work lays the groundwork for further research into WiFi APs’ security, particularly those running on similar proprietary systems. By highlighting the critical need for transparency and community engagement in firmware analysis, this study contributes to the development of more secure network devices, thus enhancing the overall security posture of digital infrastructures.  

 SoK: How Artificial-Intelligence Incidents Can Jeopardize Safety and Security

 Sok Paper    

 In the past years, a growing number of highly-automated systems has build on artificial-intelligence (AI) capabilities, for example, automatic-driving vehicles or predictive health-state diagnosis. As for any software system, there is a risk that misbehavior occurs (e.g., system failure due to bugs) or that malicious actors aim to misuse the system (e.g., generating attack scripts), which can lead to safety and security incidents. While software safety and security incidents have been studied in the past, we are not aware of research focusing on the specifics of AI incidents. With this paper, we aim to shed light on this gap through a case survey of 240 incidents that we elicited from four datasets comprising safety and security incidents involving AI from 2014 to 2023. Using manual data analyses and automated topic modeling, we derived relevant topics as well as the major issues and contexts in which the incidents occurred. We find that the topic of AI incidents is, not surprisingly, becoming more and more relevant, particularly in the contexts of automatic driving and process-automation robotics. Regarding security and its intersection with safety, most incidents connect to generative AI (i.e., large-language models, deep fakes) and computer-vision systems (i.e., facial recognition). This emphasizes the importance of security to also ensure safety in the context of AI systems, with our results further revealing a high number of serious consequences (system compromise, human injuries) and major violations of confidentiality, integrity, availability, as well as authorization. We hope to support practitioners and researchers in understanding major safety and security issues to support the development of more secure, safe, and trustworthy AI systems.

 The Bitcoin network is susceptible to various attacks due to its openness, decentralization and plaintext connections. Bitcoin created a misbehavior-score mechanism for monitoring and tracking peer misconduct. In this paper, we uncover several vulnerabilities of this mechanism, leading to potential Bitcoin-Message-based DoS (BitMsg-DoS) attacks on Bitcoin nodes and Slander attacks by maligning innocent nodes. We prototype those attacks for our experiments against testing real nodes connected to the Bitcoin main network (while we do not exfiltrate our attacks to the real-world main network). The experimental results show that the attacks exert varying degrees of impact on mining and non-mining nodes, notably reducing mining rates by up to half for affected mining nodes and decreasing the synchronization speed of blocks for non-mining nodes. To address these drawbacks, this study proposes three corresponding countermeasures targeting the identified vulnerabilities in the misbehavior-score mechanism. Furthermore, we explore the P2P encrypted transport protocol with experimental support in the latest Bitcoin Core 26.0, but find it insufficient in mitigating the Slander attacks.  

 A Metalanguage for Dynamic Attack Graphs and Lazy Generation

 Full Paper    

 Two types of dynamics are important when modeling cyberattacks: how adversaries chain together techniques across systems and how they change the target systems. Attack graphs are prominent within research communities for automatically mapping and chaining together actions. Modeling adversary-driven system changes is comparatively unexplored, however. One reason could be that modeling adversarial change dynamics poses a blend of problems where the typical attack graph approaches could produce state-space explosions and infinite graphs. Therefore, this work presents the core modeling aspects of the Dynamic Meta Attack Language (DynaMAL), a project to lazily generate attack graphs by combining attack graph construction and simulation methods. DynaMAL lets users declare domain-specific modeling and attack graph generation languages. Then, the attack graphs are generated one step at a time based on the actions of an adversary agent. By only generating what is explicitly requested, DynaMAL can demonstrably change the system model as the attack graph grows while sidestepping typical state-space explosions and graph re-calculation problems. Shifting to a lazy generation process poses new challenges, however. Nevertheless, there is likely a point where lazy approaches will prevail when analyzing large and complex systems.

 Modern blockchains support the execution of application-level code in the form of smart contracts, allowing developers to devise complex Distributed Applications (DApps). Smart contracts are typically written in high-level languages, such as Solidity, and after deployment on the blockchain, their code is executed in a distributed way in response to transactions or calls from other smart contracts. As a common piece of software, smart contracts are susceptible to vulnerabilities, posing security threats to DApps and their users.  
   
  The community has already made many different proposals involving taxonomies related to smart contract vulnerabilities. In this paper, we try to systematize such proposals, evaluating their common traits and main discrepancies. A major limitation emerging from our analysis is the lack of a proper formalization of such taxonomies, making hard their adoption within, e.g., tools and disfavoring their improvement over time as a community-driven effort. We thus introduce a novel data model that clearly defines the key entities and relationships relevant to smart contract vulnerabilities. We then show how our data model and its preliminary instantiation can effectively support several valuable use cases, such as interactive exploration of the taxonomy, integration with security frameworks for effective tool orchestration, and statistical analysis for performing longitudinal studies.

 Full Paper    

 Many network protocol specifications are long and lack clarity, which paves the way to implementation errors. Such errors have led to vulnerabilities for secure protocols such as SSH and TLS. Active automata learning, a black-box method, is an efficient method to discover discrepancies between specification and its implementation. It consists in extracting state machines by interacting with a network stack. It can be (and has been) combined with model checking to analyze the obtained state machines. Model checking is designed for exhibiting a single model violation instead of all model violations and thus leads to a limited understanding of implementation errors. As far as we are aware, there is only one specialized exhaustive method available for analyzing the outcomes of active automata learning applied to network protocols,Fiterau-Brostean’s method. We propose an alternative method, to improve the discovery of new bugs and vulnerabilities and enhance the exhaustiveness of model verification processes. In this article, we apply our method to two use cases: SSH, where we focus on the analysis of existing state machines and OPC UA, for which we present a full workflow from state machine inference to state machine analysis.

 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) always had difficulties in detecting Zero-Day attacks (ZDAs). One of the advantages of Machine Learning (ML)-based IDSs, which is their superiority in detecting ZDAs, remains largely unexplored, especially when considering multiple ZDAs. This is mainly due to the fact that ML-based IDSs are mainly using supervised ML methods. Although they exhibit better performance in detecting known attacks, they are by design unable to detect unknown attacks because they are limited to detecting the labels present in the dataset they were trained on. This paper introduces SECL, a method that combines Contrastive Learning and a new regularization method composed of dropout, Von Neumann Entropy (VNE) and Sepmix (a regularization inspired from mixup). SECL is close to, or even better than supervised ML methods in detecting known attacks, while gaining the ability to detect and differentiate multiple ZDAs. Experiments were performed on three datasets, UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS2017 and WADI, effectively showing that this method is able to detect multiple ZDAs while achieving performance similar to supervised methods on known attacks. Notably, the proposed method even has an overall better performance than a supervised method knowing all attacks on the WADI dataset. These results pave the way for better detection of ZDAs, without reduction of performance on known attacks.

 Full Paper    

 In the current scenario, where cyber-incidents occur daily, an effective Incident Management Process (IMP) and its assessment have assumed paramount significance.  
   
  While assessment models, which evaluate the risks of incidents, exist to aid security experts during such a process, most of them provide only qualitative evaluations and are typically validated in individual case studies, predominantly utilizing non-public data.  
   
  This hinders their comparative quantitative analysis, incapacitating the evaluation of new proposed solutions and the applicability of the existing ones due to the lack of baselines.  
   
  To address this challenge, we contribute a benchmarking approach and system, BenchIMP, to support the quantitative evaluation of IMP assessment models based on performance and robustness in the same settings, thus enabling meaningful comparisons.  
   
  The resulting benchmark is the first one tailored for evaluating process-based security assessment models and we demonstrate its capabilities through two case studies using real IMP data and state-of-the-art assessment models.  
   
  We publicly release the benchmark to help the cybersecurity community ease quantitative and more accurate evaluations of IMP assessment models.  

 Towards Secure Virtual Elections: Multiparty Computation of Order Based Voting Rules

 Full Paper    

 Electronic voting systems have significant advantages in comparison with physical voting systems. One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are consistent with the cast ballots and that the voters' privacy is preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot secrecy in the sense that it issues only the required output while no other information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic elections.  

 Confidence-Aware Fault Trees

 Short Paper    

 Fault trees are one of the most well-known techniques for safety analysis, which allow both, quantitative and qualitative statements about systems. In the classical approach, deterministic failure probabilities for the basic events are necessary, in order to obtain quantified results. Classical hardware-related failures and events can be obtained through testing. Software-dependent failures are harder to measure and identify but are still possible to quantify when the implementation is given. In contrast, Machine Learning models lack this information, as their behaviour is not explicitly specified. Up to today, there are very few methods available to judge the worst-case performance of these models and predict their general performance.  
   
  To encounter this problem, we will introduce confidence levels inside the fault tree analysis. This will allow the usage of failure rate bounds at basic events, that only hold with given probability. We will present how this information can be used in the computations towards the top event. Our approach can be seen as a parallel or double application of a fault tree, to include the confidence levels. Consequently, also basic events, that depend on machine learning models, can be included in a fault tree analysis. The proposed technique is compared to probabilistic fault tree analysis in an example.

 Full Paper    

 Security assurance cases (SACs) consist of arguments that are supported by evidence to justify that a system is acceptably secure. However, they are a relatively static representation of the system’s security and therefore currently not effective at runtime which make them difficult to maintain and unable to support users during threats. The aim of this paper is to investigate how SACs can be adapted to become more effective at runtime and increase confidence in the system’s security. We extend an example SAC with game theory, which models the interaction between the system and attacker and identifies their optimal strategies based on their payoffs and likelihoods. The extension was added as a security control in the assurance case, where a security claim indicates what strategy should be taken at runtime. This claim changes dynamically with the recommended strategy output by the game-theoretic model at runtime. Based on the results of the evaluation, the extension was considered to be potentially effective, however this would further depend on how it is implemented in practice.

 The advent of 5G marks a remarkable advancement, offering faster data rates, lower latency, and improved connectivity. Yet, its complexity, stemming from factors such as integrating advanced technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and slicing, introduces challenges in implementing strong security measures against emerging threats. Although Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can be successfully employed to detect attacks, the novelty of 5G results in an expanded and new attack surface. Collaborative efforts are essential for detecting novel, and distributed attacks, and ensuring comprehensive observability in multiparty networks. However, such collaboration raises privacy concerns due to the sensitivity of shared data. Federated Learning (FL), a collaborative Machine Learning (ML) approach, is a promising solution to preserve privacy as the model is trained across devices without exchanging raw data.  
   
  In this paper, we examine ongoing efforts that propose FL-based IDS solutions in a 5G context. We set out to systematically review in light of challenges raised by their practical deployment in 5G networks. Out of the numerous papers we analyzed in FL, only 17 specifically concentrate on 5G scenario and they are the focus of this study. In this sok, we first identify IDS challenges in 5G. Second, we classify FL-based IDS according to (i) their 5G application domain, (ii) 5G challenges they address, and (iii) their FL approach in terms of architecture, parameters, detection method, evaluation, etc. Through this examination, we find out that some issues receive less attention or are overlooked, prompting us to explore potential solutions. Additionally, we have identified other challenges, like the lack of evaluation results applicability due to the difficulties to get high quality 5G datasets for FL-based IDS evaluation.

 Several websites integrate trackers without users’ consent. Previous research studied whether notifying responsible website operators about such issues is an effective measure, often with limited success. Insights from marketing research suggest that personalizing notification emails may be an effective means to improve remediation rates, with previous research pointing in both directions. We studied this approach using a sample of 119 German fitness and sports blogs employing Google Analytics (GA) without user consent: In a first step, we compare the fix rate of blog operators that received a personalized notification tailored to their blog with the fix rate of operators that received a generic notification. We find that personalized notifications do neither increase remediation rate nor operators’ response behavior. In a second step, we analyzed the reasons not to fix mentioned in (A) the email responses and (B) a survey sent to the blog operators. We find that they mostly center around (I) denial that a data leak exists, (II) a lack of resources to remedy the issue and (III) claims of specifically requiring GA. We hypothesize that an additional reason not to fix could be the so-called moral credentials phenomenon and sketch how to study that in future work.

 Spectral graph theory delves into graph properties through their spectral signatures. The eigenvalues of a graph's Laplacian matrix are crucial for grasping its connectivity and overall structural topology. This research capitalizes on the inherent link between graph topology and spectral characteristics to enhance spectral graph analysis applications. In particular, such connectivity information is key to detect low signals that betray the occurrence of cyberattacks. This paper introduces SpectraTW, a novel spectral graph analysis methodology tailored for monitoring anomalies in network traffic. SpectraTW relies on four spectral indicators, Connectedness, Flooding, Wiriness, and Asymmetry, derived from network attributes and topological variations, that are defined and evaluated. This method interprets networks as evolving graphs, leveraging the Laplacian matrix's spectral insights to detect shifts in network structure over time. The significance of spectral analysis becomes especially pronounced in the medical IoT domains, where the complex web of devices and the critical nature of healthcare data amplify the need for advanced security measures. Spectral analysis's ability to swiftly pinpoint irregularities and shift in network traffic aligns well with the medical IoT's requirements for prompt attack detection.

 GitHub workflows or GitHub CI is a popular continuous integration platform that enables developers to automate various software engineering tasks by specifying them as workflows, i.e., YAML files with a list of jobs. However, engineering valid workflows is tedious. They are also prone to severe security issues, which can result in supply chain vulnerabilities. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various software development tasks. However, GitHub workflows differ from regular programs in both structure and semantics. We perform the first comprehensive study to understand the effectiveness of LLMs on five workflow-related tasks with different levels of prompts. We curated a set of ∼400K workflows and generated prompts with varying detail. We also fine-tuned LLMs on GitHub workflow tasks. Our evaluation of three state-of-the-art LLMs and their fine-tuned variants revealed various interesting findings on the current effectiveness and drawbacks of LLMs.

 Remote Attestation is emerging as a promising technique to ensure that some remote device is in a trustworthy state. This can for example be an IoT device that is attested by a cloud service before allowing the device to connect. However, flaws in the communication protocols associated with the remote attestation mechanism can introduce vulnerabilities into the system design and potentially nullify the added security. Formal verification of protocol security can help to prevent such flaws. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of the necessary security properties for remote attestation focusing on the authenticity of the involved agents. We extend beyond existing work by considering the possibility of an attestation server (making the attestation process involve three parties) as well as requiring verifier authentication. We demonstrate that some security properties are not met by a state-of-the-art commercial protocol for remote attestation for our strong adversary model. Moreover, we design two new communication protocols for remote attestation that we formally prove fulfil all of the considered authentication properties.

 Reusable software components, typically integrated as libraries, are a central paradigm of modern software development.  
  By incorporating a library into their software, developers trust in its quality and its correct and complete implementation.  
  Since errors in a library affect all applications using it, there is a need for quality assurance tools such as automated testing that can be used by library and application developers to verify the functionality.  
  In the past decade, many different systems have been published that focus on the automated analysis of TLS implementations for finding bugs and security vulnerabilities.  
   
  However, all of these systems focus only on few TLS components and lack a common analysis scenario and inter-approach comparisons.  
  Especially, the amount of manual effort required across the whole analysis process to obtain the root cause of an error is often ignored.  
  In this paper, we survey and categorize literature on automated testing approaches for TLS libraries.  
  The results reveal a heterogeneous landscape of approaches with a trade-off between the manual effort required for setup and for result interpretation, along with major deficits in the considered performance metrics.  
  These imply important future directions which need to be followed to advance the current state of protocol test automation

 Recent vulnerabilities in software like Log4J raise the question whether the software supply chain is secured sufficiently.  
  Governmental initiatives in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) demand a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for solving this issue. A SBOM has to be produced by using creation tools and it has to be accurate and complete. In the past, there has been research in this field of research.  
   
  However, no detailed investigation of several tools producing SBOMs has been conducted regarding accuracy and reliability. For this reason, the following work presents a selection of four popular programming languages of web application and system-level software Python, C, Rust and Typescript. They build the base for four sample software projects and their package manager. For human checking the software projects are small with a small amount of packages and a single dependency. The open-source analysis tools are differed in programming language dependent and general usable tools and run in the standard execution mode on the software projects.  
   
  The results were checked against completeness and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) minimum and recommended elements. There is no recommendation for a specific tool as no tool fulfills every requirement, only two tools can be recommended in a limited way. Many tools do not provide a complete SBOM, as they do not depict every test package and dependency. Governmental initiatives should define further specifications on SBOM for example regarding their accuracy and depth. Further research in this field for example proprietary tools or other programming languages is desirable.

 Full Paper    

 Cybersecurity’s constantly evolving field demands defense mechanisms’ continuous development and refinement. Memory corruption attacks, including buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities, have long been a significant threat, especially for web browsers. Microsoft introduced Control Flow Guard (CFG) as a mitigative measure against advanced exploitation techniques, like ROP and use-after-free-based exploits, to address these risks. This paper delves into the internals of CFG, its implementation, effectiveness, and possible bypasses that could undermine its security. A thorough examination of Microsoft’s CFG design principles gives the reader an in-depth understanding of how CFG enforces control flow integrity within a program’s execution.

 If It Looks Like a Rootkit and Deceives Like a Rootkit: A Critical Examination of Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat Systems   
 Christoph Dorner  (St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria), Lukas Daniel Klausner  (St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria)   
 Full Paper    

 Addressing a critical aspect of cybersecurity in online gaming, this paper systematically evaluates the extent to which kernel-level anti-cheat systems mirror the properties of rootkits, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between protective and potentially invasive software. After establishing a definition for rootkits (making distinctions between rootkits and simple kernel-level applications) and defining metrics to evaluate such software, we introduce four widespread kernel-level anti-cheat solutions. We lay out the inner workings of these types of software, assess them according to our previously established definitions, and discuss ethical considerations and the possible privacy infringements introduced by such programs. Our analysis shows two of the four anti-cheat solutions exhibiting rootkit-like behaviour, threatening the privacy and the integrity of the system. This paper thus provides crucial insights for researchers and developers in the field of gaming security and software engineering, highlighting the need for informed development practices that carefully consider the intersection of effective anti-cheat mechanisms and user privacy.

 Full Paper    

 With the emergence of federated learning (FL) and its promise of privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, the field of intrusion  
  detection systems (IDSs) has seen a renewed interest in the development of collaborative models. However, the distributed nature of FL makes it vulnerable to malicious contributions from its participants, including data poisoning attacks. The specific case of label-flipping attacks, where the labels of a subset of the training data are flipped, has been overlooked in the context of IDSs that leverage FL primitives. This study aims to close this gap by providing a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the impact of label-flipping attacks on FL for IDSs. We show that such attacks can still have a significant impact on the performance of FL models, especially targeted ones, depending on parameters and dataset characteristics. Additionally, the provided tools and methodology can be used to extend our findings to other models and datasets, and benchmark the efficiency of existing countermeasures.

 Giuseppe Marco Bianco  (Politecnico di Torino, Italy), Luca Ardito  (Politecnico di Torino, Italy), Michele Valsesia  (Politecnico di Torino, Italy)   
 Full Paper    

 The IoT landscape is plagued by security and reliability concerns due to the absence of standardization, rendering devices susceptible to breaches. Certifying IoT firmware offers a solution by enabling consumers to easily identify secure products and incentivizing developers to prioritize secure coding practices, thereby fostering transparency within the IoT ecosystem. This study proposes a methodology centered on ELF binary analysis, aimed at discerning critical functionalities by identifying system calls within firmware. It introduces the manifest-producer tool, developed in Rust, for analyzing ELF binaries in IoT firmware certification. Employing static analysis techniques, the tool detects APIs and evaluates firmware behavior, culminating in the generation of JSON manifests encapsulating essential information. These manifests enable an assessment of firmware compliance with security and reliability standards, as well as alignment with declared device behaviors. Performance analysis using benchmarking tools demonstrates the tool's versatility and resilience across diverse programming languages and file sizes. Future avenues of research include refining API discovery algorithms and conducting vulnerability analyses to bolster IoT device security. This paper underscores the pivotal role of firmware certification in cultivating a safer IoT ecosystem and presents a valuable tool for realizing this objective within academic discourse.

 Full Paper    

 Machine learning (ML) models are used in many safety and security-critical applications nowadays. It is therefore of interest to measure the security of a system that uses ML as its component.  
   
  This paper deals with the field of ML, especially security on autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, the concept of a technical framework will be described, implemented, and evaluated in a case study. Based on ISO/IEC 27004:2016, risk indicators are utilized to measure and evaluate the extent of damage and the effort required by an attacker. It is not possible, as assumed, to determine a risk value that represents the attacker's effort. Therefore, four different values must be interpreted individually.

 Analyzing Air-traffic Security using GIS-``blur'' with Information Flow Control in the IIIf   
 Florian Kammueller  (Middlesex University London and TU Berlin, United Kingdom)   
 Full Paper    

 In this paper, we address security and privacy of air-traffic control systems. Classically these systems are closed proprietary systems. However, air-traffic monitoring systems like flight-radars are decentralized public applications risking loss of confidential information thereby creating security and privacy risks. We propose the use of the Isabelle Insider and Infrastructure framework (IIIf) to alleviate the security specification and verification of air traffic control systems. This paper summarizes the IIIf and then illustrates the use of the framework on the application of a flight path monitoring system. Using the idea of blurring visual data to obfuscate privacy critical data used in GIS systems, we observe that for dynamic systems like flightradars, implicit information flows exist. We propose information hiding as a solution. To show the security of this approach, we present the extension of the IIIf by a formal notion of indistinguishability and prove the central noninterference property for the flight path monitoring application with hiding.

 Full Paper    

 The evolving landscape of global security has shifted away from the traditional dynamics of superpower confrontations towards a more complex interaction involving both state and non-state actors. This transition is fueled by factors like globalization, resource competition, and shifts in political and social frameworks, contributing to heightened levels of uncertainty. Simultaneously, there has been an 'information revolution' driven by technologies such as the Internet and mobile phones, ushering in an era dominated by computer-based decision-making. This evolving Information Environment encompasses various components, from the information itself to the actors and systems facilitating its utilization. The capability to influence perceptions, especially among local populations, holds significant strategic importance in military contexts. Additionally, the growing dependence on Information Technology (IT) introduces both opportunities for exploitation and vulnerabilities that require attention, particularly in the dissemination of information and disinformation campaigns via the Internet. In this paper, the authors explore technical enablers that can help to mitigate the downside effects of information warfare targeted against individuals engaged in information warfare campaigns. A three-fold analysis unveils alternatives for monitoring the cognitive domain capabilities, the analysis of external sources of information (e.g., OSINT sources), and analysis of cognitive patterns. The ultimate goal is to suggest defensive mechanisms to diminish the likelihood of success of an adversarial attack through deterrence from others' perceptions effectively

 Full Paper    

 In recent years the technology field has grown exponentially, bringing with it new possibilities, but also new threats. This rapid advancement has created fertile grounds for new sophisticated cyber attacks, exhibiting a high degree of complexity. In an ever evolving cyber landscape, organizations need to dedicate valuable resources in enhancing their understanding of emergent threats for the purposes of identification, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this task, they rely on Cyber Situation Awareness (CSA), a framework designed for the purposes of managing the virtual environment through the perception and comprehension of the behaviors therein, be that benign or malicious, followed by modeling the future state of the environment based on the gathered information. In this paper, we will discuss how exactly the theory of Situation Awareness has been applied to the cyber domain. Further on, we will present various techniques used for handling the large quantity of complex data and managing the dynamic nature of the environment by Cyber Situation Operation Centers (CSOC) and discuss in detail a number of methodologies that have been designed for the evaluation of the level of CSA. Finally, we will provide specific examples of simulated scenarios for the application of the CSA assessment techniques.

 In today's dynamic and complex warfare landscape, characterized by the convergence of traditional and emerging threats, the significance of cybersecurity in shaping modern conflicts cannot be overstated. Such trend presents a challenging paradigm shift in how military organizations approach mosaic warfare in the digital age since new attack vectors and targets appear in their landscapes. In this vein, it is pivotal for military teams to have a clear and concise roadmap for cybersecurity incidents linked to potential mosaic warfare. This manuscript introduces a novel approach to bolstering mosaic warfare strategies by integrating an advanced Knowledge Representation and Reasoning system and a tailored ontology. Motivated by the critical role of cybersecurity in contemporary warfare, the proposed system aims to enhance situational awareness, decision-making capabilities, and operational effectiveness in the face of evolving cyber threats. In this sense, this manuscript entails a new ontology that not only covers the cybersecurity realm but also introduces key concepts related to strategic and operational military levels at the same time. The ad-hoc ontology is also compared against other well-known ones, such as MITRE, NATO, or UCO approaches and manifests a significant performance by employing standardized quality metrics for ontologies. Lastly, a realistic mosaic warfare scenario is contextualized to demonstrate the deployment of the proposed system and how it can properly represent all information gathered from heterogeneous data sources.

 Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) is an important element in both cyber security and cyber defence to inform processes and activities on strategic, tactical, and operational level. Furthermore, CSA enables informed decision making. The ongoing digitization and interconnection of previously unconnected components and sectors equally affects the civilian and military sector. In defence, this means that the cyber domain is both a separate military domain as well as a cross-domain and connecting element for the other military domains comprising land, air, sea, and space. Therefore, CSA must support perception, comprehension, and projection of events in the cyber space for persons with different roles and expertise. This paper introduces NEWSROOM, a research initiative to improve technologies, methods, and processes specifically related to CSA in cyber defence. For this purpose, NEWSROOM aims to improve methods for attacker behavior classification, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) collection and interaction, secure information access and sharing, as well as human computer interfaces (HCI) and visualizations to provide persons with different roles and expertise with accurate and easy to comprehend mission- and situation-specific CSA. Eventually, NEWSROOM's core objective is to enable informed and fast decision-making in stressful situations of military operations. The paper outlines the concept of NEWSROOM and explains how its components can be applied in relevant application scenarios.

 Nowadays, the usage of computers ranges from activities that do not consider sensitive data, such as playing video games, to others managing confidential information, like military operations. Additionally, regardless of the actions performed by subjects, most computers store different pieces of sensitive data, making the implementation of robust security mechanisms a critical and mandatory task. In this context, continuous authentication has been proposed as a complementary mechanism to improve the limitations of conventional authentication methods. However, mainly driven by the evolution of Machine Learning (ML), a series of challenges related to authentication performance and, therefore, the feasibility of existing systems are still open. This work proposes the usage of contextual information related to the applications executed in the computers to create ML models able to authenticate subjects continuously. To evaluate the suitability of the proposed context-aware ML models, a continuous authentication framework for computers has been designed and implemented. Then, a set of experiments with a public dataset with 12 subjects demonstrated the improvement of the proposed approach compared to the existing ones. Precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics are raised from an average of 0.96 (provided by general ML models proposed in the literature) to 0.99-1.

 Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), in addition to closed military sources, provides timely information on emerging cyber attack techniques, attacker groups, changes in IT products, policy updates, recent events, and much more. Often, dozens of analysts scour hundreds of sources to gather, categorize, cluster, and prioritize news items, delivering the most pertinent information to decision makers. However, the sheer volume of sources and news items is continually expanding, making manual searches increasingly challenging. Moreover, the format and presentation of this information vary widely, with each blog entry, threat report, discussion forum, and mailing list item appearing differently, further complicating parsing and extracting relevant data. The research projects NEWSROOM and EUCINF, under the European Defence Fund (EDF), focus on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance mission-oriented cyber situational awareness. These EDF initiatives are instrumental in advancing Taranis AI, a tool designed to categorize news items using machine learning algorithms and extract pertinent entities like company names, products, CVEs, and attacker groups. This enables the indexing and labeling of content, facilitating the identification of relationships and grouping of news items related to the same events -- a crucial step in crafting cohesive "stories." These stories enable human analysts to swiftly capture the most significant current "hot topics", alleviating them from the task of consolidating or filtering redundant information from various sources. Taranis AI further enhances its capabilities by automatically generating summaries of reports and stories, and implementing a collaborative ranking system, among other features. This paper serves as an introduction to Taranis AI, exploring its NLP advancements and their practical applications. Additionally, it discusses lessons learned from its implementation and outlines future directions for research and development.

 Full Paper    

 Cyber planners face a considerable challenge in finding holistic solutions for a cyber defence decision-support system - a core module of a cyber situation awareness capability. Due to a fast-evolving cyberspace, decision makers assisted by technical staff are prone to carry out qualitative assessments when planning and conducting cyber operations instead of exclusively relying on quantitative assessments to articulate cyber defence mechanisms. A hybrid setting combining both types of assessments would be key to have the ability to monitor progression, anticipate deviations from initial plans and evaluate effectiveness towards mission accomplishment. In line with this rationale, the authors propose a thorough analysis and tailorness of the operation assessment framework applied to the characteristics of the cyberspace in view of identifying a proper methodology able to regularly assess the situation and provide mitigation measures to fix goal alignment problems including measuring effects of cyber deception. Such goals are considered decisive conditions of the operation design. The results are expected to shed some light about measuring the required performance of action and effectiveness using mission impact and risk calculations among others.

 Full Paper    

 Reversible network covert channels are a security threat that allows its users to restore the carrier object before sending it to the overt receiver, drawing detection challenging. Some of these covert channels utilize computational intensive operations, such as the calculation of cryptographic hash chains. Currently, these computational intensive reversible covert channels are considered difficult to detect.  
  This paper proposes ways of utilizing shape analysis of packet runtime distributions to detect such computational intensive covert channels. To this end, we simulated the latency of traffic modified by a hash-chain based covert channel by adding mock hash-reconstruction runtimes to runtimes of legitimate ping traffic. After qualitatively observing the changes in the empirical probability distribution between modified and natural traffic, we investigated machine learning algorithms for their ability to detect the covert channel’s presence. We show that a decision tree-based AdaBoost classifier using the investigated statistical measures as input vector and a convolutional neural network applied directly to the packet runtime empirical probability distribution are able to classify sets of 50 ping measurements with high accuracy for low to medium high latency connections. Our approach improves significantly over previous work done on the detection of computational intensive covert  
  channels as our approach both requires smaller sampling window sizes and achieves significantly higher detection rates on the same reference dataset.

 One of the foundations of cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work consensus is mining. This is an activity which consumes a lot of computational resources, so malicious actors introduce cryptojacking malware to exploit users computers and in result use their victim resources. Cryptojacking emerged several years ago together with the increasing adoption and prevalence of cryptocurrencies. This type of malware may have several types, but in this paper we consider malicious scripts embedded into the websites. As the threat is real and we hear regularly about affected websites including major web content providers, in this paper we analyzed selected promising detection methods based on more sophisticated techniques which are not only based on blacklisting which is the most common way of preventing this kind of attacks. The analysis resulted in findings showing all the considered solutions can be tricked from the controlled server. Fortunately, we also show the ways how the considered solutions can be improved, so the proposed methods can be efficient again.

 The widespread of digital platforms, that prioritize content based on engagement metrics and reward content creators accordingly, has contributed to the expansion of disinformation with all its social and political impact. We propose a verification system to counterbalance disinformation in two stages. First, a system that allows media industries to watermark their image and video content.  
   
  Second, a user platform for news consumers to verify if images and video over the internet have been modified. However, digital platforms, often developed as black boxes that hide their rationale from users and prioritize the investor’s interests over ethical and social concerns, have contributed to this disinformation and to a general lack of trust in verification systems. In this paper, we address trustworthiness and explainability in the development of the user platform to increase its trustworthiness and acceptance based on three iterations of an international user study.

 In the rapidly evolving digital world, network security is a critical concern. Traditional security measures often fail to detect unknown attacks, making anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) using Machine Learning (ML) vital. However, these systems face challenges such as computational complexity and misclassification errors. This paper presents ZW-IDS, an innovative approach to enhance anomaly-based NIDS performance. We propose a two-layer classification NIDS integrating zero-watermarking with data provenance and ML. The first layer uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) with ensemble learning model for feature selection. The second layer generates unique zero-watermarks for each data packet using data provenance information. This approach aims to reduce false alarms, improve computational efficiency, and boost NIDS classification performance. We evaluate ZW-IDS using the CICIDS2017 dataset and compare its performance with other multi-method ML and Deep Learning (DL) solutions.

 Single-image steganalysis in real-world scenarios based on classifier inconsistency detection   
 Daniel Lerch-Hostalot  (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Spain), David Megías Jimenez  (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Spain)   
 Full Paper    

 This paper presents an improved method for estimating the accuracy of a model based on images intended for prediction, enhancing  
  the standard Detection of Classifier Inconsistencies (DCI) method. The conventional DCI method typically requires a large enough set of images from the same source to provide accurate estimations, which limits its practicality. Our enhanced approach overcomes this limitation by generating a set of images from a single original image, thereby enabling the application of the standard DCI method without requiring more than one target image. This method ensures that the generated images maintain the statistical properties of the original, preserving any embedded steganographic messages, through the use of non-destructive image manipulations such as flips, rotations, and shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces results comparable to those of the traditional DCI method, effectively estimating model accuracy with as few as 32 generated images. The robustness of our approach is also confirmed in challenging scenarios involving cover source mismatch (CSM), making it a viable solution for real-world applications.

 This work explores the potential of synthetic media generated by AI, often referred to as Deepfakes, as a source of cover-objects for steganography. Deepfakes offer a vast and diverse pool of media, potentially improving steganographic security by leveraging cover-source mismatch, a challenge in steganalysis where training and testing data come from different sources.  
   
  The present paper proposes an initial study on Deepfakes' effectiveness in the field of steganography. More precisely, we propose an initial study to assess the impact of Deepfakes on image steganalysis performance in an operational environment. Using a wide range of image generation models and state-of-the-art methods in steganography and steganalysis, we show that Deepfakes can significantly exploit the cover-source mismatch problem but that mitigation solutions also exist. The empirical findings can inform future research on steganographic techniques that exploit cover-source mismatch for enhanced security.

 In recent years, malware is increasingly using steganographic methods (so-called stegomalware) to remain hidden as long as possible. It not only covers its tracks on the infected system, but also tries to hide its communication with adversary infrastructure.  
   
  This paper reviews 105 stegomalware cases on the basis of 142 reports, ranging from digital media (audio, video, images) to text and network steganography. For this purpose, the covert channels used by the malware are categorized and introduced using a pattern-based approach. Our survey reveals that solely a small set of patterns are used and the most frequent methods rely on modulation of states and values. We also analyzed the commonalities of media, text and network stegomalware and found that least significant bit (LSB) steganography is exclusively utilized for media steganography. Our results indicate, that only a small variation of network protocols, media types and hiding methods are utilized by stegomalware and therefore, research may focus on these to counter malicious activities covered by steganography.

 Containers offer lightweight execution environments for implementing microservices or cloud-native applications. Owing to their ubiquitous diffusion jointly with the complex interplay of hardware, computing, and network resources, effectively enforcing container security is a difficult task. Specifically, runtime detection of threats poses many challenges since containers are often immutable (i.e., they cannot be instrumented or inspected), and many malware deploys obfuscation or elusive mechanisms. Therefore, in this work we propose a deep-learning-based approach for identifying the presence of two containers colluding to covertly leak secret information. In more detail, we consider a threat actor trying to exfiltrate a 4,096-bit private TLS key via five different covert channels. To decide whether containers are colluding for leaking data, the deep learning model is fed with statistical indicators of the syscalls, which are built starting from simple counters. Results indicate the effectiveness of our approach, even if some adjustments are needed to reduce the number of false positives.

 Robust and Homomorphic Covert Channels in Streams of Numeric Data   
 Jörg Keller  (FernUniversität in Hagen, Germany), Carina Heßeling  (FernuUniversitaet Hagen, Germany), Steffen Wendzel  (Worms University of Applied Sciences, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 A steganographic network storage channel that uses a carrier with a stream of numeric data must consider the possibility that the carrier data is processed before the covert receiver can extract the secret data. A sensor data stream, which we take as an example scenario, may be scaled by multiplication, shifted into a different range by addition, or two streams might be merged by adding their values. This raises the question if the storage channel can be made robust against such carrier modifications. On the other hand, if the pieces of secret data are numeric as well, adding and merging two streams each comprising covert data might be exploited to form a homomorphic covert channel. We investigate both problems together as they are related and give positive and negative results. In particular, we present the first homomorphic storage covert channel. Moreover, we show that such type of covert channel is not restricted to sensor data streams, but that very different scenarios are possible.

 An Identity Key Management System with Deterministic Key Hierarchy for SSI-native Internet of Things   
 Alice Colombatto  (LINKS Foundation, Italy), Luca Giorgino  (LINKS Foundation, Italy), Andrea Vesco  (LINKS Foundation, Italy)   
 Full Paper    

 The key to secure implementation of the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model in IoT nodes is the Key Management System (KMS). A KMS for a large number of identity key pairs, bound to an appropriate combination of the IoT node hardware and firmware, and possibly running in a Trusted Execution Environment to ensure a high level of trust in the isolation, access control, and validity of key material and cryptographic operations. This paper presents the design of a novel KMS for SSI native IoT nodes, which adapts the principles of the deterministic key hierarchy used by cryptocurrency wallets to provide trusted key pair generation and usage to any SSI framework.  
   
  The implementation of the identity path and identity key derivation algorithm on a constrained IoT node demonstrates the feasibility of the design.

 Service Provider Accreditation: Enabling and Enforcing Privacy-by-Design in Credential-based Authentication Systems

 Full Paper    

 In credential-based authentication systems (wallets), users transmit personally identifiable and potentially sensitive data to Service Providers (SPs). Here, users must often trust that they are communicating with a legitimate SP and that the SP has a lawful reason for requesting the information that it does. In the event of data misuse, identifying and holding the SP accountable can be difficult.  
   
  In this paper, we first enumerate the privacy requirements of electronic wallet systems. For this, we explore applicable legal frameworks and user expectations. Based on this, we argue that forcing each user to evaluate each SP individually is not a tractable solution. Instead, we outline technical measures in the form of an SP accreditation system. We delegate trust decisions to an authorized Accreditation Body (AB), which equips each SP with a machine-readable set of data permissions. These permissions are checked and enforced by the user's wallet software, preventing over-sharing sensitive data. The accreditation body we propose is publicly auditable. By enabling the detection of misconduct, our accreditation system increases user trust and thereby fosters the proliferation of the system.

 Long-Lived Verifiable Credentials: Ensuring Durability Beyond the Issuer’s Lifetime   
 Ricardo Bochnia  (HTW Dresden, Germany), Jürgen Anke  (HTW Dresden, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to digitize physical credentials is gaining momentum. In particular, credentials such as diplomas may need to remain valid for decades, sometimes outliving their issuers. For instance, a university diploma remains valid even if the issuing university merges or dissolves. We are therefore exploring the challenges that Long-Lived Verifiable Credentials (LLVCs) face in maintaining their value and verifiability over the long term. Although verifiers do not directly contact issuers when verifying a VC, they may still rely on an existing issuer, e.g., to verify the credential's revocation state maintained by the issuer. If the issuer dissolves, the SSI trust triangle is broken, and the VC may lose its value, requiring approaches to preserve the longevity of LLVCs. To address these and other challenges of long-lived credentials, we analyze the management and requirements of physical education credentials as a prime example of long-lived physical credentials (LLPCs), leveraging them as a model for designing LLVCs. Our findings suggest a combination of approaches to effectively design LLVCs to address the unique challenges of long-lived credentials. Beyond technical approaches, such as the potential use of ledgers, our research also highlights the need for sustainable governance structures that extend beyond the life of the issuer to ensure that LLVCs achieve durability comparable to their physical counterparts.

 Verifiable Credentials (VCs) allow users to assert claims about themselves in a cryptographically-verifiable way. In last the few years, several different VC schemes have emerged, offering varying levels of privacy through different cryptographic techniques. Current VC implementations aim for security against attacks that use classical computers, but the cryptography in use is vulnerable to attacks if the full power of quantum computing is ever realised. Addressing this threat is important as VCs are gaining traction for applications with safety and security implications (e.g. the mobile Driver's License (mDL)). This work examines the cryptographic underpinnings of VCs to discuss quantum-safety, and makes recommendations regarding the next steps in the transition to post-quantum cryptography.

 Towards Functions for Verifiable Credentials in a 2-Holder Model   
 Markus Batz  (Stadt Köln, Germany), Sebastian Zickau  (Stadt Köln, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 The trust model commonly used to describe digital identity ecosystems covers the roles issuer, holder and verifier which in general interact through the activities issue/hold, present/verify and revoke. The use case "German health certificate" discussed here reveals that processes may incorporate more than just one holder and require credential exchange between them. After issuance to one holder other holders occur which also may or even must present the credential in the further course. Therefore, a holder must be able to execute functions on credentials in its wallet such that some other holder also holds this credential and is able to present it successfully. To formally describe such functions and the necessary data structures in credentials, the "1-holder"-trust triangle is extended to a "2-holder"-model with two holders. Based on this extended model possible and relevant functions and their semantics in terms of verification results are defined. A concept to extend SD-JWT data structures to support this semantics is presented and its applicability is shown.

 Full Paper    

 Identity management enables users to access services around the globe. The user information is managed in some sort of identity management system. With the proposed shift to self-sovereign identities, self-sovereign control is shifted to the individual user. However, this also includes responsibilities, for example, in case of incidents. This is the case although they typically do not have the capability to do so. In order to provide users with more control and less responsibilities, we unite identity management systems with public key infrastructures. This consolidation allows more flexible and customized trust relationships to be created and validated. This paper explains, analyzes, and validates our novel design for a Distributed Identity Information Network (DistIN) that allows a high degree of decentralization while aiming for high security, privacy, usability, scalability, and sovereignty. The primary advantage of the system lies in its flexibility and ease of use, which also enables smaller organizations or even private individuals to participate in the network with a service. This work compiles categorized requirements from the literature and analyzes the verification and authentication data flows. On this basis, the security analysis and validation are following. This work is an essential step to reach the goal of the final web-based DistIN protocol and application.

 In IoT applications, embedded devices acquire and transmit data to control and optimize industrial processes. In order to trust this data, the trustworthiness of the data acquisition system, such as the sensors and the integrated signal processing components, is a crucial requirement. Software authenticity is provided with concepts like measured boot. Expanding authenticity to hardware components requires and motivates new approaches like hardware fingerprinting.  
   
  In this paper, we review and systematize current research and trends in hardware fingerprinting. We provide insights to current research directions by reviewing multiple survey and review papers and derive a common definition for fingerprinting based on the reviewed literature.  
   
  We identify three different fingerprinting techniques: Hardware Fingerprinting, Behavior Fingerprinting and Radio Frequency Fingerprinting, which can be used for multiple application scenarios. By decomposing a common embedded system architecture, we provide four trust domains from which we can create a hardware fingerprint: Main Processing Domain, On-Device Communication Domain, Peripheral Domain and Environmental Domain.  
   
  With this in mind, a new fingerprinting taxonomy is developed, taking into account different data sources and evaluation techniques. We distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic data sources and direct and indirect data evaluation.  
   
  In order to get an understanding of the scope of the fingerprinting techniques w.r.t. their trust domain and application scenarios, a new categorization model is created which binds the data sources to a physical asset of the device, thus making it possible to determine to what extend a device's components can be trusted and in which applications it may be applicable.

 Recently, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems, also called car audio video navigation (AVN) systems hold a wealth of digital data valuable for forensic investigations, encompassing navigation history, call logs, and Bluetooth connections. They serve as central hubs for entertainment, communication, and navigation, storing crucial evidence for accidents, thefts, and cybercrimes. Therefore, forensic investigations of IVI systems are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we conduct a forensic analysis of an Android Jellybean-based AVN system installed in Kia K5 2017. We first efficiently collect system logs as well as navigation logs using the log menu of an engineering mode provided by the car manufacturer company. Therefore, our data collection method does not require a chip-off technique or rooting of the AVN system. Next, we analyze the collected logs systematically and the differences between the two types of log data. Our forensic investigation method can provide insights into occupant activities and reconstruct events leading to incidents and car crimes.

 SILVANUS is a scientific collaboration EU-funded project with the goal to mitigate the growing impact of wildfires caused by global climate change by implementing a comprehensive global fire prevention strategy. Due to the significant complexity and collaborative nature of the project which involves more than 50 parties, it is a challenge to ensure unified and governed security especially that the platform is based on heterogeneous and multi-component architecture. To ensure that the expectations are delivered, different architecture perspectives need to be considered and one of these is identity and access management.

We start with the high level overview supported by requirements expresses as policies, introduce the identity governance and administration as well as access management areas, and then analyze the next level of the IAM architectuer based on XACML concept. We also cover IAM processes and monitoring which are inherent constituents of the complete solution. Finally, in certain aspects we consider different maturity levels and position appropriately the current development stage.

 Clogging Denial of Service (DoS) attacks have disrupted or disabled various networks, in spite of security mechanisms. External adversaries can severely harm networks, especially when high-overhead security mechanisms are deployed in resource-constrained systems. This can be especially true in the emerging standardized secure Vehicular Communication (VC) systems: mandatory message signature verification can be exploited to exhaust resources and prevent validating information that is, critical, often, for transportation safety. Although efficient message verification schemes and better provisioned devices could serve as potential remedies, we point out the limitations of existing solutions, challenges to address for scalable and resilient secure VC systems, and, most notably, the need for integrating defense mechanisms against clogging DoS attacks. We position that the existing secure VC protocols are vulnerable to clogging DoS attacks and recommend symmetric key chain based pre-validation with mandatory signature verification to thwart clogging DoS attacks, while maintaining all key security properties, including non-repudiation to enable accountability.

 Ensuring both reliable and low-latency communications over 4G or 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) is a key feature for services such as smart power grids and the metaverse. However, the lack of appropriate security mechanisms at the lower-layer protocols of the RAN--a heritage from 4G networks--opens up vulnerabilities that can be exploited to conduct stealthy Reduction-of-Quality attacks against the latency guarantees. This paper presents an empirical assessment of a proposed time-delay attack that leverages overshadowing to exploit the reliability mechanisms of the Radio Link Control (RLC) in Acknowledged Mode. By injecting falsified RLC Negative Acknowledgements, an attacker can maliciously trigger retransmissions at the victim User Equipment (UE), degrading the uplink latency of application flows. Extensive experimental evaluations on open-source and commercial off-the-shelf UEs demonstrate the attack's effectiveness in increasing latency, network load, and buffer occupancy. The attack impact is quantified by varying the bitrate representing different applications and the number of injected negative acknowledgments controlling the attack intensity. This work studies a realistic threat against the latency quality of service in 4G/5G RANs and highlights the urgent need to revisit protocol security at the lower-RAN layers for 5G (and beyond) networks.

 This paper presents a study of the effect of the size of the time window from which network features are derived on the predictive ability of a Random Forest classifier implemented as a network intrusion detection component. The network data is processed using granular computing principles, gradually increasing the time windows to allow the detection algorithm to find patterns in the data at different levels of granularity. Experiments were conducted iteratively with time windows ranging in size from 2 to 1024 seconds. Each iteration involved time-based clustering of the data, followed by splitting into training and test sets at a ratio of 67% - 33%. The  
   
  Random Forest algorithm was applied as part of a 10-fold cross-validation. Assessments included standard detection metrics: accuracy, precision, F1 score, BCC, MCC and recall. The results show a statistically significant improvement in the detection of cyber attacks in network traffic with a larger time window size (p-value 0.001953125). These results highlight the effectiveness of using longer time intervals in network data analysis, resulting in increased anomaly detection.

 In recent years, the increasing sophistication and proliferation of cyberthreats have underscored the necessity for robust network security measures, as well as a comprehensive approach to cyberprotection at large. As cyberthreats are continuously more and more complex, and their detection, response and mitigation often involve dealing with big data, the need for novel solutions is present also in cyber-criminal law enforcement (LEA) and network forensics contexts. Traditional, anomaly-based or signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) often face challenges in adapting to the evolving cyberattack landscape. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach, proving its ability to detect complex patterns in big data, including applications such as intrusion detection and classification of threats in the network environment, with high accuracy and precision (reduced rate of false positives). In this paper we present the Trustworthy Cyberattack Detector tool (TCAD), benefiting from the machine learning algorithms for the detection and classification of cyberattacks. TCAD can be used for monitoring the network in real-time and for offline analysis of collected network data. We believe that the TCAD can be successfully applied for the task of detecting and classifying evidence during criminal investigations related to network cyber attacks, but also can be helpful for the correlation of discovered network-based events over time with other collected non-network evidence.

 Anomaly detection mechanisms for in-vehicle and V2X systems

 Full Paper    

 Modern V2X systems have an increasing number of interfaces that allow remote connectivity, but also include the risk of exposure to cyber threats. The attack surface for such threats is hence constantly increasing and in combination with privacy issues that may arise through the presence of sensitive data from users in the V2X ecosystem, this necessitates the requirement for security mechanisms. However, the existing mechanisms to ensure protection against such threats face major hurdles, such as 1) the lack of in-vehicle addressing schemes, 2) the abundance of V2X interfaces and 3) the manufacturer-specific architecture of each vehicle consisting of a variety of different systems. On top of these hurdles, a solution should satisfy the real-time requirements of the resource-constrained in-vehicle architecture by remaining lightweight and highly reliable as well as by avoiding false positive indications and alarms. This article presents a novel anomaly detection solution for addressing the main challenges of security mechanisms by simultaneously keeping a minimal impact on the real-time in-vehicle requirements. The solution is demonstrated through an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging hub testbed that implements anomaly detection schemes to detect proof-of-concept cyber-attacks targeting EV charging profile and causing cascading effects by zeroing the vehicle speed.

This paper expands the methodological scope of STPA, by including an iterative Root-Cause Analysis element, which examines the possible emergence of UCAs due to either malfunction, or malicious action. Output of the method are the attributes and constraints of Resilience Modes of system configuration and operation, named ''Cyber Safe Position`` (CSP).

 With the ongoing shift to electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries are becoming essential components for vehicles. Battery management systems manages these batteries. While battery management systems typically used to be placed deep in the vehicle architecture, away from the external facing surface of vehicles, they are now more and more connected to backend systems, e.g., to improve monitoring battery properties and optimize charging. Hence, battery management systems have moved closer to the attack surface, increasing the risk of security incidents in these systems. Also, batteries will soon be reused in so-called second life applications, e.g., as an energy storage system in a private home. While conventional methods involve removing the battery and reusing it with a new battery management system, modern methods use the original battery management system. Security controls already exist in first and second life applications. However, there is a lack of research activities regarding the transition phase. This paper analyzes the phase of transferring the battery management system from the first to the second life of particular relevance for security, privacy, and intellectual property. We try to close this research gap by analyzing the security aspects of a battery management system life cycle and its altering system environment. We are defining the transition phase, identifying necessary activities, and providing cybersecurity needs for the transitioning of battery management system from first to second life.

 This paper explores the growing significance of vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs within the cybersecurity landscape, driven by regulatory changes in the European Union. The effectiveness of these programs relies heavily on the expertise of participants, presenting a challenge amid a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals, particularly in less sought-after sectors. To address this issue, the paper proposes a collaborative approach between academia and bug bounty issuers.  
   
  By integrating bug bounty programs into cybersecurity courses, students gain practical skills and soft skills essential for bug hunting and cybersecurity work. The collaboration benefits both issuers, who gain manageable manpower, and students, who receive valuable hands-on experience. A pilot conducted during the current academic year yielded positive results, indicating the potential of this approach to address the demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals. The insights gained from the pilot inform future considerations and advancements in this collaborative model.

 The popularity of chatbots to facilitate day-to-day business, including students and their study exercises, is on the rise. This paper investigates the extent and effects on the academic performance of students that leverage such tools. While many other approaches are hypothesized and discussed, we measure empirically. We recorded and compared the performance of cybersecurity students in weekly exercises and final exams over a period of three years.  
  This allows us to have three groups with varying degrees of ChatGPT influence, namely no access, uncontrolled access, and controlled access. In an anonymous survey, we found that approximately 80% of our students utilize ChatGPT during the weekly assignments in 2023. However, none of them indicated this on their submission, despite it being a mandatory requirement. Through statistical analysis of achieved points in our sample groups, we identified that students perform similarly on the weekly assignments. However, their performance on the final examination deteriorates.

 The need to educate users on cybersecurity to some extent is critical due to the ever-increasing cyber threats. A number of web presentations, books, and other study materials can be used for this purpose. In contrast to passive learning methods, hands-on training offers a deeper perspective but poses considerable technical challenges to its implementation, which can be resolved using cyber range platforms. However, in order to thoroughly evaluate the training and provide sufficient feedback, data must be collected and analyzed. Our paper addresses this problem by developing an event-based approach for data collection and analysis. The use of events allows us to keep a history of an event and reconstruct it retrospectively, especially for further analysis and evaluation. We validated the implemented approach in a cyber range environment, in which we developed an interactive interface to visualize the analyzed data.

 The fairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained tremendous attention within the criminal justice system in recent years, mainly when predicting the risk of recidivism. The primary reason is attributed to evidence of bias towards demographic groups when deploying these AI systems. Many proposed fairness-improving techniques applied at each of the three phases of the fairness pipelines, pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing phases, are often ineffective in mitigating the bias and attaining high predictive accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach by integrating existing fairness-improving techniques: Reweighing, Adversarial Learning, Disparate Impact Remover, Exponential Gradient Reduction, Reject Option-based Classification, and Equalized Odds optimization across the three fairness pipelines simultaneously. We evaluate the effect of combining these fairness-improving techniques on enhancing fairness and attaining accuracy. In addition, this study uses multi- and bi-objective optimization techniques to provide and to make well-informed decisions when predicting the risk of recidivism. Our analysis found that one of the most effective combinations (i.e., disparate impact remover, adversarial learning, and equalized odds optimization) demonstrates a substantial enhancement and balances achievement in fairness through various metrics without a notable compromise in accuracy.

 Nowadays, the Information Technology landscape is permeated by a multitude of vulnerabilities and threats. The constantly rising number of heterogeneous devices makes difficult or even impossible a complete mapping of all possible threats to which they are exposed. Antivirus and Anti-malware tools have been developed to quickly detect anomalous software or behaviors. However, these solutions often rely on a knowledge base stored in such a kind of database. They are not effective against unknown attacks, also known as zero-day attacks. By relying on real-time (network/system) log analysis it is possible to detect attacker activities.  
   
  The log analysis plays a crucial role against cyber threats providing an effective tool in order to detect them rapidly and build advanced monitoring systems. However, log consultation can often be a challenging and costly task. Over time, useful tools and utilities have been developed to simplify the task for analysts.  
   
  This paper presents a system capable to detect attackers' activities in a Cyber Range platform enabling the visualization of the attackers' activity traces exploiting the attack graph.

 A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is an inventory of the software components used to build a product, which can help customers track security risks throughout the development lifecycle. The popularity of SBOMs grew in May 2021 when the White House issued an executive order to improve the security of the software supply chain and the transparency of the government’s software inventory.  
   
  Although the growing interest in SBOM, many open challenges need to be addressed to help reduce exposure to cyber risks and enhance the security of software supply chains. To help the industry and research assemble the roadmap to achieve SBOM adoption in practice, in this paper, we analyze the challenges related to enabling technologies and the open issues that research must investigate. Furthermore, we perform a comparative analysis of the existing tools to generate SBOMs, demonstrating that the enabling technologies have not yet reached full automation and maturity.

 Current trends in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) capitalize on the extraction of features from the network traffic and the use of up-to-date machine and deep learning techniques to infer a detection model; in consequence, NIDS can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Differently from the plethora of contributions that apply (and misuse) feature-level attacks envisioned in application domains far from NIDS, this paper proposes a novel approach to adversarial attacks, which consists in a realistic problem-space perturbation of the network traffic. The perturbation is achieved through a traffic control utility. Experiments are based on normal and Denial of Service workloads in both legitimate and adversarial conditions, and the application of four popular techniques to learn the NIDS models. The results highlight the transferability of the adversarial examples generated by the proposed problem-space attack as well as the effectiveness at inducing traffic misclassifications across the NIDS models assessed.

 The Right to Be Zero-Knowledge Forgotten   
 Ivan Visconti  (DIEM, University of Salerno, Italy)   
 Full Paper    

 The main goal of the EU GDPR is to protect personal data of individuals within the EU. This is expressed in several rights and, among them, in this work we focus on the Right to Erasure, more commonly known as the Right to Be Forgotten (RtBF).  
   
  There is an intriguing debate about the affordable costs and the actual technical feasibility of satisfying the RtBF in digital platforms. We note that some digital platforms process personal data in order to derive and store correlated data raising two main issues: 1) removing personal data could create inconsistencies in the remaining correlated data; 2) correlated data could also be personal data. As such, in some cases, erasing personal data can trigger an avalanche on the remaining information stored in the platform.  
   
  Addressing the above issues can be very challenging in particular when a digital platform has been originally built without embedding in its design specific methodologies to deal with the RtBF.  
   
  This work aims at illustrating concrete scenarios where the RtBF is technically hard to guarantee with traditional techniques. On the positive side, we show how zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs can be leveraged to design affordable solutions in various use cases, especially when considered at design time. ZK proofs can be instrumental  
   
  for compliance to the RtBF revolutionizing the current approaches to design compliant systems. Concretely, we show an assessment scheme allowing to check compliance with th RtBF leveraging the power of ZK proofs. We analyze the above assessment scheme considering specific hard-to-address use cases.

 On Implementing Linear Regression on Homomorphically Encrypted Data: A Case-Study   
 Gianluca Dini  (University of Pisa, Italy)   
 Full Paper    

 Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a key technological enabler for secure computations as it allows a third-party to perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data learning neither the input nor the results of a computation. Notwithstanding the recent theoretical breakthroughs in FHE, building a secure and efficient FHE-based application is still a challenging engineering task where optimal choices are heavily application-dependent.  
   
  Taking linear regression as a case-study, we investigate the programming and configuration solutions to implement FHE-based applications. We show that, although obviously slower than the non-homomorphic version, the implementation of linear regression on homomorphically encrypted data is viable provided the programmer adopts appropriate programming expedients and parameters selection.

 Full Paper    

 The Internet of Things (IoT) presents transformative opportunities for connectivity and automation across various sectors, but it also introduces significant security risks that need to be comprehensively addressed. Indeed, the growing integration of IoT devices, including their vulnerabilities, into critical infrastructures amplifies potential risks in daily life, making these systems prime targets for cyber-criminal activities, including espionage and sabotage. Cases where IoT devices have been misused, due to firmware vulnerabilities, embedded passwords, and hidden backdoors are real-world scenarios, that pose significant threats to privacy and security. That's why this paper aims to point out the urgency of addressing these issues as IoT applications continue to proliferate across healthcare, transportation, urban development and other sectors.  
   
  Different types of vulnerabilities and their implications with focus on urban critical infrastructures, which can lead to severe consequences like energy blackouts, water contamination, and widespread service disruptions, especially in densely populated areas, are discussed.  
   
  Moreover, the need of a multidimensional approach that encompasses technological, legal, social, and economic considerations, to deal with those broader cybersecurity and risk management implications of IoT is highlighted. As a consequence, the need for continuous evolution in security strategies to keep pace with the rapid advancements in IoT technologies is pointed out, thus arguing for a proactive approach to safeguard IoT systems against emerging threats and to ensure the safe and resilient operation of these increasingly integral parts of modern critical infrastructures.

 A Systematic Review of Contemporary Applications of Privacy-Aware Graph Neural Networks in Smart Cities   
 Jingyan Zhang  (Dublin City University, Ireland), Irina Tal  (Dublin City University, Ireland)   
 Full Paper    

 In smart cities, graph embedding technologies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and related variants are extensively employed to address predictive tasks within complex urban networks, such as traffic management, the Internet of Things (IoT), and public safety. These implementations frequently require processing substantial personal information and topological details in graph formats, thereby raising significant privacy concerns. Mitigating these concerns necessitates an in-depth analysis of existing privacy preservation techniques integrated with GNNs in the specific context of smart cities. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive systematic review of current applications of privacy-aware GNNs in smart cities.  
   
  Our research commenced with a methodical literature search that identified 14 pertinent papers and summarized prevalent privacy preservation mechanisms, including federated learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, adversarial learning, and user-trust-based approaches. Subsequent analysis examined how the integration of these technologies with GNNs enhances privacy security and model utility in smart city applications. Further, we proposed an analytical framework for privacy-aware GNNs across the machine learning lifecycle, assessing the challenges of current integration from a practical viewpoint. The paper concluded by suggesting potential directions for future research.

 Within the dynamic realm of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) marks a significant paradigm shift. The IoV represents an interconnected network linking vehicles, infrastructures, and the Internet itself, driven by wireless communication technologies. This paper dissects the privacy landscapes of ITS and IoV, exploring gaps in standards and academic literature. Leveraging European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) ITS G5 standards and IoV analyses in literature, we build two relational models to depict their current privacy landscape. A contrastive analysis reveals structural disparities and thematic differences. ITS, governed by established standards, exhibits a robust structure, while IoV, in its nascent stage, lacks formalisation. Privacy concerns differ, with IoV emphasising user consent and multi-party privacy. Detailed analysis highlights data collection, sharing, and privacy policy challenges. As ITS transitions to IoV, data volume expands, necessitating enhanced privacy safeguards. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts to develop comprehensive privacy policies, prioritise user awareness, and integrate privacy by design principles. This paper offers insights into navigating the evolving landscape of transportation technologies, laying the groundwork for privacy-preserving ITS and IoV ecosystems.

 Incident management in telecom and computer networks requires correlating and interpreting heterogeneous technical information sources. While knowledge graphs have proven flexible for data integration and logical reasoning, their use in network and cybersecurity monitoring systems (NMS/SIEM) is not yet widespread. In this work, we explore the integration of knowledge graphs to facilitate the diagnosis of complex situations from the perspective of NetOps/SecOps experts who use NMS/SIEMs. Through expert interviews, we identify expectations in terms of ergonomics and decision support functions, and propose a Web-based client-server software architecture using an RDF knowledge graph that describes network systems and their dynamics. Based on a UI/UX evaluation and feedback from a user panel, we demonstrate the need to go beyond simple data retrieval from the knowledge graph. We also highlight the importance of synergistic reasoning and interactive analysis of multi-layered systems. Overall, our work provides a foundation for future designs of knowledge-graph-based NMS/SIEM decision support systems with hybrid logical/probabilistic reasoning.

 Cyber-Physical Systems ( CPS s) complexity, automation, and interconnection have been continuously increasing to support new opportunities and functionalities in numerous life-impacting applications, such as e-health, Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices, or Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). These characteristics introduce new critical security challenges to both industrial practitioners and academics. This work investigates how Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and attack graph approaches could be leveraged to model and analyze secure CPS solutions for identifying high-impact attacks at the architecture phase of the secure system development life cycle. To achieve this objective, we propose a new framework that comprises (1) a modeling paradigm for secure CPS representation, easily usable by system architects with limited cybersecurity expertise, (2) an attack-graph-based solution for CPS automatic quantitative security analysis, based on the MulVAL security tool formalisms, (3) a model-based code generator tool - a set of Model-To-Text (MTT) transformation rules to bridge the gap between the CPS specific extensions of SysML and MulVAL. We illustrated the ability of our proposed framework to model, analyze, and identify attacks in CPS s through an autonomous ventilation system example. The results confirm that the framework can accurately represent CPS and their vulnerabilities. Attack scenarios, including a Denial of Service ( DoS ) attack targeting an industrial communication protocol, were identified and displayed as attack graphs. Furthermore, success probabilities were computed to assess the level of risk quantitatively. In future work, we intend to ex- tend the approach to connect it to dynamic security databases and address challenges such as automatic countermeasure selection.

 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in safeguarding systems and networks from different types of attacks. However, IDSes face significant hurdles in detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which are sophisticated cyber-attacks characterized by their stealth, duration, and advanced techniques. Recent research has explored the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in APT detection, leveraging their ability to analyse intricate-relationships within graph data. However, existing approaches often rely on local models, limiting their adaptability to evolving APT-tactics and raising privacy-concerns. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes integrating Federated-Learning (FL) into the architectures of GNN-based Intrusion Detection Systems. Federated Learning is a distributed-learning paradigm that enables collaborative model-training without centralizing sensitive-data. By leveraging FL, hosts can contribute to a collective knowledge-base while preserving the confidentiality of their local datasets. This approach not only mitigates hardware strain and addresses privacy concerns; but also enhances model robustness by capturing diverse-insights from multiple sources. Moreover, our solution includes an enhanced encryption-system of the clients’ weights to safely send them to the server through the system’s network. This solution prevents man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks from intercepting the weights and reconstructing clients data using reverse engineering. We evaluate our approach on several datasets, demonstrating promising results in reducing false-positive rates compared to state-of-the-art Provenance-based IDSes (PIDS).

 The growing importance of Information Technology (IT) services is accompanied by a surge in security challenges. While traditional security tests focus on single applications, today's interconnected systems require a broader evaluation. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) is a method to tackle this, aiming to assess whole systems thoroughly. However, performing VAPT manually is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, there's a strong need for automating these processes. In response to these challenges, a novel methodology, named ESSecA built upon existing literature to guide the penetration testers during the assessment of a system based on threat intelligence mechanisms. This paper presents enhancements to the ESSecA methodology, including a formal Penetration Test Plan (PTP) model, a taxonomy for Penetration Test phases, and an innovative pattern match system integrated with a Tool Catalogue knowledge base used to improve the Expert System. These developments culminated in an algorithm facilitating the automatic generation of Penetration Test Plans, thus advancing the automation of security assessment processes.

While existing approaches often rely on embedding graphs in Euclidean space, recent studies have suggested that hyperbolic space provides a more suitable geometry for capturing the inherent hierarchical and complex relationships present in graph data. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of hyperbolic graph embedding for anomaly detection in the context of cybersecurity. We conduct a comparison of six state-of-the-art hyperbolic graph embedding methods, evaluating their performance on a well-known intrusion detection dataset. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of each method, demonstrating the potential of hyperbolic graph embedding for enhancing security.

 Full Paper    

 Transport Layer Security protocol is widely used nowadays to secure communication channels in various applications running in network, IoT, and embedded systems environments. In the last decade, several attacks affecting the TLS specification, the implementation, the cryptographic vulnerabilities, or the deployment of the TLS-enabled software have been discovered. Although solutions exist for each class of attacks, an attacker may corrupt the TLS support on an end node (even temporarily) making it vulnerable to attacks. To test the resistance of a TLS server to attacks several tools or services exist, that mainly scan a target host looking for wrong configurations. We propose instead a network-based intrusion detection tool named Threat-TLS, aimed to individuate weak, suspicious, or malicious TLS connections. Attackers might establish such connections to hide and distribute potentially dangerous data content, like malware. Alternatively, weak TLS connections could be opened by (legitimate) systems or servers that have been compromised and are prone to TLS attacks, such as systems whose TLS configuration has been changed to use an old TLS version or outdated cryptographic algorithms. We have tested the proposed tool in a testbed environment, illustrating its performance in detecting some TLS attacks.

 In the contemporary environment, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are becoming necessary. They are absolutely vital in a variety of situations where setting up a network quickly is required; however, this is infeasible due to low resources. Ad hoc networks have many applications: education, on the front lines of battle, rescue missions, etc. These networks are distinguished by high mobility and constrained compute, storage, and energy capabilities. As a result of a lack of infrastructure, they do not use communication tools related to infrastructure. Instead, these networks rely on one another for routing and communication. Each node in a MANET searches for another node within its communication range and uses it as a hop to relay the message through a subsequent node, and so on. Traditional networks have routers, servers, firewalls, and specialized hardware. In contrast, each node in ad hoc networks has multiple functions. Nodes, for instance, manage the routing operation. Consequently, they are more vulnerable to attacks than traditional networks. This study's main goal is to develop an approach for detecting blackhole attacks using anomaly detection based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). This detection system looks at node activity to scan network traffic for irregularities. In blackhole scenarios, attacking nodes have distinct behavioral characteristics that distinguish them from other nodes. These traits can be efficiently detected by the proposed SVM-based detection system. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, traffic under blackhole attack is created using the OMNET++ simulator. Based on the categorization of the traffic into malicious and non-malicious, the malicious node is then identified. The results of the suggested approach show great accuracy in detecting blackhole attacks.

 Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to aid in closing the knowledge gap in several specific technical areas, such as cybersecurity, by providing a means to translate instructions defined in natural language into specialized system or software specifications (e.g., firewall rules). The work described herein aims at an evaluation of the capability of LLMs to generate rules for firewall and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).  
   
  A preliminary evaluation has shown that widely available chat bots have limited capability to generate correct rules and that caution is needed when using their outputs for the aforementioned objective.  
   
  This work explores three fine-tuning approaches to address these limitations, each of them with a different objective and achieving different success rates. The first approach aimed at testing how well the model was able to use the knowledge obtained from the prompts when the question was structured differently, achieving a success rate of 89%. The second approach aimed at testing how well the model could link the knowledge obtained from two different prompts and reached a success rate of 61%. The final approach aimed at testing if the model could create complex rules by first learning simple rules, achieving a success rate of 79%.  
   
  It can be concluded that fine-tuning is sufficient to improve chat bots into creating syntactically and technically correct rules for firewalls and IDS. Results suggest that the development of a specialized model for as many attacks, firewalls and IDSs can indeed be achieved.

 DICE is a Trusted Computing standard intended to secure resource-constrained off-the-shelf hardware. It implements a Root of Trust that can be used to construct a Chain of Trust boot system, with symmetric keys representing firmware integrity and device identity. Based on this, asymmetric keys can be generated, but this slows down the boot process significantly as the keys need to be generated on every boot. Asymmetric keys provide multiple advantages when compared to symmetric ones, especially for updatable systems. This prevents the adoption of DICE in fields with strict boot time requirements, for example in the automotive context.  
   
  Boot times can be accelerated if keys can be cached in flash memory. However, keys must not be accessible if the state of the system changes, as otherwise the keys would not represent the state anymore. We implement two approaches for this and evaluate them on multiple MCUs regarding automotive requirements.

 Time is an often recurring quasi-identifying attribute in many datasets. Anonymizing such datasets requires generalizing the time attribute(s) in the dataset. Examples are start dates and durations, which are traditionally generalized leading to intervals that do not embrace the relation between time attributes. This paper presents advanced methods for creating generalization hierarchies for time data. We propose clustering-based and Mondrian-based techniques to construct generalization hierarchies. These approaches take into account the relation between different time attributes and are designed to improve the utility of the anonymized data. We implemented these methods and conducted a set of experiments comparing them to traditional generalization strategies. The results show that our proposed methods improve the utility of the data for both statistical analysis and machine learning applications. Our approach demonstrates a significant increase in hierarchy quality and configuration flexibility, demonstrating the potential of our advanced techniques over existing methods.

ARGAN-IDS is implemented as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on network traffic to protect NIDS. ARGAN-IDS, greatly mitigates the impact of AAs, achieving comparable results to a non-perturbed execution. We show GANs have limitations in differentiating between malicious traffic and traffic altered by AAs. And we address this in ARGAN-IDS by training the GAN on network traffic containing malicious packets. This enhancement significantly improved the GAN’s performance, enabling it to identify even highly perturbed adversarial attacks effectively. ARGAN-IDS acts as a neutralizer of perturbations introduced by AAs and mitigates the NIDS vulnerabilities. We have integrated ARGAN-IDS with a state-of-the-art anomaly-based detector, Kitsune. We achieve a reduction of 99.27% of false positives and an improvement of 99.29% of the true negatives, leading to an improvement of roughly 36.75% in overall system accuracy while under AAs.

 Just Rewrite It Again: A Post-Processing Method for Enhanced Semantic Similarity and Privacy Preservation of Differentially Private Rewritten Text   
 Stephen Meisenbacher  (Technical University of Munich, Germany), Florian Matthes  (Technical University of Munich, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 The study of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural Language Processing often views the task of text privatization as a rewriting task, in which sensitive input texts are rewritten to hide explicit or implicit private information. In order to evaluate the privacy-preserving capabilities of a DP text rewriting mechanism, empirical privacy tests are frequently employed. In these tests, an adversary is modeled, who aims to infer sensitive information (e.g., gender) about the author behind a (privatized) text. Looking to improve the empirical protections provided by DP rewriting methods, we propose a simple post-processing method based on the goal of aligning rewritten texts with their original counterparts, where DP rewritten texts are rewritten again. Our results shown that such an approach not only produces outputs that are more semantically reminiscent of the original inputs, but also texts which score on average better in empirical privacy evaluations. Therefore, our approach raises the bar for DP rewriting methods in their empirical privacy evaluations, providing an extra layer of protection against malicious adversaries.

 Full Paper    

 Anonymity and pseudonymity are important concepts in the domain of the Internet of Things. The existing privacy-preserving key agreement schemes are only concerned with maintaining the privacy of the communicated data that appears on the channel established between two honest entities. However, privacy should also include anonymity or pseudonymity of the device identity. This means there should not exist any correlation handle to associate different communications done by the device.  
   
  This paper proposes a privacy-preserving key agreement method, called Pseudonymous Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol (PAKA), that also provides device unlinkability across different domains. This protocol is based on an Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman using standard cryptographic primitives and curves, i.e., no pairing-based cryptography or other computationally intensive cryptography is necessary.  
   
  For the security analysis, we provide a mathematical proof and an automatic cryptographic protocol verification utilizing Proverif. Last, we show the integration with the Trusted Platform Module and a Proof-of-Concept implementation.

 Alexios Lekidis  (University of Thessaly, Greece)   
 Full Paper    

 The sixth generation of telecommunication network (6G) offers even faster data rates, lower latency, greater reliability, and higher device density than the currently available 5G infrastructure. Nevertheless, simultaneously to these advancements include several challenges in different domains slowing substantially the transition to it. Hence, 3GPP opts to gradually tackle these challenges in a second phase 5G Advanced release. One of the most significant challenges amongst them lies in the constantly increasing threat landscape from the use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies for offering services over a shared mobile infrastructure. A mechanism that allows protection against attacks over established network slices is network isolation. This paper proposes isolation schemes to tackle the threats that arise in 5G slices. Such schemes are integrated in a Slice Manager components, responsible for the implementation of a fully-automated orchestration and lifecycle management of network slices as well as their individual network segments. The schemes are implemented through Quality of Service (QoS) policies in an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, which includes the EV charging stations, the management platform, a Slice Manager on the edge segment as well as the orchestration components in a Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) network slice.

This synergy promises to revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare and transportation to manufacturing and agriculture. However, with the proliferation of connected devices and the exponential growth of data transmission, the cybersecurity landscape faces increasingly complex challenges. One of the primary rationales for the implementation of a 5G-IoT Cyber Range lies in the imperative need for comprehensive training programs tailored to the unique characteristics of 5G and IoT technologies. Unlike traditional networks, 5G infrastructure introduces novel architectural paradigms, including network slicing and edge computing, which demand specialized skill sets among cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, the heterogeneity and sheer volume of IoT devices exacerbate the attack surface, rendering conventional cybersecurity methodologies inadequate. Challenges such as interoperability issues, resource constraints, and the dynamic nature of IoT deployments further compound the complexity of securing 5G-enabled IoT ecosystems.

 The work reflects about the importance of trust in data exchanges in the context of ever-increasing distributed computing ecosystems. It proposes the utilisation of an open-source technology that implements a direct acyclic graph incorporating peer nodes to validate messages in a decentralised network. The tool, IOTA, promises to solve the hindrances of blockchain solutions in highly heterogeneous, IoT-assimilable scenarios, adopting a more lightweight approach, removing the need of mining. The article explores the functioning of IOTA in distributed computing continuum cases, understanding the figures and mechanisms that govern the process. The authors link those reflections to the direct transfer into a research project, aerOS, that uses such a tool as intrinsic part of an IoT-Edge-Cloud continuum framework, enabling the immutability and non-repudiation of key messages in such environments. Also, the authors conclude analysing which next steps might follow to evolve from a not-fully decentralised implementation with the next releases of the tool, and the adaptations for the studied application.

 Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies are recently introduced to provide enhanced connectivity between the different smart grid segments as well as Electric Vehicles (EVs). The EVs draw or power to the grid and may be used as an energy flexibility resource for households and buildings. The increased number of interconnections through is augmenting substantially the cyber-security and data privacy threats that may occur in the V2X ecosystem. In this paper, such threats are categorized in cyber-attack classes which serve as a basis to derive Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for the V2X ecosystem. Additionally, the sensitive data that are exchanged in charging and discharging scenarios are reviewed. Then, an analysis of the existing cyber-security mechanisms is provided and further mechanisms/tools are proposed for detecting/preventing the categorized threats, which are being developed in an Open V2X Management Platform (O-V2X-MP) within the EV4EU project. These mechanisms will provide security-by-design in the O-V2X-MP offered services as well as ensure protection in the V2X interactions.

CDRs encompass a vast array of metadata, including the date, time, duration, source, destination of calls, and more specific details like service type, call status, and location data. Through a meticulous examination, this paper highlights the significant potential of CDRs in various applications, ranging from telecom fraud detection, urban planning, disaster readiness, to novel methodologies for predicting socio-economic metrics like poverty. We discuss specific use cases, demonstrating the critical role of CDRs in identifying SIM box fraud, analyzing urban mobility, and enhancing emergency response strategies through sophisticated data analysis techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CDR Generator Solution developed within the RITHMS project (G.A. 101073932) aimed at detecting suspicious activities around archaeological sites. The tool leverages modern technologies, including Python, Streamlit, and Folium, to generate synthetic CDRs based on selected geographic areas, demonstrating the applicability of CDRs in safeguarding cultural heritage. By integrating theoretical insights with practical applications, this paper underscores the versatility of CDRs in advancing not only telecommunications but also broader societal objectives.

 Full Paper    

 Implementing strong authentication methods in a network requires stable connectivity between the service providers deployed within the network (i.e., applications that users of the network need to access) and the Identity and Access Management (IAM) server located at the core segment of the network. This becomes challenging when it comes to Operational Technology (OT) systems deployed in a remote area, as they often get disconnected from the core segment of the network owing to unavoidable network disruptions. As a result, weak authentication methods and shared credential approaches are still adopted in these OT environments, exposing system vulnerabilities to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In this work, we propose a solution to enable highly available multi-factor authentication (MFA) services for OT environments. The proposed solution is based on Proof-of-Possession (PoP) tokens generated by an IAM server for registered users. The tokens are securely linked to user-specific parameters (e.g., physical security keys, biometrics, PIN, etc.), enabling strong user authentication (during disconnection time) through token validation. We deployed the Tamarin Prover software-based toolkit to verify security of the proposed authentication scheme. For performance evaluation, we implemented the designed solution in real-world settings. The results of our analysis and experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed solution.

 The increasing digitization of modern flexible manufacturing systems has opened up new possibilities for higher levels of automation, paving the way for innovative concepts such as Equipment-as-a-Service. Concurrently, remote access has gained traction, notably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While some areas of manufacturing have embraced these advancements, safety applications remain localized. This work aims to enable the remote reset of local safety events. To identify necessary requirements, we conducted collaborative expert-workshops and analyzed relevant standards and regulations. These requirements serve as the foundation for a comprehensive security and safety concept, built around a Secure Gateway. It uses secure elements, crypto-agility, PQC, and certificates for secure and authentic communication. To show the applicability, we implemented a prototype, which utilizes a gateway, cameras, and light barriers to monitor the danger zone of a robot and thus enable remote reset via public Internet. The real-world limitations we faced, were used to refine our requirements and concept iteratively. Ultimately, we present a secure and safe solution that enables the remote acknowledgment of safety-critical applications.

 As the historically isolated industrial control systems become increasingly connected, the threat posed by cyberattacks soars. To remedy this issue, industrial standards dedicated to the cybersecurity of ICS have been developed in the last twenty years, namely the IEC 62443 series. These standards provides guidelines to the creation and maintenance of a secure ICS, from the concept phase to its eventual disposal. This standard notably assume a specific Zone/Conduit model for systems, as a basis for building the security program. This model currently lacks computer-aided design tools, which are essential to the adoption of a standard. In this paper, we will present a domain specific modeling language, able to describe IEC 62443 compliant systems. Our main contributions are the DSL's syntax, which tries to formalize the informal model found in the standard, and the validation rules applied to it that ensure the described installations are secure by design, according to a set of hypotheses.

 The identification of industrial devices based on their behavior in network communication is important from a cybersecurity perspective in two areas: attack prevention and digital forensics. In both areas, device identification falls under asset management or asset tracking. Due to the impact of active scanning on these networks, particularly in terms of latency, it is important to take care in industrial networks to use passive scanning. For passive identification, statistical learning algorithms are nowadays the most appropriate. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the potential for passive identification of PLC devices using statistical learning based on network communication, specifically the payload of the packet. Individual statistical parameters from 15 minutes of traffic based on payload entropy were used to create the features. Three scenarios were performed and the XGBoost algorithm was used for evaluation. In the best of the scenarios, the model achieved an accuracy score of 83% to identify individual devices.

 In the era of growing threats posed by the development of quantum computers, ensuring the security of electronic services has become fundamental. The ongoing standardization process led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) emphasizes the necessity for quantum-resistant security measures. However, the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) schemes, including advanced schemes such as threshold signatures, faces challenges due to their large key sizes and high computational complexity, particularly on constrained devices. This paper introduces two microcontroller-tailored optimization approaches, focusing on enhancing the DS2 threshold signature scheme. These optimizations aim to reduce memory consumption while maintaining security strength, specifically enabling the implementation of DS2 on microcontrollers with only 192 KB of RAM. Experimental results and security analysis demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of our solution, facilitating the deployment of DS2 threshold signatures on resource-constrained microcontrollers.

 The proliferation of security threats in connected systems necessitates innovative approaches to enhance security resilience. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents a rapidly evolving and interconnected ecosystem that raises unprecedented security challenges, including remote hijacking, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Digital Twin (DT) and blockchain-based deception can emerge as a promising approach to enhance the security of the IoV ecosystem by creating a secure, realistic, dynamic, and interactive deceptive environment that can deceive and disrupt malicious actors. In accordance with this, we propose a proactive security approach for IoV by leveraging DECEPtion-based digiTal tWins and blockchaIN (DECEPTWIN) that entails hunting for security threats and gaps in IoV security posture before an incident or breach occurs.

 With increasing smart transportation systems and services, potential security and privacy threats are growing. In this work, we analyze privacy and security threats in car-sharing systems, and discuss the problems with the transparency of services, users' personal data collection, and how the legislation manages these issues. Based on analyzed requirements, we design a compact privacy-preserving solution for car-sharing systems. Our proposal combines digital signature schemes and group signature schemes, in order to protect user privacy against curious providers, increase security and non-repudiation, and be efficient even for systems with restricted devices. The evaluation of the proposed solution demonstrates its security and a practical usability for constrained devices deployed in vehicles and users' smartphones.

 The Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a widely accepted industry standard for reliably exchanging data over the network using a publish-subscribe model. While DDS already includes basic security features such as participant authentication and access control, the possibilities of leveraging Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) to increase the security and trustworthiness of DDS-based applications have not been sufficiently researched yet. In this work, we show how TPM-based remote attestation can be effectively integrated into the existing DDS security architecture. This enables application developers to verify the code integrity of remote DDS participants during the operation of the distributed system. Our solution transparently extends the DDS secure channel handshake, while cryptographically binding the established communication channels to the attested software stacks. We show the security properties of our proposal by formally verifying the resulting remote attestation protocol using the Tamarin theorem prover. We also implement our solution as a fork of the popular eProsima FastDDS library and evaluate the resulting performance impact when conducting TPM-based remote attestations of DDS applications.

 The practicality of IoT is becoming more and more apparent, including smart homes, autonomous vehicles, environmental monitoring, and the internet everywhere. The rapid spread has also lead to a large number of cybersecurity threats such as Denial of Service attacks, Information stealing attacks, and so on. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be a valuable tool for detecting network threats in IoT. Feature selection has been proven to overcome excessive features of the dataset in the feature reduction phase, which helps reducing computational costs while still keeping the generalization of machine learning model. However, most existing studies have only focused on using a limited number of methods for feature selection (typically one). Moreover, there is very few research evaluating which technique is the most effective across various datasets, and can be used as a best choice method in general. Therefore, this work aims to test 5 feature selection techniques: Random Forest, Recursive Feature Elimination, Logistic Regression, XGBoost Regression and Information Gain. The new dataset (CIC-IoT 2023) is applied to evaluate the performance of those feature selection methods. This study also performs IoT attacks detection based on 5 Machine learning models: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Gradient Boosting (GB) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). We look at the computational metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score to evaluate the performance of each technique over three actual datasets. Overall, the research shows that Recursive Feature Elimination stands out as the top feature selection method, achieving the average accuracy of 95.55%, as well as the highest accuracy of 99.57% when being used in combination with RF in case of 30 selected features.

 Vehicles are taking a major step towards connected transportation with advanced applications and robust security frameworks. Despite growth in networking potential in the automotive industry, security and privacy vulnerabilities continue to plague the industry. Internet of Vehicles, one of the subsets of cyber-physical systems, can utilize smart sensors to collect and synthesize data from connected vehicles. This technological development contributes to seamless information exchange between drivers, manufacturers, insurers, and service providers. For effective IoV systems, optimizing spectrum usage, allocating quality channels judiciously, and using infrastructure efficiently to maintain connectivity under changing traffic conditions are essential. However, security and privacy remain the main concerns of these communication networks. With the advent of blockchain technology, the world of cryptocurrency transactions can benefit from a secure communication framework that can alleviate these concerns. We propose integrating blockchain technology into IoV infrastructure in order to facilitate secure, reliable, and trust-enhancing communication between vehicles. We utilize a distributed access control system in order to ensure scalable and strategic decision-making processes. Our results and evaluation show that the use of distributed storage across cloud platforms helps enhance data security, enabling vehicles to exchange information safely.

 The widespread deployment of surveillance cameras, responding to the increasing demand for scene investigation, video forensics, and analytics in urban environments, necessitates the storage and accurate retrieval of required video shots for post-verification. Conventional CCTV systems lack intelligent data storage, resulting in substantial volumes of data. This massive volume of video data (big data) poses a challenge in searching and retrieving needed information for video content analysis (VCA). Moreover, surveillance videos often contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about individuals, raising concerns about privacy and data protection. Data protection is vital for ethics and a fundamental human right. European regulatory authorities have enforced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to safeguard individuals’ privacy rights and mitigate security threats. GDPR emphasizes data minimisation by collecting the minimum amount of personal data needed to deliver an individual service element. However, there is no mechanism to preserve the privacy of stored videos along with minimisation. Therefore, several ethical issues arise, limiting the use of automated surveillance systems. This work proposes a multi-layered security framework by integrating summarisation and attribute-based searchable encryption to provide optimal secure storage and intelligently filter out desired video clips from the encrypted videos by employing a text-to-video retrieval technique, making it a resource-efficient and GDPR-compliant secure evidence management system.

 There is a growing concern about the dynamic landscape of cyber security threats escalating, and the need for improvement in defence capabilities against emerging sophisticated incidents. In response, this paper presents a solution called the Cyber Incident Simulation System, which enables system security engineers to simulate cyber-physical attacks and incidents without the requirement to affect or disrupt the ongoing business operation of the system. Leveraging graph-based threat modelling and AI-generated incident data, the system empowers professionals to predict the effect of the incident within the system under study. The synthetic data is used by anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and other additional security controls to improve their detection algorithms to enhance their accuracy and effectiveness. The Cyber Incident Simulation System is designed to enhance the cyber security measures through the simulation of various incident scenarios.

 Passports are part of critical infrastructure for a very long time. They also have been pieces of automatically processable information devices, more recently through the ISO/IEC 14443 (Near-Field Communication - NFC) protocol. For obvious reasons, it is crucial that the information stored on devices are sufficiently protected. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specifies exactly what information should be stored on electronic passports (also Machine Readable Travel Documents - MRTDs) and how and under which conditions they can be accessed. We propose a model-based approach for checking the conformance with this specification in an automated and very comprehensive manner: we use automata learning to learn a full model of passport documents and use equivalence checking techniques (trace equivalence and bisimlarity) to check the conformance with an automaton modeled after the ICAO standard. The result is an automated (non-interactive), yet very thorough test for compliance. This approach can also be used with other applications for which a specification automaton can be modeled and is therfore broadly applicable.

 Full Paper    

 Machine learning (ML) has been widely used in network security monitoring. Although, its application to highly data intensive use cases and those requiring ultra-low latency remains challenging. It is caused by the large amounts of network data and the need of transferring data to a central location hosting analyses services.  
   
  In this paper, we present a framework to perform in-network analysis by offloading ML inference tasks from end servers to P4-capable programmable network devices. This helps reducing transfer latency and, thus, allows faster attack detection and mitigation. It also improves privacy since the data is processed at the networking devices.  
   
  The paper also presents an experimental use-case of the framework to classify network traffic, and to early detect and rapidly mitigate against IoT malicious traffic.

 In the last few decades, the increasing adoption of computer systems for monitoring and control applications has fostered growing attention to real-time behavior, i.e., the property that ensures predictable reaction times to external events. In this perspective, performance of the interrupt management mechanisms are among the most relevant aspects to be considered. Therefore, the service-latency of interrupts is one of the metrics considered while assessing the predictability of such systems. To this purpose, there are different techniques to estimate it, including the use of on-board timers, oscilloscopes and logic analyzers, or even real-time tracers. Each of these techniques, however, is affected by some degrees of inaccuracy, and choosing one over the other have pros and cons. In this paper, we review methodologies for measuring interrupt-latency from the scientific literature and, for the first time, we define an analytical model that we exploit to figure out measurement errors committed. Finally, we prove the effectiveness of the model relying on measurements taken from Xilinx MPSoC devices and present a case study whose purpose is to validate the proposed model.

 The cybersecurity landscape is fraught with challenges stemming from the increasing volume and complexity of security alerts. Traditional manual or semi-automated approaches to threat analysis and incident response often result in significant delays in identifying and mitigating security threats. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing AI4SOAR, a security intelligence tool for automated incident response. AI4SOAR leverages similarity learning techniques and integrates seamlessly with the open-source SOAR platform Shuffle. We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing open-source SOAR platforms, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we present a similarity-based learning approach to quickly identify suitable playbooks for incoming alerts. We implement AI4SOAR and demonstrate its application through a use case for automated incident response against SSH brute-force attacks.

 Full Paper    

 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of domains, including computer vision and healthcare. However, they encounter challenges related to the increasing demands for resources and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Despite the significance of these challenges, they are often addressed independently in the scientific literature, which has led to conflicting findings.  
   
  In addressing the issue of resource demands, approaches have been developed which leverage the inherent error resilience of DNNs. The Approximate Computing (AxC) design paradigm reduces the resource requirements of DNNs by introducing controlled errors. With regard to the security domain, the objective is to develop precise adversarial attacks.  
   
  This paper introduces a novel technique for transferring adversarial attacks from CNN approximated through the AxC design paradigm (AxNNs), and other CNNs, regardless of their architecture and implementations. AxNNs are created by replacing components that require significant resources with approximate ones. Subsequently, adversarial attacks are generated targeting AxNNs and transferred to new CNNs.  
   
  The experimental results indicate that it is possible to transfer adversarial samples from an AxNN to target CNNs, especially whne the source AxNN has either a high accuracy, or an architecture that is deeper than the ones of the target CNNs.

 In the domain of cybersecurity, effective threat intelligence and information sharing are critical operations for ensuring appropriate and timely response against threats, but limited in automation, standardization, and user-friendliness in current platforms. This paper introduces a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Information Sharing platform, designed for critical infrastructures and cyber-physical systems. Our platform integrates existing cybersecurity tools and leverages digital twin technology, enhancing threat analysis and mitigation capabilities. It features an automated process for disseminating standardized and structured intelligence, utilizing the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) for effective dissemination. A significant enhancement is the integration of risk assessment tools, which enriches the shared intelligence with detailed risk information, supporting an informed decision-making. The platform encompasses an user-friendly dashboard and a robust backend, streamlining the threat intelligence cycle and transforming raw data coming from diverse sources into actionable insights. Overall the CTI4BC platform presents a solution to overcome challenges in the CTI sharing, contributing to a more resilient cybersecurity domain.

 Critical infrastructures (CIs) are equipped with sensors and actuators which communicate using open (for e.g., MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, Modbus, DNP3) or commercially licensed protocols (LoRA, IEC 6870-5-101, Profibus) to share data and commands. The management of these systems are also built on Information Communication Technologies (ICT) which are considered as Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). As identified by a recent European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) study, the software used in CIs are subjected to supply chain compromise of software dependencies, human error (misconfigurations), ransomware attack, Artificial Intelligence abuse, the usage of legacy systems inside cyber-physical systems within CIs.

 Software testing is vital for strengthening the security of embedded systems by identifying and rectifying code errors, flaws and vulnerabilities. This is particularly significant when addressing vulnerabilities associated with side-channel attacks, given that they introduce a distinctive class of vulnerabilities, primarily subject to manual testing procedures. Manual testing remains prevalent despite advances in automation, posing challenges, particularly for complex environments. This research aims to automate embedded software testing on hardware in a modular and scalable manner, addressing the limitations of manual testing. We present a system designed to automate testing, including Side-Channel Analysis (SCA), in Continuous Integration (CI) environments, emphasizing accessibility and collaboration through open-source tools. Our evaluation setup based on GitLab, Jenkins and the ChipWhisperer framework shows that automating and integrating SCA in CI environments is possible in an efficient way.

 As critical cyber-physical systems, urban transport systems are vul- nerable to natural disasters and deliberate attacks. Ensuring their resilience is crucial for sustainable operations and includes the abil- ity to withstand, absorb and recover efficiently from disruptions. Assessing the resilience of such systems requires a comprehensive set of performance indicators covering social, economic, organi- sational, environmental and technical concerns. In addition, the interdependence of the different modes of transport and the result- ing human activities requires the inclusion of the spatial dimension to capture potential cascading failures. Furthermore, the integration of both aleatory (data) and epistemic (modelling) uncertainties is essential for robust performance indicators.  
   
  Current methods for assessing the resilience of transport systems lack standardised performance indicator systems and assessment methods, making comparative analysis and benchmarking of dis- ruption management strategies difficult. This paper proposes a unified framework for modelling and assessing performance indica- tors for urban transport systems. The framework is demonstrated using a simulated scenario in Eclipse SUMO and paves the way for future research in this area.

 Full Paper    

 Artificial intelligence systems like large language models (LLM) source their knowledge from large datasets. Systems like ChatGPT therefore rely on shared data to train on. For enterprises, releasing data to the public domain requires anonymization as soon as a individual is identifiable. While multiple privacy models exist that guarantee a specific level of distortion applied to a dataset, to mitigate re-identification with e.g. k-anonymity, the required level is in general defined by the data processor. We propose the idea to combine individual privacy levels defined by the data subjects themselves with a privacy language such as LPL (Gerl et al., 2018) to get a more fine-granular understanding of the effectively required privacy level. Queries targeting subsets of the to be released dataset can only profit from lower privacy requirements set by data subjects as these response subsets may do not contain users with high privacy requirements, which can then lead to more utility. By analyzing the results of different queries directed at a privacy-aware data-transforming database system, we demonstrate the characteristics needed for this assumption to really take effect. For a more realistic evaluation we also take changes of the underlying data sources in consideration.

 Full Paper    

 On 29 February 2024, the European Parliament approved the amendment of the eIDAS Regulation. The revision introduces new elements and a new EU Digital Identity Wallet, expected to be ready by the end of 2026. Even after the wallet is released, the numerous digital identity schemes operating within the Member States will continue to function for some time. The introduction of the new wallet and the coexistence of numerous digital identity schemes will pose challenges for service providers, who will need to adapt to support various means of identity, including the EU wallet, for their services. In response to this challenge, this study examines how to plan interoperability between eIDAS and existing frameworks. First, we organize the eIDAS components in a knowledge graph that encodes information through entities and their relations. While doing this, we highlight various design patterns and use a graph entity alignment method to map components of eIDAS and the Trust Over IP.

 Full Paper    

 In parallel with the rapid development of Information and Communication technologies and the digitization of information in every aspect of daily life, the enforcement of the GDPR, in May 2018, brought significant changes to the processes that organisations should follow during collecting, processing, and storing personal data and revealed the immediate need for integrating the Regulation’s requirements for integrating into organisational activities that process personal and sensitive data. On the other hand, cloud computing is a cutting-edge technology that is widely used in order to support most, if not every, organisational activities. As a result, such infrastructure constitutes huge pools of personal data and, in this context, a careful consideration and implementation of the rules imposed by the Regulation is considered crucial. In this paper, after highlighting the need to consider the GDPR requirements when designing cloud-based systems, we determined those GDPR compliance controls that should be incorporated at the early stages of the system design process. As a next step, those compliance controls were integrated into a holistic framework that considers both the security and privacy aspects of a cloud-based system as well as the requirements arising from the Regulation during the design of such systems.

 Full Paper    

 Separation of Duty (SoD) is a fundamental principle in information security. Especially large and highly regulated companies have to manage a huge number of SoD policies. These policies need to be maintained in an ongoing effort in order to remain accurate and compliant with regulatory requirements. In this work we develop a framework for managing SoD policies that pays particular attention to policy comprehensibility. We conducted seven semi-structured interviews with SoD practitioners from large organizations in order to understand the requirements for managing and maintaining SoD policies. Drawing from the obtained insights, we developed a framework, which includes the relevant stakeholders and tasks, as well as a policy structure that aims to simplify policy maintenance. We anchor the proposed policy structure in a generic IAM data model to ensure compatibility and flexibility with other IAM models. We then show exemplary how our approach can be enforced within Role-Based Access Control. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework with a real-world IAM data set provided by a large finance company.

 In this paper, we present further contributions to the field of privacy-preserving and explainable data analysis applied to tabular datasets. Our approach defines a comprehensive optimization criterion that balances the key aspects of data privacy, model explainability, and data utility. By carefully regulating the privacy parameter and exploring various configurations, our methodology identifies the optimal trade-off that maximizes privacy gain and explainability similarity while minimizing any adverse impact on data utility. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using five classifiers on a binary classification problem using the well-known Adult dataset, which contains sensitive attributes. We employed (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy with generative adversarial networks as a privacy mechanism and incorporated various model explanation methods. The results showcase the capabilities of our approach in achieving the dual objectives of preserving data privacy and generating model explanations.

 Article 45 of the new eIDAS Directive (eIDAS 2.0) is causing a bit of shock on the Internet as it gives European governments the power to make EU-certificated web certificates accepted without the approval of web browsers/OS, which are considered to be the current gatekeepers of the WebPKI ecosystem. This paper goes beyond the current debate between the WebPKI gatekeepers and the European Commission (EC) about the implications of Article 45. It shows how both approaches do not provide full protection to web users. We propose a better approach that Europe can follow to regulate web X.509 certificates: Rather than regulating the issuance of web X.509 certificates, the EC can play the role of a validator that recommends the acceptance of certificates at the web scale.

 Full Paper    

 Create, Read, Update and Delete operations (CRUD) are a well-established abstraction to model data access in software systems of different architectures. Most system requirements, generated during the specification phase, will be realized by combining these operations on different entities of the system under development. The majority of these requirements will be business operations and objectives. Security requirements come on top of business requirements in a mostly network-connected world and risk the existence of a software system as a business. Through the enforcement of privacy laws, modern systems must also legally comply with privacy requirements or face the possibility of high fines. While there is a great interest in methodologies to elicit security and privacy requirements, little has been done to practically apply those requirements during the software development phase. This paper investigates the implication of those four basic operations regarding security and privacy principles as they are implied by the law. Analysis findings aim to raise awareness among developers about privacy when implementing high-level business requirements, and result in a bottom-up compliance procedure regarding privacy and the GDPR by proposing a systematic approach in this direction.

 Counterfactual explanations are a promising direction of explainable AI in many domains such as healthcare. These explanations produce a counterexample from the dataset that shows, for example, what should change about a patient to reduce their risk of developing diabetes type 2. However, this poses a clear privacy risk when the dataset contains information about people. Recent literature shows that this risk can be mitigated by using $k$-anonymity to generalise the explanation, such that it is not about a single person. In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between privacy and explanation quality in the medical domain. Our results show that for around 40\% of the explained cases, the real gain in privacy is limited as the generalisation increases while the explanations continue decreasing in quality.  
   
  These findings suggest that this can be an unsuitable strategy in some situations, as its effectiveness depends on characteristics of the underlying dataset.

 Full Paper    

 Cybersecurity threats and attacks on Industry are increasing, and the outcome of a successful cyber-attack can be severe for organizations. A successful cyber-attack on an Industry where Cyber-Physical Systems are present can be particularly devastating as such systems could cause harm to people and the environment if they malfunction. This paper reports on the results of a survey investigating what security measures organizations implement within the industry to strengthen their security posture. The survey instrument used has been developed using the NIST Special Publication "Guide to Operational Technology" and contained 70 questions to determine the level of security controls deployed within the Norwegian Industry. The results show that the average usage of the different security controls is 63%, and 53% of the organizations have a security controls usage of 60% or more. The most used security control is backup of critical software, whereas the two least used are specific-OT cybersecurity training and response planning. Both are highlighted as areas for improvement. Dedicated OT security standards have not been found to influence the level of security controls used. However, employees within an organization following a dedicated security standard have higher cybersecurity knowledge.

 Full Paper    

 The electronic cash (or e-cash) technology based on the foundational work of Chaum is emerging as a scalability and privacy layer atop of expensive and traceable blockchain-based currencies. Unlike trustless blockchains, e-cash designs inherently rely on a trusted party with full control over the currency supply. Since this trusted component cannot be eliminated from the system, we aim to minimize the trust it requires.  
   
  We approach this goal from two angles. Firstly, we employ misuse-resistant hardware to mitigate the risk of compromise via physical access to the trusted device. Secondly, we divide the trusted device's capabilities among multiple independent devices, in a way that ensures unforgeability of its currency as long as at least a single device remains uncompromised. Finally, we combine both these approaches to leverage their complementary benefits.  
   
  In particular, we surveyed blind protocols used in e-cash designs with the goal of identifying those suitable for misuse-resistant, yet resource-constrained devices. Based on the survey, we focused on the BDHKE-based construction suitable for the implementation on devices with limited resources. Next, we proposed a new multi-party protocol for distributing the operations needed in BDHKE-based e-cash and analyzed its security. Finally, we implemented the protocol for the JavaCard platform and demonstrated the practicality of the approach by measuring its performance on a physical smartcard.

 The importance of automotive cybersecurity is increasing in tandem with the evolution of more complex vehicles, fueled by trends like V2X or over-the-air updates. Regulatory bodies are trying to cope with this problem with the introduction of ISO 21434, which standardizes automotive cybersecurity engineering. One piece of the puzzle for compliant cybersecurity engineering is the creation of a TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. The more time security experts invest in creating a TARA, the more detailed and mature it becomes. Thus, organizations must balance the benefits of a more mature TARA against the costs and resources required to achieve it. However, there is a lack of guidance on determining the appropriate level of effort. In this paper, we propose a data-driven maturity model as a management utility facilitating the decision on the maturity-cost trade-off for creating TARAs. To evaluate the model, we conducted interviews with seven automotive cybersecurity experts from the industry.

 Several security issues in open-source projects demonstrate that developer accounts get misused or stolen if weak authentication is used. Many services have started to enforce second-factor authentication (2FA) for their users. This is also the case for GitHub, the largest open-source development platform. We surveyed 110 open-source developers in GitHub to explore how they perceive the importance of authentication on GitHub. Our participants perceived secure authentication as important as other security mechanisms (e.g., commit signing) to improve open-source security. 2FA usage of the project owner was perceived as one of the most important mechanisms.  
   
  Around half of the participants (51%) were aware of the planned 2FA enforcement on GitHub. Their perception of this enforcement was rather positive. They agreed to enforce 2FA for new devices and new locations, but they were slightly hesitant to use it after some time. They also rather agreed to enforce various user groups on GitHub to use 2FA. Our participants also perceived GitHub authentication methods positively with respect to their usability and security. Most of our participants (68%) reported that they had enabled 2FA on their GitHub accounts.

 Full Paper    

 Trust is crucial when a truster allows a trustee to carry out desired services. Regulatory authorities thus set requirements for organizations under their jurisdiction to ensure a basic trust level. Trusted auditors periodically verify the auditee's compliance with these requirements. However, the quality of the auditees' compliance and the auditors' verification performance often remain unclear and unavailable to the public. In this work, we examine the regulations of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and identify typical patterns. We enhance these patterns to include trust measurements for the auditee providing services and the auditors verifying compliance. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for an application utilizing decentralized blockchain technologies and discuss the implications, potential, and benefits of this architecture.

 In order to perform cutting-edge research like AI model training, a large amount of data needs to be accessed. However, data providers are often reluctant to share their data with researchers as these might contain personal data and thereby sharing may introduce serious risks with significant personal, institutional or societal impacts. Apart from the need to control these risks, data providers must also comply with regulations like GDPR, which creates an additional overhead that makes data sharing even less appealing to data providers. Technologies like anonymization can play a critical role when sharing data that may contain personal information by offering privacy preservation measures like face or license plate anonymization. Therefore, we propose a framework to support data sharing of personal data for research by integrating anonymization, risk assessment and automatic licence agreement generation. The framework offers a practical and efficient solution for organisations seeking to enhance data-sharing practices without compromising information security.

 Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are widely deployed today and often use wireless communication. Establishing a secure communication channel to these devices is challenging in practice. To address this issue, researchers have proposed IMD key exchange protocols, particularly ones that leverage an Out-Of-Band (OOB) channel such as audio, vibration and physiological signals. While these solutions have advantages over traditional key exchange, they are often proposed in an ad-hoc manner and lack a systematic evaluation of their security, usability and deployability properties. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of existing OOB-based solutions for IMDs and, based on our findings, propose a novel IMD key exchange protocol that includes a new class of OOB channel based on human bodily motions. We implement prototypes and validate our designs through a user study (N = 24). The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and its unique features, establishing a new direction in the context of IMD security.

 Federated learning eliminates the necessity of transferring private training data and instead relies on the aggregation of model updates. Several publications on privacy attacks show how these individual model updates are vulnerable to the extraction of sensitive information. State-of-the-art secure aggregation protocols provide privacy for participating clients, yet, they are restrained by high computation and communication overhead.  
   
  We propose the efficient secure aggregation protocol DealSecAgg. The cryptographic scheme is based on a lightweight single-masking approach and allows the aggregation of the global model under encryption. DealSecAgg utilizes at least one additional dealer party to outsource the aggregation of masks and to reduce the computational complexity for mobile clients. At the same time, our protocol is scalable and resilient against client dropouts.  
   
  We provide a security proof and experimental results regarding the performance of DealSecAgg. The experimental evidence on the CIFAR-10 data set confirms that using our protocol, model utility remains unchanged compared to federated learning without secure aggregation. Furthermore, the results show how our work outperforms other state-of-the-art masking strategies both in the number of communication rounds per training step and in computational costs, which grows linearly in the amount of active clients. By employing our protocol, runtimes can be reduced by up to 87.8% compared to related work.

 Innovations in technology bring new challenges that need to be addressed, especially in the field of technical artifact discovery and analysis that enables digital forensic practitioners. Digital forensic analysis of these innovations is a constant challenge for digital investigators. In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence ( AI), keeping up with the digital forensic analysis of each new tool is a difficult task. New, advanced Large Language Model (LLM)s can produce human-like artifacts because of their complex textual processing capabilities. One of the newest innovations is a multi-agent LLM framework by Microsoft called AutoGen. AutoGen enables the creation of a team of specialist LLM-backed agents where the agents "chat" with each other to plan, iterate, and determine when a given task is complete. Typically one of the agents represents the human user while the other agents work autonomously after the human gives each agent a responsibility on the team. Thus, from a digital forensics perspective, it is necessary to determine which artifacts are created by the human user and which artifacts are created by the autonomous agents. Analysis in this work indicates that the current implementation of AutoGen has little in artifacts for attribution outside of particular memory artifacts, yet has strong indicators of usage in disk and network artifacts. Our research provides the initial account on the digital artifacts of the LLM technology AutoGen and first artifact examination for a LLM framework.

 Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in our daily lives as interconnection and automation positively impact our societal needs. In contrast to traditional devices, IoT devices require connectivity and data sharing to operate effectively. This interaction necessitates that data resides on multiple platforms and often across different locations, posing challenges from a digital forensic investigator’s perspective. Recovering a full trail of data requires piecing together elements from various devices and locations. IoT-based forensic investigations include an increasing quantity of objects of forensic interest, the uncertainty of device relevance in terms of digital artifacts or potential data, blurry network boundaries, and edgeless networks, each of which poses new challenges for the identification of significant forensic artifacts. One example of the positive societal impact of IoT devices is that of Humanoid robots, with applications in public spaces such as assisted living, medical facilities, and airports. These robots use IoT to provide varying functionality but rely heavily on supervised learning to customize their utilization of the IoT to various environments. A humanoid robot can be a rich source of sensitive data about individuals and environments, and this data may assist in digital investigations, delivering additional information during a crime investigation. In this paper, we present our case study on the Zenbo Humanoid Robot, exploring how Zenbo could be a witness to a crime. In our experiments, a forensic examination was conducted on the robot to locate all useful evidence from multiple locations, including root-level directories using logical acquisition.

 The Steam Deck, developed by Valve, combines handheld gaming with desktop functionality, creating unique challenges for digital forensics due to its Linux-based SteamOS and its stripped symbol tables. This research addresses how to conduct reliable memory forensics on the Steam Deck. Employing the ~\ac{LiME} and Volatility 3, we acquire and analyze volatile memory, a process complicated by Steam's stripped symbol table that obscures forensic reconstruction of memory structures. Our approach reconstructs these symbols and adapts forensic tools to the Steam Deck’s architecture. Our results include the successful generation and validation of symbol tables and the patching of profiles to align with system configurations. During gameplay, we observed a significant increase in platform-related and game-related processes, highlighting the system's dynamic operation while gaming. These findings contribute to improving forensic methodologies for similar Linux-based devices, enhancing our capability to extract valuable forensic data from modern gaming consoles.

 In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud computing, containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes have become instrumental in deploying, scaling, and managing applications. However, these containers pose unique challenges for memory forensics due to their ephemeral nature. As memory forensics is a crucial aspect of incident response, our work combats these challenges by acquiring a deeper understanding of the containers, leading to the development of a novel, scalable tool for container memory forensics. Through experimental and computational analyses, our work investigates the forensic capabilities of container checkpoints, which capture a container's state at a specific moment in time. We introduce \textit{ConPoint}, a tool created for the collection of these checkpoints. We focused on three primary research questions: \textit{What is the most forensically sound approach for checkpointing a container's memory and filesystem?}, \textit{How long does the volatile memory evidence reside in memory?}, and \textit{How long does the checkpoint process take on average to complete?} Our proposed approach allowed us to successfully take checkpoints, and recover all intentionally planted artifacts, that is artifacts generated at runtime from the tested container checkpoints. Our experiments determined the average time for checkpointing a container to be 0.537 seconds by acquiring a total of $(n=45)$ checkpoints from containers running different databases. The proposed work demonstrates the pragmatic feasibility of implementing checkpointing as an overarching strategy for container memory forensics and incident response.

 Recognising IoT devices through network fingerprinting contributes to enhancing the security of IoT networks and supporting forensic activities. Machine learning techniques have been extensively utilised in the literature to optimize IoT fingerprinting accuracy. Given the rapid proliferation of new IoT devices, a current challenge in this field is around how to make IoT fingerprinting scalable, which involves efficiently updating the used machine learning model to enable the recognition of new IoT devices. Some approaches have been proposed to achieve scalability, but they all suffer from limitations like large memory requirements to store training data and accuracy decrease for older devices.  
   
  In this paper, we propose ScaNeF-IoT, a novel scalable network fingerprinting approach for IoT devices based on online stream learning and features extracted from fixed-size session payloads. Employing online stream learning allows to update the model without retaining training data. This, alongside relying on fixed-size session payloads, enables scalability without deteriorating recognition accuracy. We implement ScaNeF-IoT by analysing TPC/UDP payloads and utilising the Aggregated Mandrian Forest as the online stream learning algorithm. We provide a preliminary evaluation of ScaNeF-IoT accuracy and how it is affected as the model is updated iteratively to recognise new IoT devices. Furthermore, we compare ScaNeF-IoT accuracy with other IoT fingerprinting approaches, demonstrating that it is comparable to the state of the art and does not worsen as the classifier model is updated, despite not requiring to retain any training data for older IoT devices.

 Full Paper    

 The NTFS file system contains crucial (meta-)information that plays a significant role in forensic analysis. Among these details are the eight file timestamps, which serve as the foundation for constructing a reliable timeline. However, beyond their temporal significance, these timestamps also harbor valuable clues. Specifically, the patterns of file handling by user programs are reflected in these timestamps. By analyzing these "fingerprint" patterns, it becomes possible to identify the applications responsible for creating and editing files. This discovery facilitates event reconstruction in digital forensics investigations.  
   
  In this study, we explore the extent to which timestamp patterns can be harnessed for application fingerprinting. Our approach involves creating classification models based on neural networks and evaluating their performance using established machine learning metrics. The results demonstrate that analyzing user file timestamps allows us to associate and narrow down potential user programs for specific file types and applications. By automating this process, we significantly reduce the analysis phase duration in forensic investigations, providing relief to resource-constrained IT forensic experts. This novel application fingerprinting method enables swift initial assessments of programs involved in cybercrime incidents.

 Swap memory plays a critical role in modern operating systems' memory management. This paper explores the potential for manipulating swap memory to alter memory content at runtime and thereby control the behaviour of the target system. While conventional memory security techniques typically focus on preventing runtime manipulation of memory pages, they often overlook the moment when pages are swapped and later reloaded into memory. Therefore, we investigate the feasibility of manipulating swap memory and describe the necessary steps of extracting involved memory areas as well as techniques to force swapping of relevant processes. We verify this theoretical concept with a prototype implementing a manipulation of memory of a given program.

 Full Paper    

 Linking attacks to the actors responsible is a critical part of threat analysis. Threat attribution, however, is challenging. Attackers try to avoid detection and avert attention to mislead investigations. The trend of attackers using malicious services provided by third parties also makes it difficult to discern between attackers and providers. Besides that, having a security team doing manual-only analysis might overwhelm analysts. As a result, the effective use of any trustworthy information for attribution is paramount, and automating this process is valuable. For this purpose, we propose an approach to perform automated attribution with a source of reliable information currently underutilised, the DNS patterns used by attackers. Our method creates recommendations based on similar patterns observed between a new incident and already attributed attacks and then generates a list of the most similar attacks. We show that our approach can, at ten recommendations, achieve 0.8438 precision and 0.7378 accuracy. We also show that DNS patterns have a short lifespan, allowing their utility even in more recent knowledge bases.

 Full Paper    

 In the rapidly evolving digital healthcare landscape, the imperative for robust, flexible, and scalable data protection solutions has never been more critical. The advent of sophisticated cyber threats, coupled with the increasing complexity of healthcare IT infrastructures, underscores the necessity for advanced security mechanisms that can adapt to a wide range of challenges without compromising the accessibility or integrity of sensitive healthcare data. Within this context, our work introduces the SECANT Privacy Toolkit, a pioneering approach that harnesses the power of Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) to redefine healthcare data security. We present an implementation prototype that not only serves as a baseline for the quantitative evaluation of healthcare data protection but also exemplifies the SECANT Toolkit's capability to enhance interoperability across disparate healthcare systems, strengthen authentication mechanisms, and ensure scalability amidst the growing data demands of modern healthcare networks. This prototype underscores our commitment to addressing the multifaceted security needs of the healthcare sector by providing a solution that is both comprehensive and adaptable to the dynamic landscape of digital health information security.By integrating cutting-edge cryptographic technologies, including Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and Searchable Encryption (SE), with the flexibility and control offered by PRE, the SECANT Privacy Toolkit stands at the forefront of secure and efficient healthcare data management. This integration facilitates not only the secure exchange of data across decentralized networks but also empowers healthcare providers with tools for fine-grained access control and privacy-preserving data searches, thereby addressing key challenges such as data interoperability, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory compliance.Our exploration reveals the toolkit's potential to revolutionize the way healthcare data is protected, shared, and accessed, providing a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform for healthcare providers, patients, and stakeholders. The SECANT Privacy Toolkit not only aligns with current healthcare data security requirements but also anticipates future challenges, ensuring that it remains a vital asset in the ongoing effort to safeguard sensitive healthcare information. This work contributes significantly toward enhancing the security and privacy of healthcare data, offering a robust framework for interoperability, authentication, and scalability that responds to the evolving needs of the healthcare industry. Through the deployment of our prototype and the subsequent evaluation, we aim to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and transformative potential of the SECANT Privacy Toolkit in advancing healthcare data protection.

 Alexandr Silonosov  (Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden), Lawrence Henesey  (Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden)   
 Full Paper    

 The research presented in the paper evaluates practices of Attribute-Based Encryption, leading to a proposed end-to-end encryption strategy for a cloud-based drone management system. Though extensively used for efficiently gathering and sharing video surveilance data, these systems also collect telemetry information with sensitive data.  
   
  This paper presents a study addressing the current state of knowledge, methodologies, and challenges associated with supporting cryptographic agility for End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for telemetry data confidentiality.  
   
  To enhance cryptographic agility performance, a new metric has been introduced for cryptographic library analysis that improves the methodology by considering Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with a conventional key-encapsulation mechanism in OpenSSL. A comprehensive series of experiments are undertaken to simulate cryptographic agility within the proposed system, showcasing the practical applicability of the proposed approach in measuring cryptographic agility performance.

 Full Paper    

 This is a work-in-progress paper on detecting if a text was written by humans or generated by a language model. In our case study, we focused on email messages. For experiments, we used a mixture of publicly available email datasets with our in-house data, containing in total over 10k emails. Then, we generated their "copies" using large language models (LLMs) with specific prompts. We experimented with various classifiers and feature spaces. We achieved encouraging results, with F1-scores of almost 0.98 for email messages in English and over 0.92 for the ones in Polish, using Random Forest as a classifier. We found that the detection model relied strongly on typographic and orthographic imperfections of the analyzed emails and on statistics of sentence lengths. We also observed the inferior results obtained for Polish, highlighting a need for research in this direction.

 Unveiling the Darkness: Analysing Organised Crime on the Wall Street Market Darknet Marketplace using PGP Public Keys   
 Shiying Fan  (Fraunhofer SIT, Germany), Paul Moritz Ranly  (Fraunhofer SIT, Germany), Lukas Graner  (Fraunhofer SIT, Germany), Inna Vogel  (Fraunhofer SIT, Germany), Martin Steinebach  (Fraunhofer SIT, Germany)   
 Full Paper    

 Darknet marketplaces (DNMs) are digital platforms for e-commerce that are primarily used to trade illegal and illicit products. They incorporate technological advantages for privacy protection and contribute to the growth of cybercriminal activities. In the past, researchers have explored methods to investigate multiple identities of vendors covering different DNMs. Leaving aside phenomena such as malicious forgery of identities or Sybil attacks, usernames and their corresponding PGP public keys are used to build brands around users and are considered a trusted method of vendor authentication across DNMs.  
   
  This paper aims to demonstrate a forensic method for linking users on a DNM called the Wall Street Market using shared PGP public keys. We developed a trading reputation system to evaluate the transaction behaviour of each user group sharing PGP keys (i.e., PGP groups). Based on the reputation indicators we introduced, we compared PGP groups with high, medium and low reputation levels. Our research suggests that the observed PGP groups exhibit varying organisational structures in relation to their reputation levels, including a more organised and dense cooperation or a looser form of cooperation. As this paper provides an in-depth understanding of user networks on a DNM associated with PGP keys, it is of particular interest for the detection of organised criminal groups on DNMs.

 An Exploratory Case Study on Data Breach Journalism   
 Jukka Ruohonen  (University of Southern Denmark, Denmark), Kalle Hjerppe  (University of Turku, Finland), Maximilian von Zastrow  (University of Southern Denmark, Denmark)   
 Full Paper    

 This paper explores the novel topic of data breach journalism and data breach news through the case of databreaches.net, a news outlet dedicated to data breaches and related cyber crime. Motivated by the issues in traditional crime news and crime journalism, the case is explored by the means of text mining. According to the results, the outlet has kept a steady publishing pace, mainly focusing on plain and short reporting but with generally high-quality source material for the news articles. Despite these characteristics, the news articles exhibit fairly strong sentiments, which is partially expected due to the presence of emotionally laden crime and the long history of sensationalism in crime news. The news site has also covered the full scope of data breaches, although many of these are fairly traditional, exposing personal identifiers and financial details of the victims. Also hospitals and the healthcare sector stand out. With these results, the paper advances the study of data breaches by considering these from the perspective of media and journalism.

 ParsEval: Evaluation of Parsing Behavior using Real-world Out-in-the-wild X.509 Certificates   
 Stefan Tatschner  (Fraunhofer AISEC; University of Limerick, Germany), Sebastian N. Peters  (Fraunhofer AISEC; Technical University of Munich, Germany), Michael P.

 Full Paper    

 X.509 certificates play a crucial role in establishing secure communication over the internet by enabling authentication and data integrity. Equipped with a rich feature set, the X.509 standard is defined by multiple, comprehensive ISO/IEC documents. Due to its internet-wide usage, there are different implementations in multiple programming languages leading to a large and fragmented ecosystem. This work addresses the research question “Are there user-visible and security-related differences between X.509 certificate parsers?”. Relevant libraries offering APIs for parsing X.509 certificates were investigated and an appropriate test suite was developed. From 34 libraries 6 were chosen for further analysis. The X.509 parsing modules of the chosen libraries were called with 186,576,846 different certificates from a real-world dataset and the observed error codes were investigated. This study reveals an anomaly in wolfSSL’s X.509 parsing module and that there are fundamental differences in the ecosystem. While related studies nowadays mostly focus on fuzzing techniques resulting in artificial certificates, this study confirms that available X.509 parsing modules differ largely and yield different results, even for real-world out-in-the-wild certificates.

 Full Paper    

 The evolution of authentication mechanisms in ensuring secure access to systems has been crucial for mitigating vulnerabilities and enhancing system security. However, despite advancements in two-factor authentication (2FA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), authentication mechanisms remain weak in system security, particularly when individuals accessing critical systems are involved. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel blockchain-based multi-factor dynamic authentication mechanism (BMFA) that integrates honeytoken technology to enhance security. Our proposed mechanism leverages Ethereum blockchain technology and smart contracts to provide a decentralized and robust authentication framework. By incorporating honeytokens into smart contracts, we introduce a dynamic layer of security that continuously adapts to prevent potential attacks. Our evaluation demonstrates that our BMFA mechanism effectively addresses various security challenges, including brute force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and smart contract vulnerabilities, while providing robust protection against unauthorized access. Our findings emphasise the efficacy of the BMFA mechanism in enhancing system security and mitigating evolving threats in authentication processes for next-generation critical industrial control systems.  

 Evaluating Cyber Security Dashboards for Smart Cities and Buildings: Enhancing User Modeling with LLMs   
 Hanning Zhao  (Tampere University, Finland), Bilhanan Silverajan  (Tampere University, Finland)   
 Full Paper    

 Designing effective cybersecurity visualization has become a crucial component of cyber defense strategies in many domains and industrial environments. Human behaviour, modeling and input is a major aspect for designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization is both time-consuming and challenging, and often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart city and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource to the limited availability of human participants. In particular we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed results obtained had strong correlation to human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visualization systems for industrial environments.

 Full Paper    

 Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and secure platform for addressing various challenges in smart cities and cyber-physical systems, including identity management, trust and transparency, and supply chain management. However, blockchains are susceptible to a variety of threats, akin to any other technological system. To assess the resilience and robustness of diverse blockchain technologies, this study evaluates their performance indicators under various attack scenarios. Therefore, this study conducts a thorough examination of multiple well-known blockchain technologies, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, under Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios. Ethereum, introduced as a revolutionary blockchain technology, has entirely transformed the way smart contracts and decentralized applications operate. Additionally, the innovative open source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is intended for businesses and alliances seeking a secure and adaptable platform to develop distributed ledger applications. Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum client with an extractable Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases. Therefore, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric are utilized in this study for performance comparison. This study provides a summary of Ethereum's salient characteristics, architecture, and noteworthy influence on the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Furthermore, it offers an overview of the main characteristics, architecture, and potential uses of Hyperledger Fabric. The blockchain's resilience against DDoS attacks is assessed by examining performance measures such as latency and throughput, which are fundamental metrics crucial for evaluating and enhancing the effectiveness of various systems, including communication protocols, databases, blockchains, and computer networks. The outcomes of these experiments show that Hyperledger Fabric has greater throughput and reduced latency, demonstrating its resistance to DDoS attacks in comparison with Ethereum. Ethereum, being a permissionless blockchain, can introduce challenges such as the potential for network congestion and scalability issues.  

 How to Find out What’s Going on in Encrypted Smart Meter Networks – without Decrypting Anything   
 Oliver Eigner  (St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria), Hubert Schölnast  (St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria), Paul Tavolato  (University of Vienna, Austria)   
 Full Paper    

 Smart meter networks are part of the critical infrastructure and therefore central to IT security consideration. Besides various forms of access control a permanent monitoring of the network traffic is of utmost importance to the detection of malicious activities taking place. Such monitoring must happen in real time and should possibly be implementable everywhere in the network. These requirements do not allow for the decryption of the network traffic. The paper describes a method by which network packets can be assigned to use cases common in smart meter infrastructures without the need for decryption. It is based solely on metadata and reliably can establish the relationship between a network packet and a use case. The information calculated with this method can be used to detect packets that are not pertaining to any of the allowed use cases and hence are highly suspicious. Moreover, the execution of use cases not initiated by the central server become evident, too, and should raise corresponding alerts. The method was implemented as a proof-of-concept and tested in the real-world environment of a medium-sized city.

 The increasing integration of capacitive fingerprint recognition sensors in IoT devices presents new challenges in digital forensics, particularly in the context of advanced fingerprint spoofing. Previous research has highlighted the effectiveness of materials such as latex and silicone in deceiving biometric systems. In this study, we introduce Alginate, a biopolymer derived from brown seaweed, as a novel material with the potential for spoofing IoT-specific capacitive fingerprint sensors. Our research uses Alginate and cutting-edge image recognition techniques to unveil a nuanced IoT vulnerability that raises significant security and privacy concerns. Our proof-of-concept experiments employed authentic fingerprint molds to create Alginate replicas, which exhibited remarkable visual and tactile similarities to real fingerprints. The conductivity and resistivity properties of Alginate, closely resembling human skin, make it a subject of interest in the digital forensics field, especially regarding its ability to spoof IoT device sensors. This study calls upon the digital forensics community to develop advanced anti-spoofing strategies to protect the evolving IoT infrastructure against such sophisticated threats.

 Matthew Reaney  (Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom), Kieran McLaughlin  (Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom), James Grant  (Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom)   
 Full Paper    

 This paper presents an intrusion response system created using deep reinforcement learning, trained within an emulation environment. The emulation environment aims to represent a networked IT-OT system found within an aircraft. The goal of this paper’s experimentation is to explore training to defend against an attack chain in a way that more closely resembles a real network than that of current work. This has been achieved through the novel inclusion of open-source intrusion detection systems which feed default alert information to the response system. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the reinforcement learning agent to converge towards an effective response policy for defending the system against a multi-stage attack while minimizing disruption to do so.

 Modeling Human Error Factors with Security Incidents in Industrial Control Systems: A Bayesian Belief Network Approach   
 Pushparaj Bhosale  (TU Wien, Austria), Wolfgang Kastner  (TU Wien, Austria), Thilo Sauter  (TU Wien, Austria)   
 Full Paper    

 Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are critical in automating and controlling industrial processes. Human errors within ICSs can significantly impact the system's underlying processes and users' safety. Thus, it is essential to understand the factors contributing to human errors and implement targeted interventions. Various factors that influence and mitigate human errors must be explored, including organizational, supervisory, personal, and technical factors. In parallel, the impact of a security incident also needs consideration. The paper presents a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model developed to model these factors comprehensively and demonstrate their impact, especially in the context of security incidents. Probability distributions are employed with practical assumptions to overcome data limitations, emphasizing the model's utility in risk assessment. The model's complexity is addressed using multiple interconnected sub-models, enhancing accuracy and avoiding unnecessary intricacies. Despite challenges in identifying all relevant factors, a sincere effort is made to incorporate diverse research findings. This paper highlights the essential role of BBN models in understanding and mitigating human errors, contributing to the resilience of ICS processes. The use of BBN and probabilistic distributions enables quantitative and probabilistic analysis of the impact of human errors, aiding in developing more robust risk management strategies to improve system resilience in ICSs.

 ID: 3 | Learning Topological Representations with Bidirectional Graph Attention Network for Solving Job Shop Scheduling Problem  
  
 Cong Zhang, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Wen Song, Jing Sun  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Existing learning-based methods for solving job shop scheduling problems (JSSP) usually use off-the-shelf GNN models tailored to undirected graphs and neglect the rich and meaningful topological structures of disjunctive graphs (DGs). This paper proposes the topology-aware bidirectional graph attention network (TBGAT), a novel GNN architecture based on the attention mechanism, to embed the DG for solving JSSP in a local search framework. Specifically, TBGAT embeds the DG from a forward and a backward view, respectively, where the messages are propagated by following the different topologies of the views and aggregated via graph attention. Then, we propose a novel operator based on the message-passing mechanism to calculate the forward and backward topological sorts of the DG, which are the features for characterizing the topological structures and exploited by our model. In addition, we theoretically and experimentally show that TBGAT has linear computational complexity to the number of jobs and machines, respectively, strengthening our method's practical value. Besides, extensive experiments on five synthetic datasets and seven classic benchmarks show that TBGAT achieves new SOTA results by outperforming a wide range of neural methods by a large margin. All the code and data are publicly available online at https://github.com/zcaicaros/TBGAT. 
 ID: 11 | RE-SORT: Removing Spurious Correlation in Multilevel Interaction for CTR Prediction  
  
 Songli Wu, Liang Du, Jia-Qi Yang, Yuai Wang, De-Chuan Zhan, SHUANG ZHAO, Zixun Sun  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in recommendation systems, serving as the ultimate filtering step to sort items for a user. Most recent cutting-edge methods primarily focus on investigating complex implicit and explicit feature interactions; however, these methods neglect the spurious correlation issue caused by confounding factors, thereby diminishing the model's generalization ability. We propose a CTR prediction framework that REmoves Spurious cORrelations in mulTilevel feature interactions, termed RE-SORT, which has two key components. I. A multilevel stacked recurrent (MSR) structure enables the model to efficiently capture diverse nonlinear interactions from feature spaces at different levels. II. A spurious correlation elimination (SCE) module further leverages Laplacian kernel mapping and sample reweighting methods to eliminate the spurious correlations concealed within the multilevel features, allowing the model to focus on the true causal features. Extensive experiments conducted on four challenging CTR datasets, our production dataset, and an online A/B test demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and speed. The utilized codes, models, and dataset will be released at https://github.com/RE-SORT.

  Abstract      
 Adversarial attacks can mislead automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems into predicting an arbitrary target text, thus posing a clear security threat.

To prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step. Then, by leveraging the characteristics observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural networks. Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99\% and 97\%, respectively. To assess the robustness of our method, we show that adaptive adversarial examples that can circumvent DistriBlock are much noisier, which makes them easier to detect through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system's robustness.ics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step.

 ID: 15 | Consistency Regularization for Domain Generalization with Logit Attribution Matching  
  
 Han Gao, Kaican Li, Weiyan Xie, Zhi LIN, Yongxiang Huang, Luning Wang, Caleb Chen Cao, Nevin L. Zhang  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Domain generalization (DG) is about training models that generalize well under domain shift. Previous research on DG has been conducted mostly in single-source or multi-source settings. In this paper, we consider a third lesser-known setting where a training domain is endowed with a collection of pairs of examples that share the same semantic information. Such semantic sharing (SS) pairs can be created via data augmentation and then utilized for consistency regularization (CR). We present a theory showing CR is conducive to DG and propose a novel CR method called Logit Attribution Matching (LAM). We conduct experiments on five DG benchmarks and four pretrained models with SS pairs created by both generic and targeted data augmentation methods. LAM outperforms representative single/multi-source DG methods and various CR methods that leverage SS pairs. The code and data of this project are available at https://github.com/Gaohan123/LAM. 
 ID: 19 | Decentralized Online Learning in General-Sum Stackelberg Games  
  
 Yaolong Yu, Haipeng Chen  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We study an online learning problem in general-sum Stackelberg games, where players act in a decentralized and strategic manner. We study two settings depending on the type of information for the follower: (1) the $\textit{limited information}$ setting where the follower only observes its own reward, and (2) the $\textit{side information}$ setting where the follower has extra side information about the leader's reward. We show that for the follower, myopically best responding to the leader's action is the best strategy for the limited information setting, but not necessarily so for the side information setting -- the follower can manipulate the leader's reward signals with strategic actions, and hence induce the leader's strategy to converge to an equilibrium that is better off for itself. Based on these insights, we study decentralized online learning for both players in the two settings. Our main contribution is to derive $\textit{last iterate}$ convergence and sample complexity results in both settings. Notably, we design a new manipulation strategy for the follower in the latter setting, and show that it has an intrinsic advantage against the best response strategy. Our theories are also supported by empirical results. 
 ID: 25 | Graph Feedback Bandits with Similar Arms  
 [spotlight]  
 Han Qi, Fei Guo, Li Zhu  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In this paper, we study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with graph feedback. Motivated by the clinical trials and recommendation problem, we assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are similar (i.e., their means are close enough). We establish a regret lower bound for this novel feedback structure and introduce two UCB-based algorithms: D-UCB with problem-independent regret upper bounds and C-UCB with problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also consider the scenario where the number of arms increases over time. Practical applications related to this scenario include Q\&A platforms (Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews in Amazon and Flipkart. Answers (product reviews) continually appear on the website, and the goal is to display the best answers (product reviews) at the top. When the means of arms are independently generated from some distribution, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss the sub-linearity of bounds in relation to the distribution of means. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results. 
 ID: 26 | Low-rank Matrix Bandits with Heavy-tailed Rewards  
  
 Yue Kang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Thomas Lee  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In stochastic low-rank matrix bandit, the expected reward of an arm is equal to the inner product between its feature matrix and some unknown $d_1$ by $d_2$ low-rank parameter matrix $\Theta^*$ with rank $r \ll d_1\wedge d_2$. While all prior studies assume the payoffs are mixed with sub-Gaussian noises, in this work we loosen this strict assumption and consider the new problem of low-rank matrix bandit with heavy-tailed rewards (LowHTR), where the rewards only have finite $(1+\delta)$ moment for some $\delta \in (0,1]$. By utilizing the truncation on observed payoffs and the dynamic exploration, we propose a novel algorithm called LOTUS attaining the regret bound of order $\tilde O(d^\frac{3}{2}r^\frac{1}{2}T^\frac{1}{1+\delta}/\tilde{D}_{rr})$ without knowing $T$, which matches the state-of-the-art regret bound under sub-Gaussian noises~\citep{lu2021low,kang2022efficient} with $\delta = 1$. Moreover, we establish a lower bound of the order $\Omega(d^\frac{\delta}{1+\delta} r^\frac{\delta}{1+\delta} T^\frac{1}{1+\delta}) = \Omega(T^\frac{1}{1+\delta})$ for LowHTR, which indicates our LOTUS is nearly optimal in the order of $T$. In addition, we improve LOTUS so that it does not require knowledge of the rank $r$ with $\tilde O(dr^\frac{3}{2}T^\frac{1+\delta}{1+2\delta})$ regret bound, and it is efficient under the high-dimensional scenario. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate the practical superiority of our algorithm. 
 ID: 37 | Trusted re-weighting for label distribution learning  
  
 Zhuoran Zheng, Chen Wu, YEYING JIN, Xiuyi Jia  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Label distribution learning (LDL) is a novel machine learning paradigm that aims to shift 0/1 labels into descriptive degrees to characterize the polysemy of instances. Since the description degree takes a value between 0 ∼ 1, it is difficult for the annotator to accurately annotate each label. Therefore, the predictive ability of numerous LDL algorithms may be degraded by the presence of noise in the label space. To address this problem, we propose a novel stability-trust LDL framework that aims to reconstruct the feature space of an arbitrary LDL dataset by using feature decoupling and prototype guidance. Specifically, first, we use prototype learning to select reliable cluster centers (representative vectors of label distributions) to filter out a set of clean samples (with labeled noise) on the original dataset. Then, we decouple the feature space (eliminating correlations among features) by modeling a weight assigner that is learned on this clean sample set, thus assigning weights to each sample of the original dataset. Finally, all existing LDL algorithms can be trained on this new re-weighted dataset for the goal of robust modeling. In addition, we create a new image dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework boosts the performance of the LDL algorithm on datasets with label noise. 
 ID: 40 | Partial Identification with Proxy of Latent Confoundings via Sum-of-ratios Fractional Programming  
  
 Zhiheng Zhang, Xinyan Su  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Causal effect estimation is a crucial theoretical tool in uncertainty analysis. The challenge of unobservable confoundings has raised concerns regarding quantitative causality computation. To address this issue, proxy control has become popular, employing auxiliary variables W as proxies for the confounding variables U. However, proximal methods rely on strong assumptions, such as reversibility and completeness, that are challenging to interpret empirically and verify. Consequently, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited, particularly when the proxies lack informativeness. In our paper, we have developed a novel optimization method named Partial Identification with Proxy of Latent Confoundings via Sum-of-Ratios Fractional Programming (PI-SFP). This method does not impose any additional restrictions upon proxies and only assumes the mild partial observability of the transition matrix P(W | U). We have theoretically proven the global convergence of PI-SFP to the valid bound of the causal effect and analyzed the conditions under which the bounds could be tight. Our synthetic and real-world experiments validate our theoretical framework. 
 ID: 41 | SMuCo: Reinforcement Learning for Visual Control via Sequential Multi-view Total Correlation  
  
 Tong Cheng, Hang Dong, Lu Wang, Bo Qiao, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Thomas Moscibroda  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The advent of abundant image data has catalyzed the advancement of visual control in reinforcement learning (RL) systems, leveraging multiple view- points to capture the same physical states, which could enhance control performance theoretically. However, integrating multi-view data into representation learning remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SMuCo, an innovative multi-view reinforcement learning algorithm that constructs robust latent representations by optimizing multi- view sequential total correlation. This technique effectively captures task-relevant information and temporal dynamics while filtering out irrelevant data. Our method supports an unlimited number of views and demonstrates superior performance over leading model-free and model-based RL algorithms. Empirical results from the DeepMind Control Suite and the Sapien Basic Manipulation Task confirm SMuCo’s enhanced efficacy, significantly improving task performance across diverse scenarios and views. 
 ID: 42 | Inference in Probabilistic Answer Set Programs with Imprecise Probabilities via Optimization  
 [oral]  
 Damiano Azzolini, Fabrizio Riguzzi  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Probabilistic answer set programming has recently been extended to manage imprecise probabilities by means of credal probabilistic facts and credal annotated disjunctions. This increases the expressivity of the language but, at the same time, the cost of inference. In this paper, we cast inference in probabilistic answer set programs with credal probabilistic facts and credal annotated disjunctions as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem where the function to optimize is obtained via knowledge compilation. Empirical results on different datasets with multiple configurations shows the effectiveness of our approach. 
 ID: 43 | Fast Reliability Estimation for Neural Networks with Adversarial Attack-Driven Importance Sampling  
  
 Karim TIT, Teddy Furon  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the reliability of Neural Networks (NNs) by integrating adversarial attacks with Importance Sampling (IS), enhancing the assessment's precision and efficiency. Leveraging adversarial attacks to guide IS, our method efficiently identifies vulnerable input regions, offering a more directed alternative to traditional Monte Carlo methods. While comparing our approach with classical reliability techniques like FORM and SORM, and with classical rare event simulation methods such as Cross-Entropy IS, we acknowledge its reliance on the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and its inability to handle very high-dimensional data such as ImageNet. Despite these challenges, our comprehensive empirical validations on the datasets the MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate the method's capability to accurately estimate NN reliability for a variety of models. Our research not only presents an innovative strategy for reliability assessment in NNs but also sets the stage for further work exploiting the connection between adversarial robustness and the field of statistical reliability engineering. 
 ID: 44 | Learning from Crowds with Dual-View K-Nearest Neighbor  
  
 Jiao Li, Liangxiao Jiang, Xue Wu, Wenjun Zhang  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In crowdsourcing scenarios, we can obtain multiple noisy labels from different crowd workers for each instance and then infer its integrated label via label integration. To achieve better performance, some recently published label integration methods have attempted to exploit the multiple noisy labels of inferred instances’ nearest neighbors via the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. However, the used KNN algorithm searches inferred instances’ nearest neighbors only relying on the defined distance functions in the original attribute view and totally ignoring the valuable information hidden in the multiple noisy labels, which limits their performance. Motivated by multi-view learning, we define the multiple noisy labels as another label view of instances and propose to search inferred instances’ nearest neighbors using the joint information from both the original attribute view and the multiple noisy label view. To this end, we propose a novel label integration method called dual-view K-nearest neighbor (DVKNN). In DVKNN, we first define a new distance function to search the K-nearest neighbors of an inferred instance. Then, we define a fine-grained weight for each noisy label from each neighbor. Finally, we perform weighted majority voting (WMV) on all these noisy labels to obtain the integrated label of the inferred instance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and rationality of DVKNN. 
 ID: 59 | BanditQ:Fair Bandits with Guaranteed Rewards  
  
 Abhishek Sinha  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Classic no-regret multi-armed bandit algorithms, including the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Hedge, and EXP3, are inherently unfair by design. Their unfairness stems from their objective of playing the most rewarding arm as frequently as possible while ignoring the rest. In this paper, we consider a fair prediction problem in the stochastic setting with a guaranteed minimum rate of accrual of rewards for each arm. We study the problem in both full-information and bandit feedback settings. Combining queueing-theoretic techniques with adversarial bandits, we propose a new online policy called BanditQ that achieves the target reward rates while conceding a regret and target rate violation penalty of at most $O(T^{\frac{3}{4}}).$ The regret bound in the full-information setting can be further improved to $O(\sqrt{T})$ under either a monotonicity assumption or when considering time-averaged regret. The proposed policy is efficient and admits a black-box reduction from the fair prediction problem to the standard adversarial MAB problem. The analysis of the BanditQ policy involves a new self-bounding inequality, which might be of independent interest. 
 ID: 65 | Efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search via On-the-Fly State-Conditioned Action Abstraction  
 [oral]  
 Yunhyeok Kwak, Inwoo Hwang, Dooyoung Kim, Sanghack Lee, Byoung-Tak Zhang  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has showcased its efficacy across a broad spectrum of decision-making problems. However, its performance often degrades under vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state, which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model. During the tree traversal, our method constructs the state-conditioned action abstraction for each node on-the-fly, reducing the search space by discarding the exploration of redundant sub-actions. Experimental results demonstrate the superior sample efficiency of our method compared to vanilla MuZero, which suffers from expansive action space. 
 ID: 76 | Towards Minimax Optimality of Model-based Robust Reinforcement Learning  
 [oral]  
 Pierre Clavier, Erwan Le Pennec, Matthieu Geist  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We study the sample complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in \emph{Robust} discounted Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs), given only access to a generative model of the nominal kernel. This problem is widely studied in the non-robust case, and it is known that any planning approach applied to an empirical MDP estimated with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^3 |S||A|}{\epsilon^2})$ samples provides an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, which is minimax optimal. Results in the robust case are much more scarce. For $sa$- (resp $s$-) rectangular uncertainty sets, until recently the best-known sample complexity was $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^4 |S|^2|A|}{\epsilon^2})$ (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^4 | S |^2| A |^2}{\epsilon^2})$), for specific algorithms and when the uncertainty set is based on the total variation (TV), the KL or the Chi-square divergences. In this paper, we consider uncertainty sets defined with an $L_p$-ball (recovering the TV case), and study the sample complexity of \emph{any} planning algorithm (with high accuracy guarantee on the solution) applied to an empirical RMDP estimated using the generative model. In the general case, we prove a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^4 | S || A |}{\epsilon^2})$ for both the $sa$- and $s$-rectangular cases (improvements of $| S |$ and $| S || A |$ respectively). When the size of the uncertainty is small enough, we improve the sample complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^3 | S || A | }{\epsilon^2})$, recovering the lower-bound for the non-robust case for the first time and a robust lower-bound. Finally, we also introduce simple and efficient algorithms for solving the studied $L_p$ robust MDPs. 
 ID: 79 | Neighbor Similarity and Multimodal Alignment based Product Recommendation Study

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Existing multimodal recommendation research still faces some challenges, such as not being able to fully mine the implicit relevance information of neighbor nodes, and the unreasonable weight allocation to imbalanced nodes. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces a new multimodal recommendation model called NSMAR+. Specifically, the model firstly constructs a neighbor similarity graph convolutional network to capture the implicit relevance information and reasonably assigns the attention weights through the graph attention mechanism. Secondly, the model introduces a modal alignment and fusion mechanism by using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map image and text features into a shared space for comparison and fusion. In addition, the model constructs a user co-interaction graph and an item semantic graph based on the original information and performs graph convolution operations to enhance the preference information of users and items, and to better capture the interactions and internal features between users and items. Finally, MLP is employed to aggregate user and item representations and predict personalized recommendation rankings. To validate the experiment’s efficacy, this paper compares with several leading multimodal recommendation models on public datasets with a performance improvement of 1% to 3%. The experimental outcomes indicate that the model in this paper has good superiority and accuracy in multimodal recommendation tasks. 
 ID: 86 | Differentiable Pareto-Smoothed Weighting for High-Dimensional Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation  
  
 Yoichi Chikahara, Kansei Ushiyama  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 There is a growing interest in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects across individuals using their high-dimensional feature attributes. Achieving high performance in such high-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is challenging because in this setup, it is usual that some features induce sample selection bias while others do not but are predictive of potential outcomes. To avoid losing such predictive feature information, existing methods learn separate feature representations using inverse probability weighting (IPW). However, due to their numerically unstable IPW weights, these methods suffer from estimation bias under a finite sample setup. To develop a numerically robust estimator by weighted representation learning, we propose a differentiable Pareto-smoothed weighting framework that replaces extreme weight values in an end-to-end fashion. Our experimental results show that by effectively correcting the weight values, our proposed method outperforms the existing ones, including traditional weighting schemes.

 ID: 90 | Calibrated and Conformal Propensity Scores for Causal Effect Estimation  
  
 Shachi Deshpande, Volodymyr Kuleshov  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Propensity scores are commonly used to balance observed covariates while estimating treatment effects. We argue that the probabilistic output of a learned propensity score model should be calibrated, i.e. a predictive treatment probability of 90% should correspond to 90% of individuals being assigned the treatment group. We propose simple recalibration techniques to ensure this property. We prove that calibration is a necessary condition for unbiased treatment effect estimation when using popular inverse propensity weighted and doubly robust estimators. We derive error bounds on causal effect estimates that directly relate to the quality of uncertainties provided by the probabilistic propensity score model and show that calibration strictly improves this error bound while also avoiding extreme propensity weights. We demonstrate improved causal effect estimation with calibrated propensity scores in several tasks including high-dimensional image covariates and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Calibrated propensity scores improve the speed of GWAS analysis by more than two-fold by enabling the use of simpler models that are faster to train.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Hybrid action control tasks are common in the real world, which require controlling some discrete and continuous actions simultaneously. To solve these tasks, existing Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) methods either directly build a separate policy for each type of action or simplify the hybrid action space into a discrete or continuous action control problem. However, these methods neglect the challenge of exploration resulting from the complexity of the hybrid action space. Thus, it is necessary to design more sample efficient algorithms. To this end, we propose a novel Hybrid Control Transformer (Hybrid CtrlFormer), to achieve better exploration and exploitation for the hybrid action control problems. The core idea is: 1) we construct a hybrid action space tree with the discrete actions at the higher level and the continuous parameter space at the lower level. Each parameter space is split into multiple subregions. 2) To simplify the exploration space, a Transformer-based Monte-Carlo tree search method is designed to efficiently evaluate and partition the hybrid action space into good and bad subregions along the tree. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and sample efficiency in a variety of environments with discrete-continuous action space.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Reinforcement learning (RL) has exceeded human performance in many synthetic settings such as video games and Go. However, real-world deployment of end-to-end RL models is less common, as RL models can be very sensitive to perturbations in the environment. The robust Markov decision process (MDP) framework---in which the transition probabilities belong to an uncertainty set around a nominal model---provides one way to develop robust models. While previous analysis for robust MDP shows RL algorithms are effective assuming access to a generative model, it remains unclear whether RL can be efficient under a more realistic online setting, which requires a careful balance between exploration and exploitation. In this work, we consider online robust MDP by interacting with an unknown nominal system. We propose a robust optimistic policy optimization algorithm that is provably efficient. To address the additional uncertainty caused by an adversarial environment, our model features a new optimistic update rule derived via Fenchel conjugates. Our analysis establishes the first regret bound for online robust MDPs.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Normalizing flow-based generative models have been widely used in applications where the exact density estimation is of major importance. Recent research proposes numerous methods to improve their expressivity. However, conditioning on a context is largely overlooked area in the bijective flow research. Conventional conditioning with the vector concatenation is limited to only a few flow types. More importantly, this approach cannot support a practical setup where a set of context-conditioned (*specialist*) models are trained with the fixed pretrained general-knowledge (*generalist*) model. We propose ContextFlow++ approach to overcome these limitations using an additive conditioning with explicit generalist-specialist knowledge decoupling. Furthermore, we support discrete contexts by the proposed mixed-variable architecture with context encoders. Particularly, our context encoder for discrete variables is a surjective flow from which the context-conditioned continuous variables are sampled. Our experiments on rotated MNIST-R, corrupted CIFAR-10C, real-world ATM predictive maintenance and SMAP unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks show that the proposed ContextFlow++ offers faster stable training and achieves higher performance metrics. Our code is publicly available at [github.com/gudovskiy/contextflow](https://github.com/gudovskiy/contextflow). 
 ID: 101 | Inference for Optimal Linear Treatment Regimes in Personalized Decision-making  
 [oral]  
 Yuwen Cheng, Shu Yang  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Personalized decision-making, tailored to individual characteristics, is gaining significant attention. The optimal treatment regime aims to provide the best-expected outcome in the entire population, known as the value function. One approach to determine this optimal regime is by maximizing the Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) estimator of the value function. However, the derived treatment regime can be intricate and nonlinear, limiting their use. For clarity and interoperability, we emphasize linear regimes and determine the optimal linear regime by optimizing the AIPW estimator within set constraints. While the AIPW estimator offers a viable path to estimating the optimal regime, current methodologies predominantly focus on its asymptotic distribution, leaving a gap in studying the linear regime itself. However, there are many benefits to understanding the regime, as pinpointing significant covariates can enhance treatment effects and provide future clinical guidance. In this paper, we explore the asymptotic distribution of the estimated linear regime. Our results show that the parameter associated with the linear regime follows a cube-root convergence to a non-normal limiting distribution characterized by the maximizer of a centered Gaussian process with a quadratic drift. When making inferences for the estimated linear regimes with cube-root convergence in practical scenarios, the standard nonparametric bootstrap is invalid. As a solution, we facilitate the Cattaneo et al. (2020) bootstrap technique to provide a consistent distributional approximation for the estimated linear regimes, validated further through simulations and real-world data applications from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. 
 ID: 103 | Two Facets of SDE Under an Information-Theoretic Lens: Generalization of SGD via Training Trajectories and via Terminal States  
  
 Ziqiao Wang, Yongyi Mao  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been shown recently to characterize well the dynamics of training machine learning models with SGD. When the generalization error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization bound using the information-theoretic bound from Xu and Raginsky [2017]. Secondly, assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE and use information-theoretic bounds from Xu and Raginsky [2017] and Negrea et al. [2019] to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. Our proposed bounds have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in Wang and Mao [2022], and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate comparable to stability-based bounds. 
 ID: 108 | Towards Bounding Causal Effects under Markov Equivalence  
 [oral]  
 Alexis Bellot  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Predicting the effect of unseen interventions is a fundamental research question across the data sciences. It is well established that in general such questions cannot be answered definitively from observational data. This realization has fuelled a growing literature introducing various identifying assumptions, for example in the form of a causal diagram among relevant variables. In practice, this paradigm is still too rigid for many practical applications as it is generally not possible to confidently delineate the true causal diagram. In this paper, we consider the derivation of bounds on causal effects given only observational data. We propose to take as input a less informative structure known as a Partial Ancestral Graph, which represents a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams and is learnable from data. In this more ``data-driven'' setting, we provide a systematic algorithm to derive bounds on causal effects that exploit the invariant properties of the equivalence class, and that can be computed analytically. We demonstrate our method with synthetic and real data examples. 
 ID: 112 | Guaranteeing Robustness Against Real-World Perturbations In Time Series Classification Using Conformalized Randomized Smoothing  
  
 Nicola Franco, Jakob Spiegelberg, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz, Stephan Günnemann  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Certifying the robustness of machine learning models against domain shifts and input space perturbations is crucial for many applications, where high risk decisions are based on the model's predictions. Techniques such as randomized smoothing have partially addressed this issues with a focus on adversarial attacks in the past. In this paper, we generalize randomized smoothing to arbitrary transformations and extend it to conformal prediction. The proposed ansatz is demonstrated on a time series classifier connected to an automotive use case. We meticulously assess the robustness of smooth classifiers in environments subjected to various degrees and types of time series native perturbations and compare it against standard conformal predictors. The proposed method consistently offers superior resistance to perturbations, maintaining high classification accuracy and reliability. Additionally, we are able to bound the performance on new domains via calibrating generalization with configuration shifts in the training data. In combination, conformalized randomized smoothing may offer a model agnostic approach to construct robust classifiers tailored to perturbations in their respective applications - a crucial capability for AI assurance argumentation. 
 ID: 113 | Can we Defend Against the Unknown? An Empirical Study About Threshold Selection for Neural Network Monitoring  
  
 Khoi Tran DANG, Kevin Delmas, Jeremie Guiochet, Joris Guerin  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 With the increasing use of neural networks in critical systems, runtime monitoring becomes essential to reject unsafe predictions during inference. Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.

 Andrew Gracyk, Xiaohui Chen  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Optimal transport (OT) offers a versatile framework to compare complex data distributions in a geometrically meaningful way. Traditional methods for computing the Wasserstein distance and geodesic between probability measures require mesh-specific domain discretization and suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. We present GeONet, a mesh-invariant deep neural operator network that learns the non-linear mapping from the input pair of initial and terminal distributions to the Wasserstein geodesic connecting the two endpoint distributions. In the offline training stage, GeONet learns the saddle point optimality conditions for the dynamic formulation of the OT problem in the primal and dual spaces that are characterized by a coupled PDE system. The subsequent inference stage is instantaneous and can be deployed for real-time predictions in the online learning setting. We demonstrate that GeONet achieves comparable testing accuracy to the standard OT solvers on simulation examples and the MNIST dataset with considerably reduced inference-stage computational cost by orders of magnitude.

 Zhi Wang, Geelon So, Ramya Korlakai Vinayak  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We study metric learning from preference comparisons under the ideal point model, in which a user prefers an item over another if it is closer to their latent ideal item. These items are embedded into $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with an unknown Mahalanobis distance shared across users. While recent work shows that it is possible to simultaneously recover the metric and ideal items given $\mathcal{O}(d)$ pairwise comparisons per user, in practice we often have a limited budget of $o(d)$ comparisons. We study whether the metric can still be recovered, even though learning individual ideal items is now no longer possible. We show that, on the one hand, $o(d)$ comparisons may not reveal any information about the metric, even with infinitely many users. On the other hand, when comparisons are made over items that exhibit low-dimensional structure, each user can contribute to learning the metric restricted to a low-dimensional subspace so that the metric can be jointly identified. We present a divide-and-conquer approach that achieves this, and provide theoretical recovery guarantees and empirical validation.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Bayesian methods provide an elegant framework for estimating parameter posteriors and quantification of uncertainty associated with probabilistic models. However, they often suffer from slow inference times. To address this challenge, Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) have emerged as a promising solution. BPC methods aim to create a small synthetic dataset, known as pseudo-coresets, that approximates the posterior inference achieved with the original dataset. This approximation is achieved by optimizing a divergence measure between the true posterior and the pseudo-coreset posterior. Various divergence measures have been proposed for constructing pseudo-coresets, with forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence being the most successful. However, using forward KL divergence necessitates sampling from the pseudo-coreset posterior, often accomplished through approximate Gaussian variational distributions. Alternatively, one could employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling, but this becomes challenging in high-dimensional parameter spaces due to slow mixing. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for constructing pseudo-coresets by utilizing contrastive divergence. Importantly, optimizing contrastive divergence eliminates the need for approximations in the pseudo-coreset construction process. Furthermore, it enables the use of finite-step MCMC methods, alleviating the requirement for extensive mixing to reach a stationary distribution. To validate our method's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing BPC techniques. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/backpropagator/BPC-CD .

  Abstract      
 Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Quantification of Uncertainty in predictions is a challenging problem. In the classification settings, although deep learning based models generalize well, class probabilities often lack reliability. Calibration errors are used to quantify uncertainty, and several methods exist to minimize calibration error. We argue that between the choice of having a minimum calibration error on original distribution which increases across distortions or having a (possibly slightly higher) calibration error which is constant across distortions, we prefer the latter We hypothesize that the reason for unreliability of deep networks is - The way neural networks are currently trained, the probabilities do not generalize across small distortions. We observe that quantile based approaches can potentially solve this problem. We propose an innovative approach to decouple the construction of quantile representations from the loss function allowing us to compute quantile based probabilities without disturbing the original network. We achieve this by establishing a novel duality property between quantiles and probabilities, and an ability to obtain quantile probabilities from any pre-trained classifier. While post-hoc calibration techniques successfully minimize calibration errors, they do not preserve robustness to distortions. We show that, Quantile probabilities (QuantProb), obtained from Quantile representations, preserve the calibration errors across distortions, since quantile probabilities generalize better than the naive Softmax probabilities.

 Louis BETZER, Vorapong Suppakitpaisarn, Quentin Hillebrand  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In our study, we present an algorithm for publishing the count of walks and Katz centrality under local differential privacy (LDP), complemented by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. While previous research in LDP has predominantly focused on counting subgraphs with a maximum of five nodes, our work extends this to larger subgraphs. The primary challenge in such an extension lies in managing the exponentially increasing noise associated with LDP as the size of the subgraph grows. Our solution involves an algorithm for publishing the count of walks originating from each node in the graph, which subsequently enables us to publish the Katz centrality of all nodes. This algorithm incorporates multiple communication rounds and employs a clipping technique. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves has a relatively small bias and variance, showing significant improvements over both the randomized response method and non-clipping algorithms. Additionally, our approach to estimating Katz centrality successfully identifies up to 90\% of the nodes with the highest centrality values. 
 ID: 144 | On the Convergence of Hierarchical Federated Learning with Partial Worker Participation  
  
 Xiaohan Jiang, Hongbin Zhu  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as the architecture of choice for multi-level communication networks, mainly because of its data privacy protection and low communication cost. However, existing studies on the convergence analysis for HFL are limited to the assumptions of full worker participation and/or i.i.d. datasets across workers, both of which rarely hold in practice. Motivated by this, we in this work propose a unified convergence analysis framework for HFL covering both full and partial worker participation with non-i.i.d. data, non-convex objective function and stochastic gradient. We correspondingly develop a three-sided learning rates algorithm to mitigate data divergences issue, thereby realizing better convergence performance. Our theoretical results provide key insights of why partial participation of HFL is beneficial in significantly reducing the data divergences compared to standard FL. Besides, the convergence analysis allows certain individualization for each cluster in HFL indicating that adjusting the worker sampling ratio and round period can improve the convergence behavior. 
 ID: 145 | Optimistic Regret Bounds for Online Learning in Adversarial Markov Decision Processes  
 [oral]  
 Sang Bin Moon, Abolfazl Hashemi  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The Adversarial Markov Decision Process (AMDP) is a learning framework that deals with unknown and varying tasks in decision-making applications like robotics and recommendation systems. A major limitation of the AMDP formalism, however, is pessimistic regret analysis results in the sense that although the cost function can change from one episode to the next, the evolution in many settings is not adversarial. To address this, we introduce and study a new variant of AMDP, which aims to minimize regret while utilizing a set of cost predictors. For this setting, we develop a new policy search method that achieves a sublinear optimistic regret with high probability, that is a regret bound which gracefully degrades with the estimation power of the cost predictors. Establishing such optimistic regret bounds is nontrivial given that (i) as we demonstrate, the existing importance-weighted cost estimators cannot establish optimistic bounds, and (ii) the feedback model of AMDP is different (and more realistic) than the existing optimistic online learning works. Our result, in particular, hinges upon developing a novel optimistically biased cost estimator that leverages cost predictors and enables a high-probability regret analysis without imposing restrictive assumptions. We further discuss practical extensions of the proposed scheme and demonstrate its efficacy numerically.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Bayesian optimization (BO) is a well-established methodology for optimizing costly black-box functions. However, the sparse observations in the high-dimensional search space pose challenges in constructing reliable Gaussian Process (GP) models, which leads to blind exploration of the search space. We propose a novel Voronoi Graph Traversing (VGT) algorithm to extend BO to ultra high-dimensional problems. VGT employs a Voronoi diagram to mesh the design space and transform it into an undirected Voronoi graph. VGT explores the search space by iteratively performing path selection, promising cell sampling, and graph expansion operations. We introduce a UCB-based global traversal strategy to select the path towards promising Voronoi cells. Then we perform local BO within the promising cell and train local GP with a neighboring subset. The intrinsic geometric boundaries and adjacency of the Voronoi graph assist in fine-tuning the trajectory of local BO sampling. We also present a subspace enhancement approach for the intrinsic low-dimensional problems. Experimental results, including both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, demonstrate the proposed approach's state-of-the-art performance for tackling ultra high-dimensional problems ranging from hundreds to one thousand dimensions.

  Abstract      
 By relaxing conditions for “natural” structure learning algorithms, a family of constraint-based algorithms containing all exact structure learning algorithms under the faithfulness assumption, we define localised natural structure learning algorithms (LoNS). We also provide a set of necessary and sufficient assumptions for consistency of LoNS, which can be thought of as a strict relaxation of the restricted faithfulness assumption. We provide a practical LoNS algorithm that runs in exponential time, which is then compared with related existing structure learning algorithms, namely PC/SGS and the relatively recent Sparsest Permutation algorithm. Simulation studies are also provided.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) facilitate adaptive inference by producing predictions at multiple stages of the forward pass. In safety-critical applications, these predictions are only meaningful when complemented with reliable uncertainty estimates. Yet, due to their sequential structure, an EENN's uncertainty estimates should also be *consistent*: labels that are deemed improbable at one exit should not reappear within the confidence interval / set of later exits. We show that standard uncertainty quantification techniques, like Bayesian methods or conformal prediction, can lead to inconsistency across exits. We address this problem by applying anytime-valid confidence sequences (AVCSs) to the exits of EENNs. By design, AVCSs maintain consistency across exits. We examine the theoretical and practical challenges of applying AVCSs to EENNs and empirically validate our approach on both regression and classification tasks.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Object detectors in real-world applications often fail to detect objects due to varying factors such as weather conditions and noisy input. Therefore, a process that mitigates false detections is crucial for both safety and accuracy. While uncertainty-based thresholding shows promise, previous works demonstrate an imperfect correlation between uncertainty and detection errors. This hinders ideal thresholding, prompting us to further investigate the correlation and associated cost with different types of uncertainty. We therefore propose a cost-sensitive framework for object detection tailored to user-defined budgets on the two types of errors, missing and false detections. We derive minimum thresholding requirements to prevent performance degradation and define metrics to assess the applicability of uncertainty for failure recognition. Furthermore, we automate and optimize the thresholding process to maximize the failure recognition rate w.r.t. the specified budget. Evaluation on three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances safety, particularly in challenging scenarios. Leveraging localization aleatoric uncertainty and softmax-based entropy only, our method boosts the failure recognition rate by 36-60\% compared to conventional approaches.

  Abstract      
 The practical use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in engineering applications imposes special requirements: high sampling efficiency on the one hand and finding a robust solution on the other hand. We address the case of adversarial robustness, where all parameters are controllable during the optimization process, but a subset of them is uncontrollable or even adversely perturbed at the time of application. To this end, we develop an efficient information-based acquisition function that we call Robust Entropy Search (RES). We empirically demonstrate its benefits in experiments on synthetic and real-life data. The results show that RES reliably finds robust optima, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.

 Jing Wang, Yunfei Teng, Anna Ewa Choromanska  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Modern deep learning (DL) architectures are trained using variants of the SGD algorithm and typically rely on the user to manually drop the learning rate when the training curve saturates. In this paper, we develop an algorithm, that we call AutoDrop, that realizes the learning rate drop automatically and stems from the properties of the learning dynamics of DL systems. Specifically, it is motivated by the observation that the angular velocity of the model parameters, i.e., the velocity of the changes of the convergence direction, for a fixed learning rate initially increases rapidly and then progresses towards soft saturation. At saturation, the optimizer slows down thus the angular velocity saturation is a good indicator for dropping the learning rate. After the drop, the angular velocity “resets” and follows the pattern described above, increasing again until saturation. AutoDrop is built on this idea and drops the learning rate whenever the angular velocity saturates. The method is simple to implement, computationally cheap, and by design avoids the short-horizon bias problem. We show that AutoDrop achieves favorable performance compared to many different baseline manual and automatic learning rate schedulers, and matches the SOTA performance on all our experiments. On the theoretical front, we claim two contributions: we formulate the learning rate behavior based on the angular velocity and provide general convergence theory for the learning rate schedulers that decrease the learning rate step-wise, rather than continuously as is commonly analyzed.

 [oral]

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 This paper investigates the Mechanism Design aspects of the $m$-Capacitated Facility Location Problem where the total facility capacity is lower than the number of agents. Following \cite{aziz2020capacity}, the Social Welfare of the facility location is determined through a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) game where agents compete after the facility positions are established. When the number of facilities is $m>1$, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the FCFS game is not unique, thus the utility of the agents and the notion of truthfulness are not well-defined. To address these issues, we consider absolutely truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms able to prevent agents from misreporting regardless of the strategies played during the FCFS game. We pair this more stringent truthfulness requirement with the notion of Equilibrium Stable (ES) mechanism, i.e. mechanisms whose Social Welfare does not depend on the NE of the FCFS game. We show that the class of percentile mechanisms is absolutely truthful and characterize under which conditions they are ES. We then show that the approximation ratio of each ES percentile mechanism is bounded and determine its value. Notably, when all the facilities have the same capacity and the number of agents is large enough, it is possible to achieve an approximation ratio smaller than $1+\frac{1}{2m-1}$. We enhance our findings by empirically evaluating the mechanisms' performances when agents' true positions follows a distribution.

  Abstract      
 This paper addresses the problem of selective classification for deep neural networks, where a model is allowed to abstain from low-confidence predictions to avoid potential errors. We focus on so-called post-hoc methods, which replace the confidence estimator of a given classifier without modifying or retraining it, thus being practically appealing. Considering neural networks with softmax outputs, our goal is to identify the best confidence estimator that can be computed directly from the unnormalized logits. This problem is motivated by the intriguing observation in recent work that many classifiers appear to have a ``broken'' confidence estimator, in the sense that their selective classification performance is much worse than what could be expected by their corresponding accuracies. We perform an extensive experimental study of many existing and proposed confidence estimators applied to 84 pretrained ImageNet classifiers available from popular repositories. Our results show that a simple $p$-norm normalization of the logits, followed by taking the maximum logit as the confidence estimator, can lead to considerable gains in selective classification performance, completely fixing the pathological behavior observed in many classifiers. As a consequence, the selective classification performance of any classifier becomes almost entirely determined by its corresponding accuracy. Moreover, these results are shown to be consistent under distribution shift. 
 ID: 193 | Functional Wasserstein Variational Policy Optimization

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Variational policy optimization has become increasingly attractive to the reinforcement learning community because of its strong capability in uncertainty modeling and environment generalization. However, almost all existing studies in this area rely on Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence which is unfortunately ill-defined in several situations. In addition, the policy is parameterized and optimized in weight space, which may not only bring additional unnecessary bias but also make the policy learning harder due to the complicatedly dependent weight posterior. In the paper, we design a novel functional Wasserstein variational policy optimization (FWVPO) based on the Wasserstein distance between function distributions. Specifically, we firstly parameterize policy as a Bayesian neural network but from a function-space view rather than a weight-space view and then propose FWVPO to optimize and explore the functional policy posterior. We prove that our FWVPO is a valid variational Bayesian objective and also guarantees the monotonic expected reward improvement under certain conditions. Experimental results on multiple reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithm in terms of both cumulative rewards and uncertainty modeling capability.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Graph contrastive learning (CL) methods learn node representations in a self-supervised manner by maximizing the similarity between the augmented node representations obtained via a GNN-based encoder. However, CL methods perform poorly on graphs with heterophily, where connected nodes tend to belong to different classes. In this work, we address this problem by proposing an effective graph CL method, namely HLCL, for learning graph representations under heterophily. HLCL first identifies a homophilic and a heterophilic subgraph based on the cosine similarity of node features. It then uses a low-pass and a high-pass graph filter to aggregate representations of nodes connected in the homophilic subgraph and differentiate representations of nodes in the heterophilic subgraph. The final node representations are learned by contrasting both the augmented high-pass filtered views and the augmented low-pass filtered node views. Our extensive experiments show that HLCL outperforms state-of-the-art graph CL methods on benchmark datasets with heterophily, as well as large-scale real-world graphs, by up to 7%, and outperforms graph supervised learning methods on datasets with heterophily by up to 10%.

  Abstract      
 There has been considerable recent interest in estimating heterogeneous causal effects. In this paper, we study conditional average partial causal effects (CAPCE) to reveal the heterogeneity of causal effects with continuous treatment. We provide conditions for identifying CAPCE in an instrumental variable setting. Notably, CAPCE is identifiable under a weaker assumption than required by a commonly used measure for estimating heterogeneous causal effects of continuous treatment. We develop three families of CAPCE estimators: sieve, parametric, and reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based, and analyze their statistical properties. We illustrate the proposed CAPCE estimators on synthetic and real-world data.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. OOD inputs are commonly expected to cause a more uncertain prediction in the primary task; however, there are OOD cases for which the model returns a highly confident prediction. This phenomenon, denoted as "overconfidence", presents a challenge to OOD detection. Specifically, theoretical evidence indicates that overconfidence is an intrinsic property of certain neural network architectures, leading to poor OOD detection. In this work, we address this issue by measuring extreme activation values in the penultimate layer of neural networks and then leverage this proxy of overconfidence to improve on several OOD detection baselines. We test our method on a wide array of experiments spanning synthetic data and real-world data, tabular and image datasets, multiple architectures such as ResNet and Transformer, different training loss functions, and include the scenarios examined in previous theoretical work. Compared to the baselines, our method often grants substantial improvements, with double-digit increases in OOD detection AUC, and it does not damage performance in any scenario.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Bayesian deep learning (BDL) is an emerging field that combines the strong function approximation power of deep learning with the uncertainty modeling capabilities of Bayesian methods. In addition to those virtues, however, there are accompanying issues brought by such a combination to the classical parameter-space variational inference, such as the nonmeaningful priors, intricate posteriors, and possible pathologies. In this paper, we propose a new function-space variational inference solution called Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference (FWBI), which can assign meaningful functional priors and obtain well-behaved posterior. Specifically, we develop a Wasserstein distance-based bridge to avoid the potential pathological behaviors of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between stochastic processes that arise in most existing functional variational inference approaches. The derived functional variational objective is well-defined and proved to be a lower bound of the model evidence. We demonstrate the improved predictive performance and better uncertainty quantification of our FWBI on several tasks compared with various parameter-space and function-space variational methods.

  Abstract      
 Simulation models often lack tractable likelihood functions, making likelihood-free inference methods indispensable. Approximate Bayesian computation generates likelihood-free posterior samples by comparing simulated and observed data through some distance measure, but existing approaches are often poorly suited to time series simulators, for example due to an independent and identically distributed data assumption. In this paper, we propose to use path signatures in approximate Bayesian computation to handle the sequential nature of time series. We provide theoretical guarantees on the resultant posteriors and demonstrate competitive Bayesian parameter inference for simulators generating univariate, multivariate, and irregularly spaced sequences of non-iid data.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The goal of this paper is to develop distributionally robust optimization (DRO) estimators, specifically for multidimensional Extreme Value Theory (EVT) statistics. EVT supports using semi-parametric models called max-stable distributions built from spatial Poisson point processes. While powerful, these models are only asymptotically valid for large samples. However, since extreme data is by definition scarce, the potential for model misspecification error is inherent to these applications, thus DRO estimators are natural. In order to mitigate over-conservative estimates while enhancing out-of-sample performance, we study DRO estimators informed by semi-parametric max-stable constraints in the space of point processes. We study both tractable convex formulations for some problems of interest (e.g. CVaR) and more general neural network based estimators. Both approaches are validated using synthetically generated data, recovering prescribed characteristics, and verifying the efficacy of the proposed techniques. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to a real data set of financial returns for comparison to a previous analysis. We established the proposed model as a novel formulation in the multivariate EVT domain, and innovative with respect to performance when compared to relevant alternate proposals.

  Abstract      
 For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt tuning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize the tuning process by minimizing the statistic distance between the visual patches and linguistic prompts, which pushes the stochastic label representations to faithfully capture diverse visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on four tasks: few-shot image recognition, base-to-new generalization, dataset transfer learning, and domain shifts. Extensive results on over 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  Abstract      
 Diffusion models have become the go-to method for large-scale generative models in real-world applications. These applications often involve data distributions confined within bounded domains, typically requiring ad-hoc thresholding techniques for boundary enforcement. Reflected diffusion models aim to enhance generalizability by generating the data distribution through a backward process governed by reflected Brownian motion. However, reflected diffusion models may not easily adapt to diverse domains without the derivation of proper diffeomorphic mappings and do not guarantee optimal transport properties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Reflected Schrödinger Bridge algorithm—an entropy-regularized optimal transport approach tailored for generating data within diverse bounded domains. We derive elegant reflected forward-backward stochastic differential equations with Neumann and Robin boundary conditions, extend divergence-based likelihood training to bounded domains, and explore natural connections to entropic optimal transport for the study of approximate linear convergence—a valuable insight for practical training. Our algorithm yields robust generative modeling in diverse domains, and its scalability is demonstrated in real-world constrained generative modeling through standard image benchmarks.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In crowdsourcing scenarios, we can obtain multiple noisy labels from different crowd workers on the Internet for each instance and then infer its unknown true label via a label integration method. However, noisy labels often have a serious negative impact on label integration. In this case, most existing works always focus on designing more complex label integration methods to infer unknown true labels more accurately from multiple noisy labels, but little attention has been paid to another perspective, i.e., purifying noisy labels before label integration. In this paper, we aim to purify noisy labels for existing label integration methods and propose a label consistency-based worker filtering (LCWF) algorithm. In LCWF, we consider that if all low-quality workers are filtered out and only high-quality workers remain, the label consistency should be high. Therefore, we utilize label consistency to filter out low-quality workers. Firstly, we directly transform the worker filtering problem into a discrete optimization problem and utilize label consistency to define the fitness function for this problem. Then, we search for the optimal solution to this problem by a genetic algorithm. Finally, we filter out all labels from low-quality workers according to the optimal solution we obtained. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that LCWF can effectively purify noisy labels and improve the integration accuracy of existing label integration methods.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most widely used gradient-based meta-learning, consisting of two optimization loops: an inner loop and outer loop. MAML learns the new task from meta-initialization parameters with an inner update and finds the meta-initialization parameters in the outer loop. In general, the injection of noise into the gradient of the model for augmenting the gradient is one of the widely used regularization methods. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative meta-learning framework dubbed CML which leverages gradient-level regularization with gradient augmentation. We inject learnable noise into the gradient of the model for the model generalization. The key idea of CML is introducing the co-learner which has no inner update but the outer loop update to augment gradients for finding better meta-initialization parameters. Since the co-learner does not update in the inner loop, it can be easily deleted after meta-training. Therefore, CML infers with only meta-learner without additional cost and performance degradation. We demonstrate that CML is easily applicable to gradient-based meta-learning methods and CML leads to increased performance in few-shot regression, few-shot image classification and few-shot node classification tasks.

 Xingzi Xu, Ali Hasan, Jie Ding, Vahid Tarokh  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows, value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance. It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution.%tasks. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving new PDEs.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We propose a modified density estimation problem that is highly effective for detecting anomalies in tabular data. Our approach assumes that the density function is relatively stable (with lower variance) around normal samples. We have verified this hypothesis empirically using a wide range of real-world data. Then, we present a variance-stabilized density estimation problem for maximizing the likelihood of the observed samples while minimizing the variance of the density around normal samples. To obtain a reliable anomaly detector, we introduce a spectral ensemble of autoregressive models for learning the variance-stabilized distribution. We have conducted an extensive benchmark with 52 datasets, demonstrating that our method leads to state-of-the-art results while alleviating the need for data-specific hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we have used an ablation study to demonstrate the importance of each of the proposed components, followed by a stability analysis evaluating the robustness of our model.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Prior work applying semiparametric theory to causal inference has primarily focused on deriving estimators that exhibit statistical robustness under a prespecified causal model that permits identification of a desired causal parameter. However, a fundamental challenge is correct specification of such a model, which usually involves making untestable assumptions. Evidence factors is an approach to combining hypothesis tests of a common causal null hypothesis under two or more candidate causal models. Under certain conditions, this yields a test that is valid if at least one of the underlying models is correct, which is a form of causal robustness. We propose a method of combining semiparametric theory with evidence factors. We develop a causal null hypothesis test based on joint asymptotic normality of $K$ asymptotically linear semiparametric estimators, where each estimator is based on a distinct identifying functional derived from each of $K$ candidate causal models. We show that this test provides both statistical and causal robustness in the sense that it is valid if at least one of the $K$ proposed causal models is correct, while also allowing for slower than parametric rates of convergence in estimating nuisance functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via simulations and applications to the Framingham Heart Study and Wisconsin Longitudinal Study.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Contextual Bayesian Optimization (CBO) efficiently optimizes black-box functions with respect to design variables, while simultaneously integrating _contextual_ information regarding the environment, such as experimental conditions. However, the relevance of contextual variables is not necessarily known beforehand. Moreover, contextual variables can sometimes be optimized themselves at additional cost, a setting overlooked by current CBO algorithms. Cost-sensitive CBO would simply include optimizable contextual variables as part of the design variables based on their cost. Instead, we adaptively select a subset of contextual variables to include in the optimization, based on the trade-off between their _relevance_ and the additional cost incurred by optimizing them compared to leaving them to be determined by the environment. We learn the relevance of contextual variables by sensitivity analysis of the posterior surrogate model while minimizing the cost of optimization by leveraging recent developments on early stopping for BO. We empirically evaluate our proposed Sensitivity-Analysis-Driven Contextual BO (_SADCBO_) method against alternatives on both synthetic and real-world experiments, together with extensive ablation studies, and demonstrate a consistent improvement across examples. 
 ID: 240 | Posterior Inference on Shallow Infinitely Wide Bayesian Neural Networks under Weights with Unbounded Variance  
  
 Jorge Loria, Anindya Bhadra  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 From the classical and influential works of Neal (1996), it is known that the infinite width scaling limit of a Bayesian neural network with one hidden layer is a Gaussian process, when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Neal's result has been extended to networks with multiple hidden layers and to convolutional neural networks, also with Gaussian process scaling limits. The tractable properties of Gaussian processes then allow straightforward posterior inference and uncertainty quantification, considerably simplifying the study of the limit process compared to a network of finite width. Neural network weights with unbounded variance, however, pose unique challenges. In this case, the classical central limit theorem breaks down and it is well known that the scaling limit is an $\alpha$-stable process under suitable conditions. However, current literature is primarily limited to forward simulations under these processes and the problem of posterior inference under such a scaling limit remains largely unaddressed, unlike in the Gaussian process case. To this end, our contribution is an interpretable and computationally efficient procedure for posterior inference, using a conditionally Gaussian representation, that then allows full use of the Gaussian process machinery for tractable posterior inference and uncertainty quantification in the non-Gaussian regime.

  Abstract      
 This paper studies how to tune the stepping schedule in diffusion models, which is mostly fixed in current practice, lacking theoretical foundations and assurance of optimal performance at the chosen discretization points. In this paper, we advocate the use of adaptive time-stepping schedules and design two algorithms with an optimized sampling error bound $EB$: (1) for continuous diffusion, we treat $EB$ as the loss function to discretization points and run gradient descent to adjust them; and (2) for discrete diffusion, we propose a greedy algorithm that adjusts only one discretization point to its best position in each iteration. We conducted extensive experiments that show (1) improved generation ability in well-trained models, and (2) premature though usable generation ability in under-trained models. The code is submitted and will be released publicly.

  Abstract      
 Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a promising avenue to perform embedded reasoning under uncertainty. They support efficient and exact computation of various probabilistic inference tasks by design. Hence, hardware-efficient computation of PCs is highly interesting for edge computing applications. As computations in PCs are based on arithmetic with probability values, they are typically performed in the log domain to avoid underflow. Unfortunately, performing the log operation on hardware is costly. Hence, prior work has focused on computations in the linear domain, resulting in high resolution and energy requirements. This work proposes the first dedicated approximate computing framework for PCs that allows for low-resolution logarithm computations. We leverage Addition As Int, resulting in linear PC computation with simple hardware elements. Further, we provide a theoretical approximation error analysis and present an error compensation mechanism. Empirically, our method obtains up to 357× and 649× energy reduction on custom hardware for evidence and MAP queries respectively with little or no computational error.

 Ofir Lindenbaum, Yariv Aizenbud, Yuval Kluger  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Accurate detection of outliers is crucial for the success of numerous data analysis tasks. In this context, we propose the Probabilistic Robust AutoEncoder (PRAE) that can simultaneously remove outliers during training (transductive) and learn a mapping that can be used to detect outliers in new data (inductive). We first present the Robust AutoEncoder (RAE) objective that excludes outliers while including a subset of samples (inliers) that can be effectively reconstructed using an AutoEncoder (AE). RAE minimizes the autoencoder's reconstruction error while incorporating as many samples as possible. This could be formulated via regularization by subtracting an $\ell_0$ norm, counting the number of selected samples from the reconstruction term. As this leads to an intractable combinatorial problem, we propose two probabilistic relaxations of RAE, which are differentiable and alleviate the need for a combinatorial search. We prove that the solution to the PRAE problem is equivalent to the solution of RAE. We then use synthetic data to demonstrate that PRAE can accurately remove outliers in various contamination levels. Finally, we show that using PRAE for outlier detection leads to state-of-the-art results for inductive and transductive outlier detection. 
 ID: 264 | Bootstrap Your Conversions: Thompson Sampling for Partially Observable Delayed Rewards  
  
 Marco Gigli, Fabio Stella  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 This paper presents a novel approach to address contextual bandit problems with partially observable, delayed feedback by introducing an approximate Thompson sampling technique. This is a common setting, with applications ranging from online marketing to vaccine trials. Leveraging Bootstrapped Thompson sampling (BTS), we obtain an approximate posterior distribution over delay distributions and conversion probabilities, thereby extending an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) model to the Bayesian domain. Unlike prior methodologies, our approach does not overlook uncertainty on delays. Within the EM framework, we employ the Kaplan-Meier estimator to place no restriction on delay distributions. Through extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art techniques, our approach demonstrates superior performance across the majority of tested environments, with comparable performance in the remaining cases. Furthermore, our method offers practical implementation using off-the-shelf libraries, facilitating broader adoption. Our technique lays a foundation for extending to other bandit settings, such as non-contextual bandits or action-dependent delay distributions, promising wider applicability and versatility in real-world applications.

 Lorenzo Zambon, Dario Azzimonti, Nicolò Rubattu, Giorgio Corani  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Hierarchical time series are collections of time series that are formed via aggregation, and thus adhere to some linear constraints. The forecasts for hierarchical time series should be coherent, i.e., they should satisfy the same constraints. In a probabilistic setting, forecasts are in the form of predictive distributions. Probabilistic reconciliation adjusts the predictive distributions, yielding a joint reconciled distribution that assigns positive probability only to coherent forecasts. There are methods for the reconciliation of hierarchies containing only Gaussian or only discrete predictive distributions; instead, the reconciliation of mixed hierarchies, i.e. mixtures of discrete and continuous time series, is still an open problem. We propose two different approaches to address this problem: mixed conditioning and top-down conditioning. We discuss their properties and we present experiments with datasets containing up to thousands of time series. 
 ID: 269 | Center-Based Relaxed Learning Against Membership Inference Attacks  
  
 Xingli Fang, Jung-Eun Kim  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are currently considered one of the main privacy attack strategies, and their defense mechanisms have also been extensively explored. However, there is still a gap between the existing defense approaches and ideal models in both performance and deployment costs. In particular, we observed that the privacy vulnerability of the model is closely correlated with the gap between the model's data-memorizing ability and generalization ability. To address it, we propose a new architecture-agnostic training paradigm called Center-based Relaxed Learning (CRL), which is adaptive to any classification model and provides privacy preservation by sacrificing a minimal or no loss of model generalizability. We emphasize that CRL can better maintain the model's consistency between member and non-member data. Through extensive experiments on common classification datasets, we empirically show that this approach exhibits comparable performance without requiring additional model capacity or data costs.

 Leonard Henckel, Theo Würtzen, Sebastian Weichwald  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Evaluating graphs learned by causal discovery algorithms is difficult: The number of edges that differ between two graphs does not reflect how the graphs differ with respect to the identifying formulas they suggest for causal effects. We introduce a framework for developing causal distances between graphs which includes the structural intervention distance for directed acyclic graphs as a special case. We use this framework to develop improved adjustment-based distances as well as extensions to completed partially directed acyclic graphs and causal orders. We develop new reachability algorithms to compute the distances efficiently and to prove their low polynomial time complexity. In our package gadjid (open source at https://github.com/CausalDisco/gadjid), we provide implementations of our distances; they are orders of magnitude faster with proven lower time complexity than the structural intervention distance and thereby provide a success metric for causal discovery that scales to graph sizes that were previously prohibitive.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We investigate the optimal transport problem between probability measures when the underlying cost function is understood to satisfy a least action principle, also known as a Lagrangian cost. These generalizations are useful when connecting observations from a physical system where the transport dynamics are influenced by the geometry of the system, such as obstacles (e.g., incorporating barrier functions in the Lagrangian), and allows practitioners to incorporate a priori knowledge of the underlying system such as non-Euclidean geometries (e.g., paths must be circular). Our contributions are of computational interest, where we demonstrate the ability to efficiently compute geodesics and amortize spline-based paths, which has not been done before, even in low dimensional problems. Unlike prior work, we also output the resulting Lagrangian optimal transport map without requiring an ODE solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation on low-dimensional examples taken from prior work. The source code to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/lagrangian-ot.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL) aims to derive a policy optimizing the worst-case performance within a predefined uncertainty set. Despite extensive research, previous DR-RL algorithms have predominantly favored model-based approaches, with limited availability of model-free methods offering convergence guarantees or sample complexities. This paper proposes a model-free DR-RL algorithm leveraging the Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) technique to close such a gap. Our innovative approach integrates a threshold mechanism that ensures finite sample requirements for algorithmic implementation, a significant departure from previous model-free algorithms. We adapt our algorithm to accommodate uncertainty sets defined by total variation, Chi-square divergence, and KL divergence, and provide finite sample analyses under all three cases. Remarkably, our algorithms represent the first model-free DR-RL approach featuring finite sample complexity for total variation and Chi-square divergence uncertainty sets, while also offering an improved sample complexity and broader applicability compared to existing model-free DR-RL algorithms for the KL divergence model. The complexities of our method establish the tightest results for all three uncertainty models in model-free DR-RL, underscoring the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm, and highlighting its potential for practical applications.

  Abstract      
 We propose a novel approach for estimating conditional or parametric expectations in the setting where obtaining samples or evaluating integrands is costly. Through the framework of probabilistic numerical methods (such as Bayesian quadrature), our novel approach allows to incorporates prior information about the integrands especially the prior smoothness knowledge about the integrands and the conditional expectation. As a result, our approach provides a way of quantifying uncertainty and leads to a fast convergence rate, which is confirmed both theoretically and empirically on challenging tasks in Bayesian sensitivity analysis, computational finance and decision making under uncertainty. 
 ID: 288 | Characterizing Data Point Vulnerability as Average-Case Robustness  
  
 Tessa Han, Suraj Srinivas, Himabindu Lakkaraju  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Studying the robustness of machine learning models is important to ensure consistent model behaviour across real-world settings. To this end, adversarial robustness is a standard framework, which views robustness of predictions through a binary lens: either a worst-case adversarial perturbation exists in the local region around an input, or it does not. However, this binary perspective does not account for the degrees of vulnerability, as data points with a larger number of misclassified examples in their neighborhoods are more vulnerable. In this work, we consider a complementary framework for robustness, called average-case robustness, which measures the fraction of points in a local region that provides consistent predictions. However, computing this quantity is hard, as standard Monte Carlo approaches are inefficient especially for high-dimensional inputs. In this work, we propose the first analytical estimators for average-case robustness for multi-class classifiers. We show empirically that our estimators are accurate and efficient for standard deep learning models and demonstrate their usefulness for identifying vulnerable data points, and well as quantifying robustness bias of models. Overall, our tools provide a complementary view to robustness, improving our ability to characterize model behaviour.

  Abstract      
 By querying approximate surrogate models of different fidelity as available information sources, Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (MFBO) aims at optimizing unknown functions that are costly if not infeasible to evaluate. Existing MFBO methods often assume that approximate surrogates have consistently high/low fidelity across the input domain. However, approximate evaluations from the same surrogate can have different fidelity at different input regions due to data availability and model constraints, especially when considering machine learning surrogates. In this work, we investigate MFBO when multi-fidelity approximations have input-dependent fidelity. By explicitly capturing input dependency for multi-fidelity queries in Gaussian Process (GP), our new input-dependent MFBO~(iMFBO) with learnable noise models better captures the fidelity of each information source in an intuitive way. We further design a new acquisition function for iMFBO and prove that the queries selected by iMFBO have higher quality than those by naive MFBO methods, with the derived sub-linear regret bound. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate its superior empirical performance. 
 ID: 302 | Approximation Algorithms for Observer Aware MDPs

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We present approximation algorithms for Observer-Aware Markov Decision Processes (OAMDPs). OAMDPs model sequential decision-making problems in which rewards depend on the beliefs of an observer about the goals, intentions, or capabilities of the observed agent. The first proposed algorithm is a grid-based value iteration (Grid-VI), which discretizes the observer's belief into regular grids. Based on the same discretization, the second proposed algorithm is a variant of Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) called Grid-RTDP. Unlike Grid-Vi, Grid-RTDP focuses its updates on promising states using heuristic estimates. We provide theoretical guarantees of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that Grid-RTDP has a good anytime performance comparable to the existing approach without performance guarantees.

  Abstract      
 We consider the problem of sampling from a discrete and structured distribution as a sequential decision problem, where the objective is to find a stochastic policy such that objects are sampled at the end of this sequential process proportionally to some predefined reward. While we could use maximum entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) to solve this problem for some distributions, it has been shown that in general, the distribution over states induced by the optimal policy may be biased in cases where there are multiple ways to generate the same object. To address this issue, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) learn a stochastic policy that samples objects proportionally to their reward by approximately enforcing a conservation of flows across the whole Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we extend recent methods correcting the reward in order to guarantee that the marginal distribution induced by the optimal MaxEnt RL policy is proportional to the original reward, regardless of the structure of the underlying MDP. We also prove that some flow-matching objectives found in the GFlowNet literature are in fact equivalent to well-established MaxEnt RL algorithms with a corrected reward. Finally, we study empirically the performance of multiple MaxEnt RL and GFlowNet algorithms on multiple problems involving sampling from discrete distributions.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Denoising diffusion models are a class of generative models that have recently achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. Gradual noise is added to the data using a diffusion process, which transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian. Samples from the generative model are then obtained by simulating an approximation of the time reversal of this diffusion initialized by Gaussian samples. Recent research has explored the sampling error achieved by diffusion models under the assumption of an absolute error $\epsilon$ achieved via a neural approximation of the score. To the best of our knowledge, no work formally quantifies the error of such neural approximation to the score. In this paper, we close the gap and present quantitative error bounds for approximating the score of denoising diffusion models using neural networks leveraging ideas from stochastic control. Finally, through simulation, we explore some of the insights that arise from our results confirming that diffusion models based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process require fewer parameters to better approximate the score than those based on the F\"{o}lmer drift / Pinned Brownian Motion."

  Abstract      
 We study the federated pure exploration problem of multi-armed bandits and linear bandits, where $M$ agents cooperatively identify the best arm via communicating with the central server. To enhance the robustness against latency and unavailability of agents that are common in practice, we propose the first federated asynchronous multi-armed bandit and linear bandit algorithms for pure exploration with fixed confidence. Our theoretical analysis shows the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal sample complexities and efficient communication costs in a fully asynchronous environment. Moreover, experimental results based on synthetic and real-world data empirically elucidate the effectiveness and communication cost-efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Conformal prediction methods are a tool for uncertainty quantification of a model's prediction, providing a model-agnostic and distribution-free statistical wrapper that generates prediction intervals/sets for a given model with finite sample generalization guarantees. However, these guarantees hold only on average, or conditioned on the output values of the predictor or on a set of predefined groups, which a-priori may not relate to the prediction task at hand. We propose a method to learn a generalizable partition function of the input space (or representation mapping) into interpretable groups of varying sizes where the non-conformity scores - a measure of discrepancy between prediction and target - are as homogeneous as possible when conditioned to the group. The learned partition can be integrated with any of the group conditional conformal approaches to produce conformal sets with group conditional guarantees on the discovered regions. Since these learned groups are expressed as strictly a function of the input, they can be used for downstream tasks such as data collection or model selection. We show the effectiveness of our method in reducing worst case group coverage outcomes in a variety of datasets.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Two-sided matching under uncertainty has recently drawn much attention due to its wide applications. Existing works in matching bandits mainly focus on the one-sided learning setting and design algorithms with the objective of converging to stable matching with low regret. In this paper, we consider the more general two-sided learning setting, i.e. participants on both sides have to learn their preferences over the other side through repeated interactions. Inspired by the classical result that the optimal matching for the proposing side can be obtained using the Gale-Shapley algorithm, our inquiry stems from the curiosity about whether this result still holds in a two-sided learning setting. To handle this question, we formally introduce the two-sided learning setting, addressing strategies for both the arm and player sides without restrictive assumptions such as special preference structure and observation of winning players. Our results not only provide a positive answer to our inquiry but also offer a near-optimal upper bound, achieving $O(\log T)$ regret.

  Abstract      
 Among the existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) frameworks usually automatically generate supervision by transforming the same graph into different views through graph augmentation operations. The computation-efficient augmentation techniques enable the prevalent usage of GCL to alleviate the supervision shortage issue. Despite the remarkable performance of those GCL methods, the InfoMax principle used to guide the optimization of GCL has been proven to be insufficient to avoid redundant information without losing important features. In light of this, we introduce the Graph Contrastive Learning with Cross-View Reconstruction (GCVR), aiming to learn robust and sufficient representation from graph data. Specifically, GCVR introduces a cross-view reconstruction mechanism based on conventional graph contrastive learning to elicit those essential features from raw graphs. Besides, we introduce an extra adversarial view perturbed from the original view in the contrastive loss to pursue the intactness of the graph semantics and strengthen the representation robustness. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on graph classification tasks over multiple benchmark datasets.

 [spotlight]

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Increasing the size of overparameterized neural networks has been a key in achieving state-of-the-art performance. This is captured by the double descent phenomenon, where the test loss follows a decreasing-increasing-decreasing pattern (or sometimes monotonically decreasing) as model width increases. However, the effect of label noise on the test loss curve has not been fully explored. In this work, we uncover an intriguing phenomenon where label noise leads to a \textit{final ascent} in the originally observed double descent curve. Specifically, under a sufficiently large noise-to-sample-size ratio, optimal generalization is achieved at intermediate widths. Through theoretical analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to the shape transition of test loss variance induced by label noise. Furthermore, we extend the final ascent phenomenon to model density and provide the first theoretical characterization showing that reducing density by randomly dropping trainable parameters improves generalization under label noise. We also thoroughly examine the roles of regularization and sample size. Surprisingly, we find that larger $\ell_2$ regularization and robust learning methods against label noise exacerbate the final ascent. We confirm the validity of our findings through extensive experiments on ReLu networks trained on MNIST, ResNets/ViT trained on CIFAR-10/100, and InceptionResNet-v2 trained on Stanford Cars with real-world noisy labels.

  Abstract      
 In critical machine learning applications, ensuring fairness is essential to avoid perpetuating social inequities. In this work, we address the challenges of reducing bias and improving accuracy in data-scarce environments, where the cost of collecting labeled data prohibits the use of large, labeled datasets. In such settings, active learning promises to maximize marginal accuracy gains of small amounts of labeled data. However, existing applications of active learning for fairness fail to deliver on this, typically requiring large labeled datasets, or failing to ensure the desired fairness tolerance is met on the population distribution. To address such limitations, we introduce an innovative active learning framework that combines an exploration procedure inspired by posterior sampling with a fair classification subroutine. We demonstrate that this framework performs effectively in very data-scarce regimes, maximizing accuracy while satisfying fairness constraints with high probability. We evaluate our proposed approach using well-established real-world benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing fair models, and improvement over existing methods.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) has been widely utilized in fields such as recommendation systems, graph learning, text mining, and -omics data analysis. Traditional BMF methods decompose a binary matrix into the Boolean product of two lower-rank Boolean matrices plus homoscedastic random errors. However, real-world binary data typically involves biases arising from heterogeneous row- and column-wise signal distributions. Such biases can lead to suboptimal fitting and unexplainable predictions if not accounted for. In this study, we reconceptualize the binary data generation as the Boolean sum of three components: a binary pattern matrix, a background bias matrix influenced by heterogeneous row or column distributions, and random flipping errors. We introduce a novel Disentangled Representation Learning for Binary matrices (DRLB) method, which employs a dual auto-encoder network to reveal the true patterns. DRLB can be seamlessly integrated with existing BMF techniques to facilitate bias-aware BMF. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets show that DRLB significantly enhances the precision of traditional BMF methods while offering high scalability. Moreover, the bias matrix detected by DRLB accurately reflects the inherent biases in synthetic data, and the patterns identified in the bias-corrected real-world data exhibit enhanced interpretability. 
 ID: 327 | EntProp: High Entropy Propagation for Improving Accuracy and Robustness  
  
 Shohei Enomoto  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution domains that are different from those in training despite their impressive performance. In practical applications, it is important for DNNs to have both high standard accuracy and robustness against out-of-distribution domains. One technique that achieves both of these improvements is disentangled learning with mixture distribution via auxiliary batch normalization layers (ABNs). This technique treats clean and transformed samples as different domains, allowing a DNN to learn better features from mixed domains. However, if we distinguish the domains of the samples based on entropy, we find that some transformed samples are drawn from the same domain as clean samples, and these samples are not completely different domains. To generate samples drawn from a completely different domain than clean samples, we hypothesize that transforming clean high-entropy samples to further increase the entropy generates out-of-distribution samples that are much further away from the in-distribution domain. On the basis of the hypothesis, we propose high entropy propagation~(EntProp), which feeds high-entropy samples to the network that uses ABNs. We introduce two techniques, data augmentation and free adversarial training, that increase entropy and bring the sample further away from the in-distribution domain. These techniques do not require additional training costs. Our experimental results show that EntProp achieves higher standard accuracy and robustness with a lower training cost than the baseline methods. In particular, EntProp is highly effective at training on small datasets.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We consider the quantum kernelized bandit problem, where the player observes information of rewards through quantum circuits termed the quantum reward oracle, and the mean reward function belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We propose a UCB-type algorithm that utilizes the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method and provide regret bounds in terms of the decay rate of eigenvalues of the Mercer operator of the kernel. Our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}\left( T^{\frac{3}{1 + \beta_p}} \log\left(\frac{1}{\delta} \right)\right)$ and $\widetilde{O} \left( \log^{3(1 + \beta_e^{-1})/2} (T) \log\left(\frac{1 }{\delta} \right) \right)$ cumulative regret bounds with probability at least $1-\delta$ if the kernel has a $\beta_p$-polynomial eigendecay and $\beta_e$-exponential eigendecay, respectively. In particular, in the case of the exponential eigendecay, our regret bounds exponentially improve that of classical algorithms. Moreover, our results indicate that our regret bound is better than the lower bound in the classical kernelized bandit problem if the rate of decay is sufficiently fast.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Advancing loss function design is pivotal for optimizing neural network training and performance. This work introduces Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, a novel approach that enhances training efficiency by leveraging geometric relationships within the data. Distinct from traditional loss functions that target minimizing pointwise errors, RLP loss operates by minimizing the distance between sets of hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs. Our empirical evaluations, conducted across benchmark datasets and synthetic examples, demonstrate that neural networks trained with RLP loss outperform those trained with traditional loss functions, achieving improved performance with fewer data samples, and exhibiting greater robustness to additive noise. We provide theoretical analysis supporting our empirical findings. 
 ID: 345 | Revisiting Convergence of AdaGrad with Relaxed Assumptions  
  
 Yusu Hong, Junhong Lin  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In this study, we revisit the convergence of AdaGrad with momentum (covering AdaGrad as a special case) on non-convex smooth optimization problems. We consider a general noise model where the noise magnitude is controlled by the function value gap together with the gradient magnitude. This model encompasses a broad range of noises including bounded noise, sub-Gaussian noise, affine variance noise and the expected smoothness, and it has been shown to be more realistic in many practical applications. Our analysis yields a probabilistic convergence rate which, under the general noise, could reach at $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$. This rate does not rely on prior knowledge of problem-parameters and could accelerate to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T)$ where $T$ denotes the total number iterations, when the noise parameters related to the function value gap and noise level are sufficiently small. The convergence rate thus matches the lower rate for stochastic first-order methods over non-convex smooth landscape up to logarithm terms [Arjevani et al., 2023]. We further derive a convergence bound for AdaGrad with momentum, considering the generalized smoothness where the local smoothness is controlled by a first-order function of the gradient norm. 
 ID: 346 | Memorization Capacity for Additive Fine-Tuning with Small ReLu Networks

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is a common practice in machine learning applications, yet its mathematical analysis remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study fine-tuning through the lens of memorization capacity. Our new measure, the Fine-Tuning Capacity (FTC), is defined as the maximum number of samples a neural network can fine-tune, or equivalently, as the minimum number of neurons ($m$) needed to arbitrarily change $N$ labels among $K$ samples considered in the fine-tuning process. In essence, FTC extends the memorization capacity concept to the fine-tuning scenario. We analyze FTC for the additive fine-tuning scenario where the fine-tuned network is defined as the summation of the frozen pre-trained network $f$ and a neural network $g$ (with $m$ neurons) designed for fine-tuning. When $g$ is a ReLU network with either 2 or 3 layers, we obtain tight upper and lower bounds on FTC; we show that $N$ samples can be fine-tuned with $m=\Theta(N)$ neurons for 2-layer networks, and with $m=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ neurons for 3-layer networks, no matter how large $K$ is. Our results recover the known memorization capacity results when $N = K$ as a special case. 
 ID: 352 | Approximate Kernel Density Estimation under Metric-based Local Differential Privacy

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a fundamental problem with broad machine learning applications. In this paper, we investigate the KDE problem under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), a setting in which users privatize data on their own devices before sending them to an untrusted server for analytics. To strike a balance between ensuring local privacy and preserving high-utility KDE results, we adopt a relaxed definition of LDP based on metrics (mLDP), which is suitable when data points are represented in a metric space and can be more distinguishable as their distances increase. To the best of our knowledge, approximate KDE under mLDP has not been explored in the existing literature. We propose the mLDP-KDE framework, which augments a locality-sensitive hashing-based sketch method to provide mLDP and answer any KDE query unbiasedly within an additive error with high probability in sublinear time and space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the mLDP-KDE framework outperforms several existing KDE methods under LDP and mLDP by achieving significantly better trade-offs between privacy and utility, with particularly remarkable advantages on large, high-dimensional data.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Rating elicitation is a success element for recommender systems to perform well at cold-starting, in which the systems need to recommend items to a newly arrived user with no prior knowledge about the user's preference. Existing elicitation methods employ a fixed set of items to learn the user's preference and then infer the users' preferences on the remaining items. Using a fixed seed set can limit the performance of the recommendation system since the seed set is unlikely optimal for all new users with potentially diverse preferences. This paper addresses this challenge using a 2-phase, personalized elicitation scheme. First, the elicitation scheme asks users to rate a small set of popular items in a ``burn-in'' phase. Second, it sequentially asks the user to rate adaptive items to refine the preference and the user's representation. Throughout the process, the system represents the user's embedding value not by a point estimate but by a region estimate. The value of information obtained by asking the user's rating on an item is quantified by the distance from the region center embedding space that contains with high confidence the true embedding value of the user. Finally, the recommendations are successively generated by considering the preference region of the user. We show that each subproblem in the elicitation scheme can be efficiently implemented. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing rating-elicitation methods on several prominent datasets.

  Abstract      
 Labeling data via rules-of-thumb and minimal label supervision is central to Weak Supervision, a paradigm subsuming subareas of machine learning such as crowdsourced learning and semi-supervised ensemble learning. By using this labeled data to train modern machine learning methods, the cost of acquiring large amounts of hand labeled data can be ameliorated. Approaches to combining the rules-of-thumb falls into two camps, reflecting different ideologies of statistical estimation. The most common approach, exemplified by the Dawid-Skene model, is based on probabilistic modeling. The other, developed in the work of Balsubramani-Freund and others, is adversarial and game-theoretic. We provide a variety of statistical results for the adversarial approach under log-loss: we characterize the form of the solution, relate it to logistic regression, demonstrate consistency, and give rates of convergence. On the other hand, we find that probabilistic approaches for the same model class can fail to be consistent. Experimental results are provided to corroborate the theoretical results.

  Abstract      
 We investigate popular resampling methods for estimating the uncertainty of statistical models, such as subsampling, bootstrap and the jackknife, and their performance in high-dimensional supervised regression tasks. We provide a tight asymptotic description of the biases and variances estimated by these methods in the context of generalized linear models, such as ridge and logistic regression, taking the limit where the number of samples $n$ and dimension $d$ of the covariates grow at a comparable rate: $\alpha=n/d$ fixed. Our findings are three-fold: i) resampling methods are fraught with problems in high dimensions and exhibit the double-descent-like behavior typical of these situations; ii) only when $\alpha$ is large enough do they provide consistent and reliable error estimations (we give convergence rates); iii) in the over-parametrized regime $\alpha<1$ relevant to modern machine learning practice, their predictions are not consistent, even with optimal regularization.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Structural Causal Models (SCMs) are an important tool in causal inference. They induce a graph and if the graph is acyclic, a unique observational distribution. A standard result states that in this acyclic case, the induced observational distribution satisfies a d-separation global Markov property relative to the induced graph. Time series can also be modelled like SCMs: One just interprets the stochastic difference equations that a time series solves as structural equations. However, technical problems arise when time series "start" at minus infinity. In particular, a d-separation global Markov property for time series and the corresponding infinite graphs, the so-called full time graphs, has thus far only been shown for stable vector autoregressive processes with independent finite-second-moment noise. In this paper, we prove a much more general version of this Markov property. We discuss our assumptions and study violations of them. Doing so hints at several pitfalls at the intersection of time series analysis and causal inference. Moreover, we introduce a new projection procedure for these infinite graphs which might be of independent interest.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Bayesian deep learning provides a framework for quantifying uncertainty. However, the scale of modern neural networks applied in Natural Language Processing (NLP) limits the usability of Bayesian methods. Subnetwork inference aims to approximate the posterior by selecting a stochastic parameter subset for inference, thereby allowing scalable posterior approximations. Determining the optimal parameter space for subnetwork inference is far from trivial. In this paper, we study partially stochastic Bayesian neural networks in the context of transformer models for NLP tasks for the Laplace approximation (LA) and Stochastic weight averaging - Gaussian (SWAG). We propose heuristics for selecting which layers to include in the stochastic subset. We show that norm-based selection is promising for small subsets, and random selection is superior for larger subsets. Moreover, we propose Sparse-KFAC (S-KFAC), an extension of KFAC LA, which selects dense stochastic substructures of linear layers based on parameter magnitudes. S-KFAC retains performance while requiring substantially fewer stochastic parameters and, therefore, drastically limits memory footprint.

 Young-Jin Park, Hao Wang, Shervin Ardeshir, Navid Azizan  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Self-supervised learning models extract general-purpose representations from data. Quantifying the reliability of these representations is crucial, as many downstream models rely on them as input for their own tasks. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of _representation reliability_: the representation for a given test point is considered to be reliable if the downstream models built on top of that representation can consistently generate accurate predictions for that test point. However, accessing downstream data to quantify the representation reliability is often infeasible or restricted due to privacy concerns. We propose an ensemble-based method for estimating the representation reliability without knowing the downstream tasks a priori. Our method is based on the concept of _neighborhood consistency_ across distinct pre-trained representation spaces. The key insight is to find shared neighboring points as anchors to align these representation spaces before comparing them. We demonstrate through comprehensive numerical experiments that our method effectively captures the representation reliability with a high degree of correlation, achieving robust and favorable performance compared with baseline methods.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 When Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are deployed in practice, they might impact their environment and change its dynamics. We propose a new framework to model this phenomenon, where the current environment depends on the deployed policy as well as its previous dynamics. This is a generalization of Performative RL (PRL) [Mandal et al., 2023]. Unlike PRL, our framework allows to model scenarios where the environment gradually adjusts to a deployed policy. We adapt two algorithms from the performative prediction literature to our setting and propose a novel algorithm called Mixed Delayed Repeated Retraining (MDRR). We provide conditions under which these algorithms converge and compare them using three metrics: number of retrainings, approximation guarantee, and number of samples per deployment. MDRR is the first algorithm in this setting which combines samples from multiple deployments in its training. This makes MDRR particularly suitable for scenarios where the environment's response strongly depends on its previous dynamics, which are common in practice. We experimentally compare the algorithms using a simulation-based testbed and our results show that MDRR converges significantly faster than previous approaches.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Real-world applications of machine learning models are often subject to legal or policy-based regulations. Some of these regulations require ensuring the validity of the model, i.e., the approximation error being smaller than a threshold. A global metric is generally too insensitive to determine the validity of a specific prediction, whereas evaluating local validity is costly since it requires gathering additional data. We propose learning the model error to acquire a local validity estimate while reducing the amount of required data through active learning. Using model validation benchmarks, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed method can lead to an error model with sufficient discriminative properties using a relatively small amount of data. Furthermore, an increased sensitivity to local changes of the validity bounds compared to alternative approaches is demonstrated.

  Abstract      
 Actor Critic methods have found immense applications on a wide range of Reinforcement Learning tasks especially when the state-action space is large. In this paper, we consider actor critic and natural actor critic algorithms with function approximation for constrained Markov decision processes (C-MDP) involving inequality constraints and carry out a non-asymptotic analysis for both of these algorithms in a non-i.i.d (Markovian) setting. We consider the long-run average cost criterion where both the objective and the constraint functions are suitable policy-dependent long-run averages of certain prescribed cost functions. We handle the inequality constraints using the Lagrange multiplier method. We prove that these algorithms are guaranteed to find a first-order stationary point (i.e., $\Vert \nabla L(\theta,\gamma)\Vert_2^2 \leq \epsilon$) of the performance (Lagrange) function $L(\theta,\gamma)$, with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ in the case of both Constrained Actor Critic (C-AC) and Constrained Natural Actor Critic (C-NAC) algorithms. We also show the results of experiments on three different Safety-Gym environments.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Last-iterate behaviors of learning algorithms in repeated two-player zero-sum games have been extensively studied due to their wide applications in machine learning and related tasks. Typical algorithms that exhibit the last-iterate convergence property include optimistic and extra-gradient methods. However, most existing results establish these properties under the assumption that the game is time-independent. Recently, (Feng et al., 2023) studied the last-iterate behaviors of optimistic and extra-gradient methods in games with a time-varying payoff matrix, and proved that in an unconstrained periodic game, extra-gradient method converges to the equilibrium while optimistic method diverges. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that these two methods are expected to behave similarly as they do in time-independent games. However, compared to unconstrained games, games with constrains are more common both in practical and theoretical studies. In this paper, we investigate the last-iterate behaviors of optimistic and extra-gradient methods in the constrained periodic games, demonstrating that similar separation results for last-iterate convergence also hold in this setting. 
 ID: 386 | Faster Perfect Sampling of Bayesian Network Structures

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Bayesian inference of a Bayesian network structure amounts to averaging over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) on a given set of $n$ variables, each DAG weighted by its posterior probability. In practice, save some special inference tasks, one averages over a sample of DAGs generated perfectly or approximately from the posterior. For the hard problem of perfect sampling, we give an algorithm that runs in $O(2.829^n)$ expected time, getting below $O(3^n)$ for the first time. Our algorithm reduces the problem into two smaller sampling problems whose outputs are combined; followed by a simple rejection step, perfect samples are obtained. Subsequent samples can be generated considerably faster. Empirically, we observe speedups of several orders of magnitude over the state of the art.

  Abstract      
 Importance sampling is a popular technique in Bayesian inference: by reweighting samples drawn from a proposal distribution we are able to obtain samples and moment estimates from a Bayesian posterior over latent variables. Recent work, however, indicates that importance sampling scales poorly --- in order to accurately approximate the true posterior, the required number of importance samples grows is exponential in the number of latent variables [Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018]. Massively parallel importance sampling works around this issue by drawing $K$ samples for each of the $n$ latent variables and reasoning about all $K^n$ combinations of latent samples. In principle, we can reason efficiently over $K^n$ combinations of samples by exploiting conditional independencies in the generative model. However, in practice this requires complex algorithms that traverse backwards through the graphical model, and we need separate backward traversals for each computation (posterior expectations, marginals and samples). Our contribution is to exploit the source term trick from physics to entirely avoid the need to hand-write backward traversals. Instead, we demonstrate how to simply and easily compute all the required quantities --- posterior expectations, marginals and samples --- by differentiating through a slightly modified marginal likelihood estimator.

  Abstract      
 The challenge in learning abstract concepts from images in an unsupervised fashion lies in the required integration of visual perception and generalizable relational reasoning. Moreover, the unsupervised nature of this task makes it necessary for human users to be able to understand a model's learned concepts and potentially revise false behaviors. To tackle both the generalizability and interpretability constraints of visual concept learning, we propose Pix2Code, a framework that extends program synthesis to visual relational reasoning by utilizing the abilities of both explicit, compositional symbolic and implicit neural representations. This is achieved by retrieving object representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts as $\lambda$-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on the challenging reasoning domains, Kandinsky Patterns, and CURI, testing its ability to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data and concept configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural approaches, we show that Pix2Code's representations remain human interpretable and can easily be revised for improved performance.

  Abstract      
 Recent advances in generative models facilitate the creation of synthetic data to be made available for research in privacy-sensitive contexts. However, the analysis of synthetic data raises a unique set of methodological challenges. In this work, we highlight the importance of inferential utility and provide empirical evidence against naive inference from synthetic data, whereby synthetic data are treated as if they were actually observed. Before publishing synthetic data, it is essential to develop statistical inference tools for such data. By means of a simulation study, we show that the rate of false-positive findings (type 1 error) will be unacceptably high, even when the estimates are unbiased. Despite the use of a previously proposed correction factor, this problem persists for deep generative models, in part due to slower convergence of estimators and resulting underestimation of the true standard error. We further demonstrate our findings through a case study.

  Abstract      
 Why does a phenomenon occur? Addressing this question is central to most scientific inquiries and often relies on simulations of scientific models. As models become more intricate, deciphering the causes behind phenomena in high-dimensional spaces of interconnected variables becomes increasingly challenging. Causal Representation Learning (CRL) offers a promising avenue to uncover interpretable causal patterns within these simulations through an interventional lens. However, developing general CRL frameworks suitable for practical applications remains an open challenge. We introduce _Targeted Causal Reduction_ (TCR), a method for condensing complex intervenable models into a concise set of causal factors that explain a specific target phenomenon. We propose an information theoretic objective to learn TCR from interventional data of simulations, establish identifiability for continuous variables under shift interventions and present a practical algorithm for learning TCRs. Its ability to generate interpretable high-level explanations from complex models is demonstrated on toy and mechanical systems, illustrating its potential to assist scientists in the study of complex phenomena in a broad range of disciplines. 
 ID: 411 | A Generalized Bayesian Approach to Distribution-on-Distribution Regression  
  
 Tin Lok James Ng  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In recent years, there has been growing interest in distribution-on-distribution regression, a regression problem where both covariates and responses are represented as probability distributions. Despite various methodologies proposed to address this challenge, a notable absence has been a Bayesian approach, which offers benefits by allowing for the integration of prior knowledge and providing a formal means of quantifying uncertainty. However, a major challenge in employing a Bayesian approach lies in the complexity of fully specifying the data generating process. To overcome this obstacle, we adopt a generalized Bayesian approach and investigate the contraction rates of the resulting generalized (Gibbs) posterior distributions. We propose an MCMC algorithm to sample from the generalized posterior distribution and conduct simulation studies to validate the theoretical findings. Finally, we apply the model to a data application involving mortality data.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Catastrophic forgetting poses a significant challenge in continual learning (CL). In the context of Natural Language Processing, generative-based rehearsal CL methods have made progress in avoiding expensive retraining. However, generating pseudo samples that accurately capture the task-specific distribution remains a daunting task. In this paper, we propose Dirichlet Continual Learning (DCL), a novel generative-based rehearsal strategy designed specifically for CL. Different from the conventional use of Gaussian latent variable in Conditional Variational Autoencoder, DCL employs the flexibility of the Dirichlet distribution to model the latent variable. This allows DCL to effectively capture sentence-level features from previous tasks and guide the generation of pseudo samples. Additionally, we introduce Jensen-Shannon Knowledge Distillation, a robust logit-based knowledge distillation method that enhances knowledge transfer during pseudo-sample generation. Our extensive experiments show that DCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in two typical tasks of task-oriented dialogue systems, demonstrating its efficacy.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Distribution shift detection is paramount in safety-critical tasks that rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The detection task entails deriving a confidence score to assert whether a new input sample aligns with the training data distribution of the DNN model. While DNN predictive uncertainty offers an intuitive confidence measure, exploring uncertainty-based distribution shift detection with simple sample-based techniques has been relatively overlooked in recent years due to computational overhead and lower performance than plain post-hoc methods. This paper proposes using simple sample-based techniques for estimating uncertainty and employing the entropy density from intermediate representations to detect distribution shifts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using standard benchmark datasets for out-of-distribution detection and across different common perception tasks with convolutional neural network architectures. Our scope extends beyond classification, encompassing image-level distribution shift detection for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Our results show that our method's performance is comparable to existing \textit{State-of-the-Art} methods while being computationally faster and lighter than other Bayesian approaches, affirming its practical utility.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 A comparison-based search algorithm lets a user find a target item $t$ in a database by answering queries of the form, ``Which of items $i$ and $j$ is closer to $t$?'' Instead of formulating an explicit query (such as one or several keywords), the user navigates towards the target via a sequence of such (typically noisy) queries. We propose a scale-free probabilistic oracle model called $\gamma$-CKL for such similarity triplets $(i,j;t)$, which generalizes the CKL triplet model proposed in the literature. The generalization affords independent control over the discriminating power of the oracle and the dimension of the feature space containing the items. We develop a search algorithm with provably exponential rate of convergence under the $\gamma$-CKL oracle, thanks to a backtracking strategy that deals with the unavoidable errors in updating the belief region around the target. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm both over the posited oracle and over several real-world triplet datasets. We also report on a comprehensive user study, where human subjects navigate a database of face portraits. 
 ID: 424 | Invariant Causal Prediction with Local Models  
  
 Alexander Mey, Rui M. Castro  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We consider the task of identifying the causal parents of a target variable among a set of candidates from observational data. Our main assumption is that the candidate variables are observed in different environments which may, under certain assumptions, be regarded as interventions on the observed system. We assume a linear relationship between target and candidates, which can be different in each environment with the only restriction that the causal structure is invariant across environments. Within our proposed setting we provide sufficient conditions for identifiability of the causal parents and introduce a practical method called L-ICP ($\textbf{L}$ocalized $\textbf{I}$nvariant $\textbf{Ca}$usal $\textbf{P}$rediction), which is based on a hypothesis test for parent identification using a ratio of minimum and maximum statistics. We then show in a simplified setting that the statistical power of L-ICP converges exponentially fast in the sample size, and finally we analyze the behavior of L-ICP experimentally in more general settings.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 A common type of zero-inflated data has certain true values incorrectly replaced by zeros due to data recording conventions (rare outcomes assumed to be absent) or details of data recording equipment (e.g. artificial zeros in gene expression data). Existing methods for zero-inflated data either fit the observed data likelihood via parametric mixture models that explicitly represent excess zeros, or aim to replace excess zeros by imputed values. If the goal of the analysis relies on knowing true data realizations, a particular challenge with zero-inflated data is identifiability, since it is difficult to correctly determine which observed zeros are real and which are inflated. This paper views zero-inflated data as a general type of missing data problem, where the observability indicator for a potentially censored variable is itself unobserved whenever a zero is recorded. We show that, without additional assumptions, target parameters involving a zero-inflated variable are not identified. However, if a proxy of the missingness indicator is observed, a modification of the effect restoration approach of Kuroki and Pearl allows identification and estimation, given the proxy-indicator relationship is known. If this relationship is unknown, our approach yields a partial identification strategy for sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show that only certain proxy-indicator relationships are compatible with the observed data distribution. We give an analytic bound for this relationship in cases with a categorical outcome, which is sharp in certain models. For more complex cases, sharp numerical bounds may be computed using methods in Duarte et al. [2023]. We illustrate our method via simulation studies and a data application on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). 
 ID: 431 | Normalizing Flows for Conformal Regression  
 [oral]  
 Nicolò Colombo  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Conformal Prediction (CP) algorithms estimate the uncertainty of a prediction model by calibrating its outputs on labeled data. The same calibration scheme usually applies to any model and data without modifications. The obtained prediction intervals are valid by construction but could be inefficient, i.e. unnecessarily big, if the prediction errors are not uniformly distributed over the input space. We present a general scheme to localize the intervals by training the calibration process. The standard prediction error is replaced by an optimized distance metric that depends explicitly on the object attributes. Learning the optimal metric is equivalent to training a Normalizing Flow that acts on the joint distribution of the errors and the inputs. Unlike the Error Re-weighting CP algorithm of Papadopoulos et al. (2008), the framework allows estimating the gap between nominal and empirical conditional validity. The approach is compatible with existing locally-adaptive CP strategies based on re-weighting the calibration samples and applies to any point-prediction model without retraining.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making informed decisions in medicine. However, they are often not representative of the patient population in clinical practice. Observational studies, on the other hand, cover a broader patient population but are prone to various biases. Thus, before using observational data for any downstream task, it is crucial to benchmark its treatment effect estimates against a randomized trial. We propose a novel strategy to benchmark observational studies on a subgroup level. First, we design a statistical test for the null hypothesis that the treatment effects -- conditioned on a subset of relevant features -- differ up to some tolerance value. Our test allows us to estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the maximum bias strength for any subgroup. We validate our lower bound in a real-world setting and show that it leads to conclusions that align with established medical knowledge. 
 ID: 441 | Multi-layer random features and the approximation power of neural networks  
  
 Rustem Takhanov  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 A neural architecture with randomly initialized weights, in the infinite width limit, is equivalent to a Gaussian Random Field whose covariance function is the so-called Neural Network Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP). We prove that a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the NNGP contains only functions that can be approximated by the architecture. To achieve a certain approximation error the required number of neurons in each layer is defined by the RKHS norm of the target function. Moreover, the approximation can be constructed from a supervised dataset by a random multi-layer representation of an input vector, together with training of the last layer's weights. For a 2-layer NN and a domain equal to an $n-1$-dimensional sphere in ${\mathbb R}^n$, we compare the number of neurons required by Barron's theorem and by the multi-layer features construction. We show that if eigenvalues of the integral operator of the NNGP decay slower than $k^{-n-\frac{2}{3}}$ where $k$ is an order of an eigenvalue, then our theorem guarantees a more succinct neural network approximation than Barron's theorem. We also make some computational experiments to verify our theoretical findings. Our experiments show that realistic neural networks easily learn target functions even when both theorems do not give any guarantees. 
 ID: 443 | Amortized Variational Inference: When and Why?  
  
 Charles Margossian, David Blei  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In a probabilistic latent variable model, factorized (or mean-field) variational inference (F-VI) fits a separate parametric distribution for each latent variable. Amortized variational inference (A-VI) instead learns a common inference function, which maps each observation to its corresponding latent variable's approximate posterior. Typically, A-VI is used as a cog in the training of variational autoencoders, however it stands to reason that A-VI could also be used as a general alternative to F-VI. In this paper we study when and why A-VI can be used for approximate Bayesian inference. We derive conditions on a latent variable model which are necessary, sufficient, and verifiable under which A-VI can attain F-VI's optimal solution, thereby closing the amortization gap. We prove these conditions are uniquely verified by simple hierarchical models, a broad class that encompasses many models in machine learning. We then show, on a broader class of models, how to expand the domain of AVI’s inference function to improve its solution, and we provide examples, e.g. hidden Markov models, where the amortization gap cannot be closed. 
 ID: 445 | Neural Active Learning Meets the Partial Monitoring Framework  
  
 Maxime Heuillet, Ola Ahmad, Audrey Durand  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We focus on the online-based active learning (OAL) setting where an agent operates over a stream of observations and trades-off between the costly acquisition of information (labelled observations) and the cost of prediction errors. We propose a novel foundation for OAL tasks based on partial monitoring, a theoretical framework specialized in online learning from partially informative actions. We show that previously studied binary and multi-class OAL tasks are instances of partial monitoring. We expand the real-world potential of OAL by introducing a new class of cost-sensitive OAL tasks. We propose NeuralCBP, the first PM strategy that accounts for predictive uncertainty with deep neural networks. Our extensive empirical evaluation on open source datasets shows that NeuralCBP has competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines on multiple binary, multi-class and cost-sensitive OAL tasks. 
 ID: 446 | No-Regret Learning of Nash Equilibrium for Black-Box Games via Gaussian Processes  
  
 Minbiao Han, Fengxue Zhang, Yuxin Chen  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 This paper investigates the challenge of learning in black-box games, where the underlying utility function is unknown to any of the agents. While there is an extensive body of literature on the theoretical analysis of algorithms for computing the Nash equilibrium with *complete information* about the game, studies on Nash equilibrium in *black-box* games are less common. In this paper, we focus on learning the Nash equilibrium when the only available information about an agent's payoff comes in the form of empirical queries. We provide a no-regret learning algorithm that utilizes Gaussian processes to identify equilibria in such games. Our approach not only ensures a theoretical convergence rate but also demonstrates effectiveness across a variety collection of games through experimental validation.

 Charles K. Assaad, Emilie Devijver, Eric Gaussier, Gregor Goessler, Anouar Meynaoui  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We study the problem of identifiability of the total effect of an intervention from observational time series only given an abstraction of the causal graph of the system. Specifically, we consider two types of abstractions: the extended summary causal graph which conflates all lagged causal relations but distinguishes between lagged and instantaneous relations; and the summary causal graph which does not give any indication about the lag between causal relations. We show that the total effect is always identifiable in extended summary causal graphs and we provide necessary and sufficient graphical conditions for identifiability in summary causal graphs. Furthermore, we provide adjustment sets allowing to estimate the total effect whenever it is identifiable. 
 ID: 454 | Extremely Greedy Equivalence Search  
 [spotlight]  
 Achille Nazaret, David Blei  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The goal of causal discovery is to learn a directed acyclic graph from data. One of the most well-known methods for this problem is Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). GES searches for the graph by incrementally and greedily adding or removing edges to maximize a model selection criterion. It has strong theoretical guarantees on infinite data but can fail in practice on finite data. In this paper, we first identify some of the causes of GES's failure, finding that it can get blocked in local optima, especially in denser graphs. We then propose eXtremely Greedy Equivalent Search (XGES), which involves a new heuristic to improve the search strategy of GES while retaining its theoretical guarantees. In particular, XGES favors deleting edges early in the search over inserting edges, which reduces the possibility of the search ending in local optima. A further contribution of this work is an efficient algorithmic formulation of XGES (and GES). We benchmark XGES on simulated datasets with known ground truth. We find that XGES consistently outperforms GES in recovering the correct graphs, and it is 10 times faster.

 Hailiang Dong, James Amato, Vibhav Giridhar Gogate, Nicholas Ruozzi  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) have attracted substantial research interest in recent years, particularly because of their ability to answer various reasoning queries in polynomial time. In this study, we focus on the distributionally robust learning of continuous TPMs and address the challenge of distribution shift at test time by tackling the adversarial risk minimization problem within the framework of distributionally robust learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that the adversarial risk minimization problem can be efficiently addressed when the model permits exact log-likelihood evaluation and efficient learning on weighted data. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show that our approach achieves significantly higher log-likelihoods on adversarial test sets. Remarkably, we note that the model learned via distributionally robust learning can achieve higher average log-likelihood on the initial uncorrupted test set at times.

 [oral]  
 Manuj Mishra, James Fox, Michael J. Wooldridge  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Causal games are probabilistic graphical models that enable causal queries to be answered in multi-agent settings. They extend causal Bayesian networks by specifying decision and utility variables to represent the agents' degrees of freedom and objectives. In multi-agent settings, whether each agent decides on their policy before or after knowing the causal intervention is important as this affects whether they can respond to the intervention by adapting their policy. Consequently, previous work in causal games imposed chronological constraints on permissible interventions. We relax this by outlining a sound and complete set of primitive causal interventions so the effect of any arbitrarily complex interventional query can be studied in multi-agent settings. We also demonstrate applications to the design of safe AI systems by considering causal mechanism design and commitment. 
 ID: 458 | Partial identification of the maximum mean discrepancy with mismeasured data  
  
 Ron Nafshi, Maggie Makar  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Nonparametric estimates of the distance between two distributions such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are often used in machine learning applications. However, the majority of existing literature assumes that error-free samples from the two distributions of interest are available.We relax this assumption and study the estimation of the MMD under $\epsilon$-contamination, where a possibly non-random $\epsilon$ proportion of one distribution is erroneously grouped with the other. We show that under $\epsilon$-contamination, the typical estimate of the MMD is unreliable. Instead, we study partial identification of the MMD, and characterize sharp upper and lower bounds that contain the true, unknown MMD. We propose a method to estimate these bounds, and show that it gives estimates that converge to the sharpest possible bounds on the MMD as sample size increases, with a convergence rate that is faster than alternative approaches. Using three datasets, we empirically validate that our approach is superior to the alternatives: it gives tight bounds with a low false coverage rate.

 Imad Aouali, Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, David Rohde, Anna Korba  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Off-policy learning (OPL) often involves minimizing a risk estimator based on importance weighting to correct bias from the logging policy used to collect data. However, this method can produce an estimator with a high variance. A common solution is to regularize the importance weights and learn the policy by minimizing an estimator with penalties derived from generalization bounds specific to the estimator. This approach, known as pessimism, has gained recent attention but lacks a unified framework for analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive PAC-Bayesian framework to examine pessimism with regularized importance weighting. We derive a tractable PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that universally applies to common importance weight regularizations, enabling their comparison within a single framework. Our empirical results challenge common understanding, demonstrating the effectiveness of standard IW regularization techniques.

 [oral]  
 Hélène Fargier, Pierre Pomeret-Coquot  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In order to capture a larger range of decision rules, this paper extends the seminal work of [Friedman and Halpern, 1995, Chu and Halpern, 2003, 2004] about Generalized Expected Utility. We introduce the notion of algebraic mass function (and of algebraic Möbius transform) and provide a new algebraic expression for expected utility based on such functions. This utility, that we call "XEU", generalizes Chu and Halpern’s GEU to non-decomposable measures and allows for the representation of several rules that could not be captured up to this point, and noticeably, of the Choquet integral. A representation theorem is provided that shows that only a very weak condition is needed for a rule in order to be representable as a XEU. 
 ID: 465 | DataSP: A Differential All-to-All Shortest Path Algorithm for Learning Costs and Predicting Paths with Context

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Learning latent costs of transitions on graphs from trajectories demonstrations under various contextual features is challenging but useful for path planning. Yet, existing methods either oversimplify cost assumptions or scale poorly with the number of observed trajectories. This paper introduces DataSP, a differentiable all-to-all shortest path algorithm to facilitate learning latent costs from trajectories. It allows to learn from a large number of trajectories in each learning step without additional computation. Complex latent cost functions from contextual features can be represented in the algorithm through a neural network approximation. We further propose a method to sample paths from DataSP in order to reconstruct/mimic observed paths' distributions. We prove that the inferred distribution follows the maximum entropy principle. We show that DataSP outperforms state-of-the-art differentiable combinatorial solver and classical machine learning approaches in predicting paths on graphs.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Minimum-entropy coupling (MEC)---the process of finding a joint distribution with minimum entropy for given marginals---has applications in areas such as causality and steganography. However, existing algorithms are either computationally intractable for large-support distributions or limited to specific distribution types and sensitive to hyperparameter choices. This work addresses these limitations by unifying a prior family of iterative MEC (IMEC) approaches into a generalized partition-based formalism. From this framework, we derive a novel IMEC algorithm called ARIMEC, capable of handling arbitrary discrete distributions, and introduce a method to make IMEC robust to suboptimal hyperparameter settings. These innovations facilitate the application of IMEC to high-throughput steganography with language models, among other settings.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Humans have the capacity to question what we see and to recognize when our vision is unreliable (e.g., when we realize that we are experiencing a visual illusion). Inspired by this capacity, we present MetaCOG: a hierarchical probabilistic model that can be attached to a neural object detector to monitor its outputs and determine their reliability. MetaCOG achieves this by learning a probabilistic model of the object detector’s performance via Bayesian inference—i.e., a meta-cognitive representation of the network’s propensity to hallucinate or miss different object categories. Given a set of video frames processed by an object detector, MetaCOG performs joint inference over the underlying 3D scene and the detector’s performance, grounding inference on a basic assumption of object permanence. Paired with three neural object detectors, we show that MetaCOG accurately recovers each detector’s performance parameters and improves the overall system’s accuracy. We additionally show that MetaCOG is robust to varying levels of error in object detector outputs, showing proof-of-concept for a novel approach to the problem of detecting and correcting errors in vision systems when ground-truth is not available.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We study the Bandits with Knapsacks problem with the aim of designing a learning-augmented online learning algorithm upholding better regret guarantees than the state-of-the-art primal-dual algorithms with worst-case guarantees, under both stochastic and adversarial inputs. In the adversarial case, we obtain better competitive ratios when the input predictions are accurate, while also maintaining worst-case guarantees for imprecise predictions. We introduce two algorithms tailored for the full and bandit feedback settings, respectively. Both algorithms integrate a static prediction with a worst-case no-$\alpha$-regret algorithm. This yields an optimized competitive ratio of $(\pi + (1 -\pi)/\alpha)^{-1}$ in scenarios where the prediction is perfect, and a competitive ratio of $\alpha/(1 - \pi)$ in the case of highly imprecise predictions, where $\pi \in (0,1)$ is chosen by the learner and $\alpha$ is Slater's parameter. We complement this analysis by studying the stochastic setting under full feedback. We provide an algorithm which guarantees a pseudo-regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ with poor predictions, and 0 pseudo-regret with perfect predictions. We also characterize the smoothness of the algorithm.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In conventional regression analysis, predictions are typically represented as point estimates derived from covariates. The Gaussian Process (GP) offer a kernel-based framework that predicts and quantifies associated uncertainties. However, kernel-based methods often underperform ensemble-based decision tree approaches in regression tasks involving tabular and categorical data. Recently, Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) were proposed as a novel feature-learning kernel which strengthens the capabilities of kernel machines. In this study, we harness the power of these RFMs in a probabilistic GP-based approach to enhance uncertainty estimation through feature extraction within kernel methods. We employ this learned kernel for in-depth uncertainty analysis. On tabular datasets, our RFM-based method surpasses other leading uncertainty estimation techniques, including NGBoost and CatBoost-ensemble. Additionally, when assessing out-of-distribution performance, we found that boosting-based methods are surpassed by our RFM-based approach. 
 ID: 487 | Linearly Constrained Gaussian Processes are SkewGPs: application to Monotonic Preference Learning and Desirability  
  
 Alessio Benavoli, Dario Azzimonti  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We show that existing approaches to Linearly Constrained Gaussian Processes (LCGP) for regression, based on imposing constraints on a finite set of operational points, can be seen as Skew Gaussian Processes (SkewGPs). In particular, focusing on inequality constraints and building upon a recent unification of regression, classification, and preference learning through SkewGPs, we extend LCGP to handle monotonic preference learning and desirability, crucial for understanding and predicting human decision making. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model on simulated and real data. 
 ID: 492 | Shedding Light on Large Generative Networks: Estimating Epistemic Uncertainty in Diffusion Models  
  
 Lucas Berry, Axel Brando, David Meger  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Generative diffusion models, notable for their large parameter count (exceeding 100 million) and operation within high-dimensional image spaces, pose significant challenges for traditional uncertainty estimation methods due to computational demands. In this work, we introduce an innovative framework, Diffusion Ensembles for Capturing Uncertainty (DECU), designed for estimating epistemic uncertainty for diffusion models. The DECU framework introduces a novel method that efficiently trains ensembles of conditional diffusion models by incorporating a static set of pre-trained parameters, drastically reducing the computational burden and the number of parameters that require training. Additionally, DECU employs Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) to accurately measure epistemic uncertainty by evaluating the mutual information between model outputs and weights in high-dimensional spaces. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through experiments on the ImageNet dataset, highlighting its capability to capture epistemic uncertainty, specifically in under-sampled image classes.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Causal inference in hybrid domains, characterized by a mixture of discrete and continuous variables, presents a formidable challenge. We take a step towards this direction and propose \textbf{Ch}aracteristic \textbf{I}nterventional Sum-Product Network ($\chi$SPN) that is capable of estimating interventional distributions in presence of random variables drawn from mixed distributions. $\chi$SPN uses characteristic functions in the leaves of an interventional SPN (iSPN) thereby providing a unified view for discrete and continuous random variables through the Fourier–Stieltjes transform of the probability measures. A neural network is used to estimate the parameters of the learned iSPN using the intervened data. Our experiments on 3 synthetic heterogeneous datasets suggest that $\chi$SPN can effectively capture the interventional distributions for both discrete and continuous variables while being expressive and causally adequate. We also show that $\chi$SPN generalize to multiple interventions while being trained only on a single intervention data.

  Abstract      
 Decision trees are a popular tool in machine learning and yield easy-to-understand models. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for learning a decision tree classifier, with different techniques working well for data from different domains. In this work, we develop approaches to design decision tree learning algorithms given repeated access to data from the same domain. We propose novel parameterized classes of node splitting criteria in top-down algorithms, which interpolate between popularly used entropy and Gini impurity based criteria, and provide theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed to learn the splitting function appropriate for the data at hand. We also study the sample complexity of tuning prior parameters in Bayesian decision tree learning, and extend our results to decision tree regression. We further consider the problem of tuning hyperparameters in pruning the decision tree for classical pruning algorithms including min-cost complexity pruning. We also study the interpretability of the learned decision trees and introduce a data-driven approach for optimizing the explainability versus accuracy trade-off using decision trees. Finally, we demonstrate the significance of our approach on real world datasets by learning data-specific decision trees which are simultaneously more accurate and interpretable.

  Abstract      
 Restless multi-arm bandits (RMABs) are a model for sequentially allocating a limited number of resources to agents modeled as Markov Decision Processes. RMABs have applications in cellular networks, anti-poaching, and in particular, healthcare. For such high-stakes use cases, allocations are often required to treat different groups of agents (e.g., defined by sensitive attributes) fairly. In addition to the fairness challenge, agents' transition probabilities are often unknown and need to be learned in real-world problems. Thus, group fairness in RMABs requires us to simultaneously learn transition probabilities and how much budget we allocate to each group. Overcoming this key challenge ignored by previous work, we develop a decision-focused-learning pipeline to solve equitable RMABs, using a novel budget allocation algorithm to prevent disparity between groups. Our results on both synthetic and real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that incorporating fair planning into the learning step greatly improves equity with little sacrifice in utility.

  Abstract      
 Multi-armed bandits (MAB) and causal MABs (CMAB) are established frameworks for decision-making problems. The majority of prior work typically studies and solves individual MAB and CMAB in isolation for a given problem and associated data. However, decision-makers are often faced with multiple related problems and multi-scale observations where joint formulations are needed in order to efficiently exploit the problem structures and data dependencies. Transfer learning for CMABs addresses the situation where models are defined on identical variables, although causal connections may differ. In this work, we extend transfer learning to setups involving CMABs defined on potentially different variables, with varying degrees of granularity, and related via an abstraction map. Formally, we introduce the problem of causally abstracted MABs (CAMABs) by relying on the theory of causal abstraction in order to express a rigorous abstraction map. We propose algorithms to learn in a CAMAB, and study their regret. We illustrate the limitations and the strengths of our algorithms on a real-world scenario related to online advertising. 
 ID: 501 | Sample Average Approximation for Black-Box Variational Inference  
  
 Javier Burroni, Justin Domke, Daniel Sheldon  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Black-box variational inference (BBVI) is a general-purpose approximate inference approach that converts inference to a stochastic optimization problem. However, the difficulty of solving the BBVI optimization problem reliably and robustly using stochastic gradient methods has limited its applicability. We present a novel optimization approach for BBVI using the sample average approximation (SAA). SAA converts stochastic problems to deterministic ones by optimizing over a fixed random sample, which enables optimization tools such as quasi-Newton methods and line search that bypass the difficulties faced by stochastic gradient methods. We design an approach called "SAA for VI" that solves a sequence of SAA problems with increasing sample sizes to reliably and robustly solve BBVI problems without problem-specific tuning. We focus on quasi-Newton methods, which are well suited to problems with up to hundreds of latent variables. Our experiments show that SAA for VI simplifies the VI problem and achieves faster performance than existing methods. 
 ID: 503 | Equilibrium Computation in Multidimensional Congestion Games: CSP and Learning Dynamics Approaches  
  
 Mohammad T. Irfan, Hau Chan, Jared Soundy  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We present algorithms of two flavors—one rooted in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and the other in learning dynamics—to compute pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in k-dimensional congestion games (k-DCGs) and their variants. The two algorithmic approaches are driven by whether or not a PSNE is guaranteed to exist. We first show that deciding the existence of a PSNE in a k-DCG is NP-complete even when players have binary and unit demand vectors. For general cost functions (potentially non-monotonic), we devise a new CSP-inspired algorithmic framework for PSNE computation, leading to algorithms that run in polynomial time under certain assumptions while offering exponential savings over standard CSP algorithms. We further refine these algorithms for variants of k-DCGs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this new CSP framework for hard, non-monotonic k-DCGs. We then provide learning dynamics-based PSNE computation algorithms for linear and exponential cost functions. These algorithms run in polynomial time under certain assumptions. For general cost, we give a learning dynamics algorithm for an (α, β)-approximate PSNE (for certain α and β). Lastly, we also devise polynomial-time algorithms for structured demands and cost functions.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Domain adaptation aims to use training data from one or multiple source domains to learn a hypothesis that can be generalized to a different, but related, target domain. As such, having a reliable measure for evaluating the discrepancy of both marginal and conditional distributions is crucial. We introduce Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence to the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The CS divergence offers a theoretically tighter generalization error bound than the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence. This holds for the general case of supervised learning, including multi-class classification and regression. Furthermore, we illustrate that the CS divergence enables a simple estimator on the discrepancy of both marginal and conditional distributions between source and target domains in the representation space, without requiring any distributional assumptions. We provide multiple examples to illustrate how the CS divergence can be conveniently used in both distance metric- or adversarial training-based UDA frameworks, resulting in compelling performance. The code of our paper is available at \url{https://github.com/ywzcode/CS-adv}.

 Filippo Valdettaro, Aldo A. Faisal  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We address the challenge of quantifying Bayesian uncertainty and incorporating it in offline use cases of finite-state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with unknown dynamics. Our approach provides a principled method to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and a novel technique to find policies that optimise Bayesian posterior expected value without relying on strong assumptions about the MDP’s posterior distribution. First, we utilise standard Bayesian reinforcement learning methods to capture the posterior uncertainty in MDP parameters based on available data. We then analytically compute the first two moments of the return distribution across posterior samples and apply the law of total variance to disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. To find policies that maximise posterior expected value, we leverage the closed-form expression for value as a function of policy. This allows us to propose a stochastic gradient-based approach for solving the problem. We illustrate the uncertainty quantification and Bayesian posterior value optimisation performance of our agent in simple, interpretable gridworlds and validate it through ground-truth evaluations on synthetic MDPs. Finally, we highlight the real-world impact and computational scalability of our method by applying it to the AI Clinician problem, which recommends treatment for patients in intensive care units and has emerged as a key use case of finite-state MDPs with offline data. We discuss the challenges that arise with Bayesian modelling of larger scale MDPs while demonstrating the potential to apply our methods rooted in Bayesian decision theory into the real world. We make our code available at https://github.com/filippovaldettaro/finite-state-mdps. 
 ID: 511 | A Graph Theoretic Approach for Preference Learning with Feature Information  
 [oral]  
 Aadirupa Saha, Arun Rajkumar  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We consider the problem of ranking a set of $n$ items given a sample of their pairwise preferences. It is well known from the classical results of sorting literature that without any further assumption, one requires a sample size of $\Omega(n \log n)$ with active selection of pairs whereas, for a random set pairwise preferences the bound could be as bad as $\Omega(n^2)$. However, what if the learner is exposed to additional knowledge of the items features and their pairwise preferences are known to be modelled in terms of their feature similarities -- can these bounds be improved? In particular, we introduce a new probabilistic preference model, called feature-Bradley-Terry-Luce (f-BTL) for the purpose, and present a new least squares based algorithm, fBTL-LS, which requires a sample complexity much lesser than $O(n\log n)$ random pairs to obtain a `good' ranking. The sample complexity of our proposed algorithms depends on the degree of feature correlation of the items that makes use of tools from classical graph matching theory, shedding light on the true complexity of the problem -- this was not possible before with existing matrix completion based tools. We also prove tightness of our results showing a matching information theoretic lower bound for the problem. Our theoretical results are corroborated with extensive experimental evaluations on varying datasets.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We study learning adversarial Markov decision process (MDP) in the episodic setting under the constraint of differential privacy (DP). This is motivated by the widespread applications of reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary and even adversarial scenarios, where protecting users' sensitive information is vital. We first propose two efficient frameworks for adversarial MDPs, spanning full-information and bandit settings. Within each framework, we consider both Joint DP (JDP), where a central agent is trusted to protect the sensitive data, and Local DP (LDP), where the information is protected directly on the user side. Then, we design novel privacy mechanisms to privatize the stochastic transition and adversarial losses. By instantiating such privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, we obtain near-optimal regret guarantees for both frameworks. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms to tackle the challenge of private learning in adversarial MDPs. 
 ID: 525 | Unsupervised Feature Selection towards Pattern Discrimination Power  
  
 Wangduk Seo, Jaesung Lee  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The goal of unsupervised feature selection is to identify a feature subset based on the intrinsic characteristics of a given dataset without user-guided information such as class variables. To achieve this, score functions based on information measures can be used to identify essential features. The major research direction of conventional information-theoretic unsupervised feature selection is to minimize the entropy of the final feature subset. Although the opposite way, i.e., maximization of the joint entropy, can also lead to novel insights, studies in this direction are rare. For example, in the field of information retrieval, selected features that maximize the joint entropy of a feature subset can be effective discriminators for reaching the target tuple in the database. Thus, in this work, we first demonstrate how two feature subsets, each obtained by minimizing/maximizing the joint entropy, respectively, are different based on a toy dataset. By comparing these two feature subsets, we show that the maximization of the joint entropy enhances the pattern discrimination power of the feature subset. Then, we derive a score function by remedying joint entropy calculation; high-dimensional joint entropy calculation is circumvented by using the low-order approximation. The experimental results on 30 public datasets indicate that the proposed method yields superior performance in terms of pattern discrimination power-related measures.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Structural Entropy (SE) measures the structural information contained in a graph. Minimizing or maximizing SE helps to reveal or obscure the intrinsic structural patterns underlying graphs in an interpretable manner, finding applications in various tasks driven by networked data. However, SE ignores the heterogeneity inherent in the graph relations, which is ubiquitous in modern networks. In this work, we extend SE to consider heterogeneous relations and propose the first metric for multi-relational graph structural information, namely, Multi-relational Structural Entropy (MrSE). To this end, we first cast SE through the novel lens of the stationary distribution from random surfing, which readily extends to multi-relational networks by considering the choices of both nodes and relation types simultaneously at each step. The resulting MrSE is then optimized by a new greedy algorithm to reveal the essential structures within a multi-relational network. Experimental results highlight that the proposed MrSE offers a more insightful interpretation of the structure of multi-relational graphs compared to SE. Additionally, it enhances the performance of two tasks that involve real-world multi-relational graphs, including node clustering and social event detection.

  Abstract      
 Gradient Descent (GD) has been proven effective in solving various matrix factorization problems. However, its optimization behavior with large initial values remains less understood. To address this gap, this paper presents a novel theoretical framework for examining the convergence trajectory of GD with a large initialization. The framework is grounded in signal-to-noise ratio concepts and inductive arguments. The results uncover an implicit incremental learning phenomenon in GD and offer a deeper understanding of its performance in large initialization scenarios.

  Abstract      
 Bayesian networks are a popular class of directed probabilistic graphical models that allow for closed-form learning of the local parameters if complete data are available. However, learning the parameters is challenging when the data are sparse, incomplete, and uncertain. In this work, we present an approach to this problem based on credal networks, a generalization of Bayesian networks based on set-valued local parameters. We derive an algorithm to learn such set-valued parameters from data using qualitative knowledge in the form of monotonic influence statements. Our empirical evaluation shows that using qualitative knowledge reduces uncertainty about the parameters without significant loss in accuracy.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Reweighting a distribution to minimize a distance to a target distribution is a powerful and flexible strategy for estimating a wide range of causal effects, but can be challenging in practice because optimal weights typically depend on knowledge of the underlying data generating process. In this paper, we focus on design-based weights, which do not incorporate outcome information; prominent examples include prospective cohort studies, survey weighting, and the weighting portion of augmented weighting estimators. In such applications, we explore the central role of representation learning in finding desirable weights in practice. Unlike the common approach of assuming a well-specified representation, we highlight the error due to the choice of a representation and outline a general framework for finding suitable representations that minimize this error. Building on recent work that combines balancing weights and neural networks, we propose an end-to-end estimation procedure that learns a flexible representation, while retaining promising theoretical properties. We show that this approach is competitive in a range of common causal inference tasks.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Data assimilation (DA) methods use priors arising from differential equations to robustly interpolate and extrapolate data. Popular techniques such as ensemble methods that handle high-dimensional, nonlinear PDE priors focus mostly on state estimation, however can have difficulty learning the parameters accurately. On the other hand, machine learning based approaches can naturally learn the state and parameters, but their applicability can be limited, or produce uncertainties that are hard to interpret. Inspired by the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method in spatial statistics, we propose an alternative approach to DA based on iteratively linearising the dynamical model. This produces a Gaussian Markov random field at each iteration, enabling one to use INLA to infer the state and parameters. Our approach can be used for arbitrary nonlinear systems, while retaining interpretability, and is furthermore demonstrated to outperform existing methods on the DA task. By providing a more nuanced approach to handling nonlinear PDE priors, our methodology offers improved accuracy and robustness in predictions, especially where data sparsity is prevalent.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The need for modelling causal knowledge at different levels of granularity arises in several settings. Causal Abstraction provides a framework for formalizing this problem by relating two Structural Causal Models at different levels of detail. Despite increasing interest in applying causal abstraction, e.g. in the interpretability of large machine learning models, the graphical and parametrical conditions under which a causal model can abstract another are not known. Furthermore, learning causal abstractions from data is still an open problem. In this work, we tackle both issues for linear causal models with linear abstraction functions. First, we characterize how the low-level coefficients and the abstraction function determine the high-level coefficients and how the high-level model constrains the causal ordering of low-level variables. Then, we apply our theoretical results to learn high-level and low-level causal models and their abstraction function from observational data. In particular, we introduce Abs-LiNGAM, a method that leverages the constraints induced by the learned high-level model and the abstraction function to speedup the recovery of the larger low-level model, under the assumption of non-Gaussian noise terms. In simulated settings, we show the effectiveness of learning causal abstractions from data and the potential of our method in improving scalability of causal discovery.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Despite the impressive capability of large language models (LLMs), knowing when to trust their generations remains an open challenge. The recent literature on uncertainty quantification of natural language generation (NLG) utilizes a conventional natural language inference (NLI) classifier to measure the semantic dispersion of LLMs responses. These studies employ logits of NLI classifier for semantic clustering to estimate uncertainty. However, logits represent the probability of the predicted class and barely contain feature information for potential clustering. Alternatively, CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) performs impressively in extracting image-text pair features and measuring their similarity. To extend its usability, we propose Contrastive Semantic Similarity, the CLIP-based feature extraction module to obtain similarity features for measuring uncertainty for text pairs. We apply this method to selective NLG, which detects and rejects unreliable generations for better trustworthiness of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments with three LLMs on several benchmark question-answering datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Results show that our proposed method performs better in estimating reliable responses of LLMs than comparable baselines.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In many settings, such as scientific inference, optimization, and transfer learning, the learner has a well-defined objective, which can be treated as estimation of a target parameter, and no intrinsic interest in characterizing the entire data-generating process. Usually, the learner must also contend with additional sources of uncertainty or variables --- with nuisance parameters. Bayesian active learning, or sequential optimal experimental design, can straightforwardly accommodate the presence of nuisance parameters, and so is a natural active learning framework for such problems. However, the introduction of nuisance parameters can lead to bias in the Bayesian learner's estimate of the target parameters, a phenomenon we refer to as negative interference. We characterize the threat of negative interference and how it fundamentally changes the nature of the Bayesian active learner's task. We show that the extent of negative interference can be extremely large, and that accurate estimation of the nuisance parameters is critical to reducing it. The Bayesian active learner is confronted with a dilemma: whether to spend a finite acquisition budget in pursuit of estimation of the target or of the nuisance parameters. Our setting encompasses Bayesian transfer learning as a special case, and our results shed light on the phenomenon of negative transfer between learning environments.

  Abstract      
 Learning to predict rare medical events is difficult due to the inherent lack of signal in highly imbalanced datasets. Yet, oftentimes we also have access to surrogate or related outcomes that we believe share etiology or underlying risk factors with the event of interest. In this work, we propose the use of two variants of a well-known approach, regularized multi-label learning (MLL), that we hypothesize are uniquely suited to leverage this similarity and improve model performance in rare event settings. Whereas most analyses of MLL emphasize improved performance across all event types, our analyses quantify benefits to rare event prediction offered by our approach when a more common, related event is available to enhance learning. We begin by deriving asymptotic properties and providing theoretical insight into the convergence rates of our proposed estimators. We then provide simulation results highlighting how characteristics of the data generating process, including the event similarity and event rate, affect our proposed models' performance. We conclude by showing real-world benefit of our approach in two clinical settings: prediction of rare cardiovascular morbidities in the setting of preeclampsia; and early prediction of autism from the electronic health record.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The paradigm of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to specify the reward function of an agent purely from its actions and is critical for value alignment and AI safety. While IRL is successful in practice, theoretical guarantees remain nascent. Motivated by the need for IRL in large action spaces with limited data, we consider as a first step the problem of learning from a single sequence of actions (i.e., a demonstration) of a stochastic linear bandit algorithm. When the demonstrator employs the Phased Elimination algorithm, we develop a simple inverse learning procedure that estimates the linear reward function consistently in the time horizon with just a \textit{single} demonstration. In particular, we show that our inverse learner approximates the true reward parameter within a error of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{\omega - 1}{2\omega }})$ (where $T$ is the length of the demonstrator's trajectory and $\omega$ is a constant that depends on the geometry of the action set). We complement this result with an information-theoretic lower bound for any inverse learning procedure. We corroborate our theoretical results with simulations on synthetic data and a demonstration constructed from the MovieLens dataset.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Causal discovery is crucial for causal inference in observational studies, as it can enable the identification of *valid adjustment sets* (VAS) for unbiased effect estimation. However, global causal discovery is notoriously hard in the nonparametric setting, with exponential time and sample complexity in the worst case. To address this, we propose *local discovery by partitioning* (LDP): a local causal discovery method that is tailored for downstream inference tasks without requiring parametric and pretreatment assumptions. LDP is a constraint-based procedure that returns a VAS for an exposure-outcome pair under latent confounding, given sufficient conditions. The total number of independence tests performed is worst-case quadratic with respect to the cardinality of the variable set. Asymptotic theoretical guarantees are numerically validated on synthetic graphs. Adjustment sets from LDP yield less biased and more precise average treatment effect estimates than baseline discovery algorithms, with LDP outperforming on confounder recall, runtime, and test count for VAS discovery. Notably, LDP ran at least $1300\times$ faster than baselines on a benchmark.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Many decision processes in artificial intelligence and operations research are modeled by parametric optimization problems whose defining parameters are unknown and must be inferred from observable data. The Predict-Then-Optimize (PtO) paradigm in machine learning aims to maximize downstream decision quality by training the parametric inference model end-to-end with the subsequent constrained optimization. This requires backpropagation through the optimization problem using approximation techniques specific to the problem's form, especially for nondifferentiable linear and mixed-integer programs. This paper extends the PtO methodology to optimization problems with nondifferentiable Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) objectives, known for their ability to ensure properties of fairness and robustness in decision models. Through a collection of training techniques and proposed application settings, it shows how optimization of OWA functions can be effectively integrated with parametric prediction for fair and robust optimization under uncertainty.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Despite the success of current segmentation models powered by the transformer, the camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) task remains a challenge due to the similarity between the target and the background. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the local-feature-aware transformer ($\alpha$-Former), inspired by how humans find the camouflaged instance in a given photograph. We use traditional computer vision descriptors to simulate how humans find the unnatural boundary in a given photograph. Then, the information extracted by traditional descriptors can be employed as prior knowledge to enhance the neural network's performance. Moreover, due to the non-learnable characteristics of traditional descriptors, we designed a learnable binary filter to simulate the traditional descriptors. In order to aggregate the information from the backbone and binary filter, we introduce an adapter to merge local features into the transformer framework. Additionally, we introduce an edge-aware feature fusion module to improve boundary results in the segmentation model. Using the proposed transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, our $\alpha$-Former surpasses state-of-the-art performance on the COD10K and NC4K datasets.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Models for human choice prediction in preference learning and perception science often use binary response data, requiring many samples to accurately learn latent utilities or perceptual intensities. The response time (RT) to make each choice captures additional information about the decision process, but existing models incorporating RTs for choice prediction do so in a fully parametric way or over discrete inputs. At the same time, state-of-the-art Gaussian process (GP) models of perception and preferences operate on choices only, ignoring RTs. We propose two approaches for incorporating RTs into GP preference and perception models. The first is based on stacking GP models, and the second uses a novel differentiable approximation to the likelihood of the diffusion decision model (DDM), the de-facto standard model for choice RTs. Our RT-choice GPs enable better latent value estimation and held-out choice prediction relative to baselines, which we demonstrate on three real-world multivariate datasets covering both human psychophysics and preference learning.

 Deep, overparameterized regression models are notorious for their tendency to overfit. This problem is exacerbated in heteroskedastic models, which predict both mean and residual noise for each data point. At one extreme, these models fit all training data perfectly, eliminating residual noise entirely; at the other, they overfit the residual noise while predicting a constant, uninformative mean. We observe a lack of middle ground, suggesting a phase transition dependent on model regularization strength. Empirical verification supports this conjecture by fitting numerous models with varying mean and variance regularization. To explain the transition, we develop a theoretical framework based on a statistical field theory, yielding qualitative agreement with experiments. As a practical consequence, our analysis simplifies hyperparameter tuning from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional search, substantially reducing the computational burden. Experiments on diverse datasets, including UCI datasets and the large-scale ClimSim climate dataset, demonstrate significantly improved performance in various calibration tasks.

  Abstract      
 We analyze a sparse PCA algorithm for incomplete and noisy data without any specific model assumption on the data missing scheme. We utilize a graphical approach to characterize general missing patterns, which enables us to analyze the effect of structural properties of missing patterns on the solvability of sparse PCA problem. The sparse PCA method we focus on is a semidefinite relaxation of the $\ell_1$-regularized PCA problem. We provide theoretical justification that the support of the sparse leading eigenvector can be recovered with high probability using the algorithm, under certain conditions. The conditions involve the spectral gap between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the true data matrix, the magnitude of the noise, and the structural properties of the missing pattern. The concepts of algebraic connectivity and irregularity are used to describe the properties in a graphical way. We empirically justify our theorem with synthetic data analysis. We show that the SDP algorithm outperforms other sparse PCA approaches especially when the observation pattern has good structural properties. As a by-product of our analysis, we provide two theorems to handle general missing schemes, which can be applied to other problems related to incomplete data matrices.

  Abstract      
 Causal inference is made challenging by confounding, selection bias, and other complications. A common approach to addressing these difficulties is the inclusion of auxiliary data on the superpopulation of interest. Such data may measure a different set of variables, or be obtained under different experimental conditions than the primary dataset. Analysis based on multiple datasets must carefully account for similarities between datasets, while appropriately accounting for differences. In addition, selection of experimental units into different datasets may be systematic; similar difficulties are encountered in missing data problems. Existing methods for combining datasets either do not consider this issue, or assume simple selection mechanisms. In this paper, we provide a general approach, based on graphical causal models, for causal inference from data on the same superpopulation that is obtained under different experimental conditions. Our framework allows both arbitrary unobserved confounding, and arbitrary selection processes into different experimental regimes in our data. We describe how systematic selection processes may be organized into a hierarchy similar to censoring processes in missing data: selected completely at random (SCAR), selected at random (SAR), and selected not at random (SNAR). In addition, we provide a general identification algorithm for interventional distributions in this setting.

  Abstract      
 Differential privacy mechanisms such as the Gaussian or Laplace mechanism have been widely used in data analytics for preserving individual privacy. However, they are mostly designed for continuous outputs and are unsuitable for scenarios where discrete values are necessary. Although various quantization mechanisms were proposed recently to generate discrete outputs under differential privacy, the outcomes are either biased or have an inferior accuracy-privacy trade-off. In this paper, we propose a family of quantization mechanisms that is unbiased and differentially private. It has a high degree of freedom and we show that some existing mechanisms can be considered as special cases of ours. To find the optimal mechanism, we formulate a linear optimization that can be solved efficiently using linear programming tools. Experiments show that our proposed mechanism can attain a better privacy-accuracy trade-off compared to baselines. 
 ID: 582 | Decision-Focused Evaluation of Worst-Case Distribution Shift

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Recent studies have shown that performance on downstream optimization tasks often diverges from standard accuracy-based losses, highlighting that the loss function of a predictive model should align with the decision task of the downstream optimizer. Despite this observation, no work— to our knowledge—has yet examined the impact of this divergence for distribution shift. In this paper, we demonstrate that worst-case distribution shifts identified by traditional average accuracy-based metrics fundamentally differ from those for the downstream decision task at hand. We introduce a novel framework that employs a hierarchical model structure to identify worst-case distribution shifts in predictive resource allocation settings. This task is more difficult than in standard distribution shift settings because of combinatorial interactions, where decisions depend on the joint presence of individuals in the allocation task. We show that the problem can be reformulated as a submodular optimization problem, enabling efficient approximations, to capture shifts both within and across instances of the optimization problem.

  Abstract      
 Many populations defined by illegal or stigmatized behavior are difficult to sample using conventional survey methodology. Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a participant referral process frequently employed in this context to collect information. This sampling methodology can be modeled as a stochastic process that explores the graph of a social network, generating a partially observed subgraph between study participants. The methods currently used to impute the missing edges in this subgraph exhibit biased downstream estimation. We leverage auxiliary participant information and concepts from indirect inference to ameliorate these issues and improve estimation of the hidden population size. These advances result in smaller bias and higher precision in the estimation of the study participant arrival rate, the sample subgraph, and the population size. Lastly, we use our method to estimate the number of People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) in the Kohtla-Jarve region of Estonia.

  Abstract      
 Significant progression has been made in active learning algorithms for graph networks in various tasks. However real-world applications frequently involve incomplete graphs with missing links, which pose the challenge that existing approaches might not adequately address. This paper presents an active learning approach tailored specifically for handling incomplete graphs, termed ALIN. Our algorithm employs graph neural networks (GNN) to generate node embeddings and calculates losses for both node classification and link prediction tasks. The losses are combined with appropriate weights and iteratively updating the GNN, ALIN efficiently queries nodes in batches, thereby achieving a balance between training feedbacks and resource utilization. Our empirical experiments have shown ALIN can surpass state-of-the-art baselines on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Coauthor-CS datasets.

  Abstract      
 Data Augmentation (DA) has become a widely adopted strategy for addressing data scarcity in numerous NLP tasks, especially in scenarios with limited resources or imbalanced classes. However, many existing augmentation techniques rely on randomness or additional resources, presenting challenges in both performance and practical implementation. Furthermore, there is a lack of exploration into what constitutes effective augmentation. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing DA methods across a comprehensive range of text-classification benchmarks. The empirical analysis highlights that the most significant change resulting from augmentation is observed in the data variance. This observation inspires the proposed approach, termed Mask-for-Data Augmentation (M4DA), which strategically masks tokens from original samples for augmentation. Specifically, M4DA consists of a Variance-Oriented Masker Module (VMM), which ensures an increase in data variances, and a Complexity-Enhanced Selection Module (CSM), designed to select the augmented sample with the highest semantic complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is empirically validated across various text-classification benchmarks, including scenarios with limited or full resources and imbalanced classes. Experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements over state-of-the-arts. 
 ID: 597 | On Convergence of Federated Averaging Langevin Dynamics  
  
 Wei Deng, Qian Zhang, Yian Ma, Zhao Song, Guang Lin  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We propose a federated averaging Langevin algorithm (FA-LD) for uncertainty quantification and mean predictions with distributed clients. In particular, we generalize beyond normal posterior distributions and consider a general class of models. We develop theoretical guarantees for FA-LD for strongly log-concave distributions with non-i.i.d data and study how the injected noise and the stochastic-gradient noise, the heterogeneity of data, and the varying learning rates affect the convergence. Such an analysis sheds light on the optimal choice of local updates to minimize the communication cost. Important to our approach is that the communication efficiency does not deteriorate with the injected noise in the Langevin algorithms. In addition, we examine in our FA-LD algorithm both independent and correlated noise used over different clients. We observe that there is a trade-off between the pairs among communication, accuracy, and data privacy. As local devices may become inactive in federated networks, we also show convergence results based on different averaging schemes where only partial device updates are available. In such a case, we discover an additional bias that does not decay to zero.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In data-intensive applications, graphs serve as foundational structures across various domains. However, the increasing size of datasets poses significant challenges to performing downstream tasks. To address this problem, techniques such as graph coarsening, condensation, and summarization have been developed to create a coarsened graph while preserving important properties of the original graph by considering both the graph matrix and the feature or attribute matrix of the original graph as inputs. However, existing graph coarsening techniques often neglect the label information during the coarsening process, which can result in a lower-quality coarsened graph and limit its suitability for downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Label-Aware Graph Coarsening (LAGC) algorithm, a semi-supervised approach that incorporates the graph matrix, feature matrix, and some of the node label information to learn a coarsened graph. Our proposed formulation is a non-convex optimization problem that is efficiently solved using block successive upper bound minimization(BSUM) technique, and it is provably convergent. Our extensive results demonstrate that the LAGC algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method by a significant margin.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a widely-used online planning strategy that effectively combines Monte-Carlo sampling with forward tree search to make optimal decisions in various real-world scenarios. Its success hinges on the application of the Upper Confidence bound for Trees (UCT) algorithm, an extension of the Upper Confidence bound (UCB) method used in multi-arm bandits. However, theoretical investigations of UCT have been found incomplete due to an error in the estimated "logarithmic" bonus term used for action selection in the tree. This issue was addressed by introducing a "polynomial" exploration bonus, which effectively balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off. However, most theoretical studies have focused on deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), neglecting stochastic settings. In this paper, we introduce Stochastic-Power-UCT, an MCTS algorithm explicitly designed for stochastic MDPs using power mean as the value estimator. We conduct a comprehensive study of the polynomial convergence assurance for selecting the optimal action and estimating the value at the root node within our methodology. Our findings demonstrate that Stochastic-Power-UCT shares the same convergence rate as UCT, with UCT being a special case of Stochastic-Power-UCT. Furthermore, we validate our theoretical results through empirical assessments across diverse stochastic MDP environments, providing empirical evidence to support our method's theoretical claims

  Abstract      
 Many sequential decision problems involve optimizing one objective function while imposing constraints on other objectives. Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (C-POMDP) model this case with transition uncertainty and partial observability. In this work, we first show that C-POMDPs violate the optimal substructure property over successive decision steps and thus may exhibit behaviors that are undesirable for some (e.g., safety critical) applications. Additionally, online re-planning in C-POMDPs is often ineffective due to the inconsistency resulting from this violation. To address these drawbacks, we introduce the Recursively-Constrained POMDP (RC-POMDP), which imposes additional history-dependent cost constraints on the C-POMDP. We show that, unlike C-POMDPs, RC-POMDPs always have deterministic optimal policies and that optimal policies obey Bellman's principle of optimality. We also present a point-based dynamic programming algorithm for RC-POMDPs. Evaluations on benchmark problems demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm and show that policies for RC-POMDPs produce more desirable behaviors than policies for C-POMDPs.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We explore the use of Large Language Model (LLM-based) chatbots to power recommender systems. We observe that the chatbots respond poorly when they encounter under-specified requests (e.g., they make incorrect assumptions, hedge with a long response, or refuse to answer). We conjecture that such miscalibrated response tendencies (i.e., conversational priors) can be attributed to LLM fine-tuning by annotators --- single-turn annotations may not capture multi-turn conversation utility, and the annotators' preferences may not even be representative of users interacting with a recommender system. We first analyze public LLM chat logs to conclude that query under-specification is common. Next, we study synthetic recommendation problems with known but latent item utilities, and frame them as Partially Observed Decision Processes (PODP). We find that pre-trained LLMs can be sub-optimal for PODPs and derive better policies that clarify under-specified queries when appropriate. Then, we re-calibrate LLMs by prompting them with learned control messages to approximate the improved policy. Finally, we show empirically that our lightweight learning approach effectively uses logged conversation data to re-calibrate the response strategies of LLM-based chatbots for recommendation tasks.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In the context of online interactive machine learning with combinatorial objectives, we extend purely submodular prior work to more general non-submodular objectives. This includes: (1) those that are additively decomposable into a sum of two terms (a monotone submodular and monotone supermodular term, known as a BP decomposition); and (2) those that are only weakly submodular. In both cases, this allows representing not only competitive (submodular) but also complementary (supermodular) relationships between objects, enhancing this setting to a broader range of applications (e.g., movie recommendations, medical treatments, etc.) where this is beneficial. In the two-term case, moreover, we study not only the more typical monolithic feedback approach but also a novel framework where feedback is available separately for each term. With real-world practicality and scalability in mind, we integrate \Nystrom{} sketching techniques to significantly improve the computational complexity, including for the purely submodular case. In the Gaussian process contextual bandits setting, we show sub-linear theoretical regret bounds in all cases. We also empirically show good applicability to recommendation systems and data subset selection.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is an essential class of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Its inherent NP-hardness has fostered considerable efforts towards the development of heuristic strategies. An emerging approach involves leveraging data-driven methods to automatically learn these heuristics. For example, using deep (reinforcement) learning to recurrently reoptimize an initial solution with Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) has demonstrated exceptional performance across numerous applications. A pivotal challenge within LNS lies in identifying an optimal subset of variables for reoptimization at each stage. Existing methods typically learn a policy to select a subset, either by maintaining a fixed cardinality or by decomposing the subset into independent binary decisions for each variable. However, such strategies overlook the modeling of LNS’s sequential processes and fail to explore the correlations inherent in variable selection. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce ILP-FORMER, an innovative model that reimagines policy learning as a sequence-to-multi-label classification (MLC) problem. Our approach uniquely integrates a causal transformer encoder to capture the sequential nature of LNS. Additionally, we employ an MLC decoder with contrastive learning to exploit the correlations in variable selection. Our extensive experiments confirm that ILP-FORMER delivers state-of-the-art anytime performance on several ILP benchmarks. Furthermore, ILP-FORMER exhibits impressive generalization capabilities when dealing with larger problem instances.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 NLP tasks such as language models or document classification involve classification problems with thousands of classes. In these situations, it is difficult to get high predictive accuracy and the resulting model can be huge in number of parameters and inference time. A recent, successful approach is the softmax tree (ST): a decision tree having sparse hyperplane splits at the decision nodes (which make hard, not soft, decisions) and small softmax classifiers at the leaves. Inference here is very fast because only a small subset of class probabilities need to be computed, yet the model is quite accurate. However, a significant drawback is that it assumes a complete tree, whose size grows exponentially with depth. We propose a new algorithm to train a ST of arbitrary structure. The tree structure itself is learned optimally by interleaving steps that grow the structure with steps that optimize the parameters of the current structure. This makes it possible to learn STs that can grow much deeper but in an irregular way, adapting to the data distribution. The resulting STs improve considerably the predictive accuracy while reducing the model size and inference time even further, as demonstrated in datasets with thousands of classes. In addition, they are interpretable to some extent. 
 ID: 626 | Optimizing Language Models for Human Preferences is a Causal Inference Problem  
  
 Victoria Lin, Eli Ben-Michael, Louis-Philippe Morency  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 As large language models (LLMs) see greater use in academic and commercial settings, there is increasing interest in methods that allow language models to generate texts aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we present an initial exploration of language model optimization for human preferences from *direct outcome datasets*, where each sample consists of a text and an associated numerical outcome measuring the reader's response. We first propose that language model optimization should be viewed as a *causal problem* to ensure that the model correctly learns the relationship between the text and the outcome. We formalize this causal language optimization problem, and we develop a method—*causal preference optimization* (CPO)—that solves an unbiased surrogate objective for the problem. We further extend CPO with *doubly robust* CPO (DR-CPO), which reduces the variance of the surrogate objective while retaining provably strong guarantees on bias. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of (DR-)CPO in optimizing state-of-the-art LLMs for human preferences on direct outcome data, and we validate the robustness of DR-CPO under difficult confounding conditions.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Gradient dominance property is a condition weaker than strong convexity, yet sufficiently ensures global convergence even in non-convex optimization. This property finds wide applications in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and operations management. In this paper, we propose the stochastic homogeneous second-order descent method (SHSODM) for stochastic functions enjoying gradient dominance property based on a recently proposed homogenization approach. Theoretically, we provide its sample complexity analysis, and further present an enhanced result by incorporating variance reduction techniques. Our findings show that SHSODM matches the best-known sample complexity achieved by other second-order methods for gradient-dominated stochastic optimization but without cubic regularization. Empirically, since the homogenization approach only relies on solving extremal eigenvector problem at each iteration instead of Newton-type system, our methods gain the advantage of cheaper computational cost and robustness in ill-conditioned problems. Numerical experiments on several RL tasks demonstrate the better performance of SHSODM compared to other off-the-shelf methods.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices or clients to collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models without sharing their private data. Much of the existing work in FL focuses on efficiently learning a model for a single task. In this paper, we study simultaneous training of multiple FL models using a common set of clients. The few existing simultaneous training methods employ synchronous aggregation of client updates, which can cause significant delays because large models and/or slow clients can bottleneck the aggregation. On the other hand, a naive asynchronous aggregation is adversely affected by stale client updates. We propose FedAST, a buffered asynchronous federated simultaneous training algorithm that overcomes bottlenecks from slow models and adaptively allocates client resources across heterogeneous tasks. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for FedAST for smooth non-convex objective functions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing simultaneous FL approaches, achieving up to 46.0% reduction in time to train multiple tasks to completion.

  Abstract      
 *Probabilities of causation* (PoC) are valuable concepts for explainable artificial intelligence and practical decision-making. PoC are originally defined for scalar binary variables. In this paper, we extend the concept of PoC to continuous treatment and outcome variables, and further generalize PoC to capture causal effects between multiple treatments and multiple outcomes. In addition, we consider PoC for a sub-population and PoC with multi-hypothetical terms to capture more sophisticated counterfactual information useful for decision-making. We provide a nonparametric identification theorem for each type of PoC we introduce. Finally, we illustrate the application of our results on a real-world dataset about education.

  Abstract      
 Safeguarding critical infrastructure has recently emerged as a global challenge. To address complex security concerns raised by broadening array of threats, effective mobile security forces are essential. A key aspect involves designing optimal patrolling strategies for mobile units. Two bodies of research dealt with this: stochastic patrolling and partially observable stochastic games. Alas, the first approach makes too-far-reaching simplifying assumption and the second one is more expressive but computationally challenging. The model proposed in this paper is inspired by partially observable stochastic games so that it is general enough to enable comprehensive modeling of attacker-defender interactions but a the same time remains computationally friendly. With our proposed robust SHIELD algorithm, we are able to find a defense strategy where the probability of apprehending the attacker can be nearly doubled compared to the state of the art.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Learning the structures of structural equation models (SEMs) as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from data is crucial for representing causal relationships in various scientific domains. Instead of estimating individual DAG structures, it is often preferable to directly estimate changes in causal relations between conditions, such as changes in genetic expression between healthy and diseased subjects. This work studies the problem of directly estimating the difference between two linear SEMs, i.e. *without estimating the individual DAG structures*, given two sets of samples drawn from the individual SEMs. We consider general classes of linear SEMs where the noise distributions are allowed to be Gaussian or non-Gaussian and have different noise variances across the variables in the individual SEMs. We rigorously characterize novel conditions related to the topological layering of the structural difference that lead to the *identifiability* of the difference DAG (DDAG). Moreover, we propose an *efficient* algorithm to identify the DDAG via sequential re-estimation of the difference of precision matrices. A surprising implication of our results is that causal changes can be identifiable even between *non-identifiable* models such as Gaussian SEMs with unequal noise variances. Synthetic experiments are presented to validate our theoretical results and to show the scalability of our method.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Causal spaces have recently been introduced as a measure-theoretic framework to encode the notion of causality. While it has some advantages over established frameworks, such as structural causal models, the theory is so far only developed for single causal spaces. In many mathematical theories, not least the theory of probability spaces of which causal spaces are a direct extension, combinations of objects and maps between objects form a central part. In this paper, taking inspiration from such objects in probability theory, we propose the definitions of products of causal spaces, as well as (stochastic) transformations between causal spaces. In the context of causality, these quantities can be given direct semantic interpretations as causally independent components, abstractions and extensions. 
 ID: 656 | Enhancing Patient Recruitment Response in Clinical Trials: an Adaptive Learning Framework  
  
 Xinying Fang, Shouhao Zhou  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Patient recruitment remains a key challenge in contemporary clinical trials, often leading to trial failures due to insufficient recruitment rates. To address this issue, we introduce a novel adaptive learning framework that integrates machine learning methods to facilitate evidence-informed recruitment. Through dynamic testing, predictive learning, and adaptive pruning of recruitment plans, the proposed framework ensures superiority over the conventional random assignment approach. We discuss the practical considerations for implementing this framework and conduct a simulation study to assess the overall response rates and chances of improvement. The findings suggest that the proposed approach can substantially enhance patient recruitment efficiency. By systematically optimizing recruitment plan allocation, this adaptive learning framework shows promise in addressing recruitment challenges across broad clinical research settings, potentially transforming how patient recruitment is managed in clinical trials.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Although recent advances in machine learning have shown its success to learn from independent and identically distributed (IID) data, it is vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) data in an open world. Domain generalization (DG) deals with such an issue and it aims to learn a model from multiple source domains that can be generalized to unseen target domains. Existing studies on DG have largely focused on stationary settings with homogeneous source domains. However, in many applications, domains may evolve along a specific direction (e.g., time, space). Without accounting for such non-stationary patterns, models trained with existing methods may fail to generalize on OOD data. In this paper, we study domain generalization in non-stationary environment. We first examine the impact of environmental non-stationarity on model performance and establish the theoretical upper bounds for the model error at target domains. Then, we propose a novel algorithm based on adaptive invariant representation learning, which leverages the non-stationary pattern to train a model that attains good performance on target domains. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed algorithm.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for data quantization based on the principles of Kashin representation. This approach hinges on decomposing any given vector, matrix, or tensor into two factors. The first factor maintains a small infinity norm, while the second exhibits a similarly constrained norm when multiplied by an orthogonal matrix. Surprisingly, the entries of factors after decomposition are well-concentrated around several peaks, which allows us to efficiently replace them with corresponding centroids for quantization purposes. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed approach and rigorously evaluate our compression algorithm in the context of next-word prediction tasks, employing models like OPT of varying sizes. Our findings demonstrate that Kashin Quantization achieves competitive quality in model performance while ensuring superior data compression, marking a significant advancement in the field of data quantization.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We present a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in classification tasks based on label-wise decomposition of uncertainty measures. This label-wise perspective allows uncertainty to be quantified at the individual class level, thereby improving cost-sensitive decision-making and helping understand the sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, it allows to define total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty on the basis of non-categorical measures such as variance, going beyond common entropy-based measures. In particular, variance-based measures address some of the limitations associated with established methods that have recently been discussed in the literature. We show that our proposed measures adhere to a number of desirable properties. Through empirical evaluation on a variety of benchmark data sets -- including applications in the medical domain where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial -- we establish the effectiveness of label-wise uncertainty quantification.

  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Transformers have increasingly become the de facto method to model sequential data with state-of-the-art performance. Due to its widespread use, being able to estimate and calibrate its modeling uncertainty is important to understand and design robust transformer models. To achieve this, previous works have used Gaussian processes (GPs) to perform uncertainty calibration for the attention units of transformers and attained notable successes. However, such approaches have to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure the necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which reduces the representation capacity of the model. To mitigate this restriction, we propose the Correlated Gaussian Process Transformer (CGPT), a new class of transformers whose self-attention units are modeled as cross-covariance between two correlated GPs (CGPs). This allows asymmetries in attention and can enhance the representation capacity of GP-based transformers. We also derive a sparse approximation for CGP to make it scale better. Our empirical studies show that both CGP-based and sparse CGP-based transformers achieve better performance than state-of-the-art GP-based transformers on a variety of benchmark tasks.

 Abhilash Reddy Chenreddy, Erick Delage  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The field of Contextual Optimization (CO) integrates machine learning and optimization to solve decision making problems under uncertainty. Recently, a risk sensitive variant of CO, known as Conditional Robust Optimization (CRO), combines uncertainty quantification with robust optimization in order to promote safety and reliability in high stake applications. Exploiting modern differentiable optimization methods, we propose a novel end-to-end approach to train a CRO model in a way that accounts for both the empirical risk of the prescribed decisions and the quality of conditional coverage of the contextual uncertainty set that supports them. While guarantees of success for the latter objective are impossible to obtain from the point of view of conformal prediction theory, high quality conditional coverage is achieved empirically by ingeniously employing a logistic regression differentiable layer within the calculation of coverage quality in our training loss.We show that the proposed training algorithms produce decisions that outperform the traditional estimate then optimize approaches.

  Abstract      
 Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) predictors that conform to symbolic knowledge – encoding, e.g., safety constraints – can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs): They learn concepts consistent with the symbolic knowledge by exploiting unintended semantics. RSs compromise reliability and generalization and, as we show in this paper, they are linked to NeSy models being overconfident about the predicted concepts. Unfortunately, the only trustworthy mitigation strategy requires collecting costly dense supervision over the concepts. Rather than attempting to avoid RSs altogether, we propose to ensure NeSy models are aware of the semantic ambiguity of the concepts they learn, thus enabling their users to identify and distrust low-quality concepts. Starting from three simple desiderata, we derive bears (BE Aware of Reasoning Shortcuts), an ensembling technique that calibrates the model’s concept-level confidence without compromising prediction accuracy, thus encouraging NeSy architectures to be uncertain about concepts affected by RSs. We show empirically that bears improves RS-awareness of several state-of-the-art NeSy models, and also facilitates acquiring informative dense annotations for mitigation purposes. 
 ID: 696 | Walking the Values in Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning

  Abstract      
 The goal of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is recovering a posterior distribution over reward functions using a set of demonstrations from an expert optimizing for a reward unknown to the learner. The resulting posterior over rewards can then be used to synthesize an apprentice policy that performs well on the same or a similar task. A key challenge in Bayesian IRL is bridging the computational gap between the hypothesis space of possible rewards and the likelihood, often defined in terms of Q values: vanilla Bayesian IRL needs to solve the costly forward planning problem -- going from rewards to the Q values -- at every step of the algorithm, which may need to be done thousands of times. We propose to solve this by a simple change: instead of focusing on primarily sampling in the space of rewards, we can focus on primarily working in the space of Q-values, since the computation required to go from Q-values to reward is radically cheaper. Furthermore, this reversion of the computation makes it easy to compute the gradient allowing efficient sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We propose ValueWalk -- a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on this insight -- and illustrate its advantages on several tasks. 
 ID: 703 | Learning to Rank for Active Learning via Multi-Task Bilevel Optimization  
  
 Zixin Ding, Si Chen, Ruoxi Jia, Yuxin Chen  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Active learning is a promising paradigm for reducing labeling costs by strategically requesting labels to improve model performance. However, existing active learning methods often rely on expensive acquisition functions, extensive model retraining, and multiple rounds of interaction with annotators. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for active learning, which aims to select batches of unlabeled instances through a learned surrogate model for data acquisition. A key challenge in this approach is to develop an acquisition function that generalizes well, as the history of data, which forms part of the utility function's input, grows over time. Our novel algorithmic contribution is a multi-task bilevel optimization framework that predicts the relative utility---measured by the validation accuracy---of different training sets, and ensures the learned acquisition function generalizes effectively. For cases where validation accuracy is expensive to evaluate, we introduce efficient interpolation-based surrogate models to estimate the utility function, reducing the evaluation cost. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through extensive experiments on standard active classification benchmarks. 
 ID: 708 | Bounding causal effects with leaky instruments  
  
 David Watson, Gecia Bravo-Hermsdorff, Lee M. Gunderson, Jordan Penn, Afsaneh Mastouri, Ricardo Silva  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular and powerful tool for estimating causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, classical approaches rely on strong assumptions such as the $\textit{exclusion criterion}$, which states that instrumental effects must be entirely mediated by treatments. This assumption often fails in practice. When IV methods are improperly applied to data that do not meet the exclusion criterion, estimated causal effects may be badly biased. In this work, we propose a novel solution that provides $\textit{partial}$ identification in linear systems given a set of $\textit{leaky instruments}$, which are allowed to violate the exclusion criterion to some limited degree. We derive a convex optimization objective that provides provably sharp bounds on the average treatment effect under some common forms of information leakage, and implement inference procedures to quantify the uncertainty of resulting estimates. We demonstrate our method in a set of experiments with simulated data, where it performs favorably against the state of the art. An accompanying $\texttt{R}$ package, $\texttt{leakyIV}$, is available from $\texttt{CRAN}$. 
 ID: 709 | Generalization and Learnability in Multiple Instance Regression  
  
 Kushal Chauhan, Rishi Saket, Lorne Applebaum, Ashwinkumar Badanidiyuru, Chandan Giri, Aravindan Raghuveer  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Multiple instance regression (MIR) was introduced by Ray and Page (2001) as an analogue of multiple instance learning (MIL) in which we are given bags of feature-vectors (instances) and for each bag there is a bag-label which matches the label of one (unknown) primary instance from that bag. The goal is to compute a hypothesis regressor consistent with the underlying instance-labels. A natural approach is to find the best primary instance assignment and regressor optimizing the mse loss on the bags though no formal generalization guarantees were known. Our work is the first to prove generalization error bounds for MIR when the bags are drawn i.i.d. at random. Essentially, with high probability any MIR regressor with low error on sampled bags also has low error on the underlying instance-label distribution. We next study the complexity of linear regression on MIR bags, shown to be NP-hard in general by Ray and Page (2001), who however left open the possibility of arbitrarily good approximations. Significantly strengthening previous work, we prove a strong inapproximability bound: even if there exists zero bag-loss MIR linear regressor on a collection of $2$-sized bags with labels in $[-1,1]$, it is NP-hard to find an MIR linear regressor with bag-loss $< C$ for some absolute constant $C > 0$. Our work also proposes a model training method for MIR based on a novel weighted assignment loss, geared towards handling overlapping bags which have not received much attention previously. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets showing that our method outperforms the baseline MIR methods. 
 ID: 710 | Beyond Dirichlet-based Models: When Bayesian Neural Networks Meet Evidential Deep Learning  
  
 Hanjing Wang, Qiang Ji  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) excel in uncertainty quantification (UQ) by estimating the posterior distribution of model parameters, yet face challenges due to the high computational demands of Bayesian inference. Evidential deep learning methods address this by treating target distribution parameters as random variables with a learnable conjugate distribution, enabling efficient UQ. However, there's debate over whether these methods can accurately estimate epistemic uncertainty due to their single-network, sampling-free nature. In this paper, we combine the strengths of both approaches by distilling BNN knowledge into a Dirichlet-based model, endowing it with a Bayesian perspective and theoretical guarantees. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements to further improve the integration of Bayesian UQ with Dirichlet-based models. To relax the heavy computational load with BNNs, we introduce a self-regularized training strategy using Laplacian approximation (LA) for self-distillation. To alleviate the conjugate prior assumption, we employ an expressive normalizing flow for refining the model in a post-processing manner, where a few training iterations can enhance model performance. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in both UQ accuracy and robustness. 
 ID: 720 | Stein Random Feature Regression  
  
 Houston Warren, Rafael Oliveira, Fabio Ramos  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 In large-scale regression problems, random Fourier features (RFFs) have significantly enhanced the computational scalability and flexibility of Gaussian processes (GPs) by defining kernels through their spectral density, from which a finite set of Monte Carlo samples can be used to form an approximate low-rank GP. However, the efficacy of RFFs in kernel approximation and Bayesian kernel learning depends on the ability to tractably sample the kernel spectral measure and the quality of the generated samples. We introduce Stein random features (SRF), leveraging Stein variational gradient descent, which can be used to both generate high-quality RFF samples of known spectral densities as well as flexibly and efficiently approximate traditionally non-analytical spectral measure posteriors. SRFs require only the evaluation of log-probability gradients to perform both kernel approximation and Bayesian kernel learning that results in superior performance over traditional approaches. We empirically validate the effectiveness of SRFs by comparing them to baselines on kernel approximation and well-known GP regression problems. 
 ID: 724 | Value-Based Abstraction Functions for Abstraction Sampling  
  
 Bobak Pezeshki, Kalev Kask, Alexander Ihler, Rina Dechter  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for solving problems involving complex probability distributions. Despite their versatility, these methods often suffer from inefficiencies, especially when dealing with rare events. As such, importance sampling emerged as a prominent technique for alleviating these challenges. Recently, a new scheme called Abstraction Sampling was developed that incorporated stratification to importance sampling over graphical models. However, existing work only explored a limited set of abstraction functions that guide stratification. This study introduces three new classes of abstraction functions combined with seven distinct partitioning schemes, resulting in twenty-one new abstraction functions, each motivated by theory and intuition from both search and sampling domains. An extensive empirical analysis on over 400 problems compares these new schemes highlighting several well-performing candidates. 
 ID: 730 | Vertical Validation: Evaluating Implicit Generative Models for Graphs on Thin Support Regions  
  
 Mai Elkady, Thu Bui, Bruno Ribeiro, David I. Inouye  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 There has been a growing excitement that implicit graph generative models could be used to design or discover new molecules for medicine or material design. Because these molecules have not been discovered, they naturally lie in unexplored or scarcely supported regions of the distribution of known molecules. However, prior evaluation methods for implicit graph generative models have focused on validating statistics computed from the thick support (e.g., mean and variance of a graph property). Therefore, there is a mismatch between the goal of generating novel graphs and the evaluation methods. To address this evaluation gap, we design a novel evaluation method called Vertical Validation (VV) that systematically creates thin support regions during the train-test splitting procedure and then reweights generated samples so that they can be compared to the held-out test data. This procedure can be seen as a generalization of the standard train-test procedure except that the splits are dependent on sample features. We demonstrate that our method can be used to perform model selection if performance on thin support regions is the desired goal. As a side benefit, we also show that our approach can better detect overfitting as exemplified by memorization. 
 ID: 736 | Causal Discovery with Deductive Reasoning: One Less Problem  
  
 Jonghwan Kim, Inwoo Hwang, Sanghack Lee  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms aim to extract causal relationships between variables of interest by using conditional independence tests (CITs). However, CITs with large conditioning sets often lead to unreliable results due to their low statistical power, propagating errors throughout the course of causal discovery. As the reliability of CITs is crucial for their practical applicability, recent approaches rely on either tricky heuristics or complicated routines with high computational costs to tackle inconsistent test results. Against this background, we propose a principled, simple, yet effective method, coined \textsc{deduce-dep}, which corrects unreliable conditional independence statements by replacing them with deductively reasoned results from lower-order CITs. An appealing property of \textsc{deduce-dep} is that it can be seamlessly plugged into existing constraint-based methods and serves as a modular subroutine. In particular, we showcase the integration of \textsc{deduce-dep} into representative algorithms such as HITON-PC and PC, illustrating its practicality. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our method properly corrects unreliable CITs, leading to improved performance in causal structure learning. 
 ID: 738 | On the Inductive Biases of Demographic Parity-based Fair Learning Algorithms  
  
 Haoyu LEI, Amin Gohari, Farzan Farnia  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Fair supervised learning algorithms assigning labels with little dependence on a sensitive attribute have attracted great attention in the machine learning community. While the demographic parity (DP) notion has been frequently used to measure a model's fairness in training fair classifiers, several studies in the literature suggest potential impacts of enforcing DP in fair learning algorithms. In this work, we analytically study the effect of standard DP-based regularization methods on the conditional distribution of the predicted label given the sensitive attribute. Our analysis shows that an imbalanced training dataset with a non-uniform distribution of the sensitive attribute could lead to a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding the majority of training data. To control such inductive biases in DP-based fair learning, we propose a sensitive attribute-based distributionally robust optimization (SA-DRO) method improving robustness against the marginal distribution of the sensitive attribute. Finally, we present several numerical results on the application of DP-based learning methods to standard centralized and distributed learning problems. The empirical findings support our theoretical results on the inductive biases in DP-based fair learning algorithms and the debiasing effects of the proposed SA-DRO method.

 ID: 739 | Polynomial Semantics of Tractable Probabilistic Circuits  
 [oral]  
 Oliver Broadrick, Honghua Zhang, Guy Van den Broeck  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Probabilistic circuits compute multilinear polynomials that represent probability distributions. They are tractable models that support efficient marginal inference. However, various polynomial semantics have been considered in the literature (e.g., network polynomials, likelihood polynomials, generating functions, Fourier transforms, and characteristic polynomials). The relationships between these polynomial encodings of distributions is largely unknown. In this paper, we prove that for binary distributions, each of these probabilistic circuit models is equivalent in the sense that any circuit for one of them can be transformed into a circuit for any of the others with only a polynomial increase in size. They are therefore all tractable for marginal inference on the same class of distributions. Finally, we explore the natural extension of one such polynomial semantics, called probabilistic generating circuits, to categorical random variables, and establish that marginal inference becomes #P-hard. 
 ID: 746 | Sound Heuristic Search Value Iteration for Undiscounted POMDPs with Reachability Objectives  
  
 Qi Heng Ho, Martin S. Feather, Federico Rossi, Zachary N Sunberg, Morteza Lahijanian  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are powerful models for sequential decision making under transition and observation uncertainties. This paper studies the challenging yet important problem in POMDPs known as the (indefinite-horizon) Maximal Reachability Probability Problem (MRPP), where the goal is to maximize the probability of reaching some target states. This is also a core problem in model checking with logical specifications and is naturally undiscounted (discount factor is one). Inspired by the success of point-based methods developed for discounted problems, we study their extensions to MRPP. Specifically, we focus on trial-based heuristic search value iteration techniques and present a novel algorithm that leverages the strengths of these techniques for efficient exploration of the belief space (informed search via value bounds) while addressing their drawbacks in handling loops for indefinite-horizon problems. The algorithm produces policies with two-sided bounds on optimal reachability probabilities. We prove convergence to an optimal policy from below under certain conditions. Experimental evaluations on a suite of benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in almost all cases in both probability guarantees and computation time. 
 ID: 750 | Evaluating Bayesian deep learning for radio galaxy classification  
  
 Devina Mohan, Anna M M Scaife  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 The radio astronomy community is rapidly adopting deep learning techniques to deal with the huge data volumes expected from the next generation of radio observatories. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a principled way to model uncertainty in the predictions made by such deep learning models and will play an important role in extracting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates on their outputs. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different BNNs against the following criteria: predictive performance, uncertainty calibration and distribution-shift detection for the radio galaxy classification problem. 
 ID: 758 | Offline Reward Perturbation Boosts Distributional Shift in Online RL  
  
 Zishun Yu, Siteng Kang, Xinhua Zhang  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Offline-to-online reinforcement learning has recently been shown effective in reducing the online sample complexity by first training from offline collected data. However, this additional data source may also invite new poisoning attacks that target offline training. In this work, we reveal such vulnerabilities in $\textit{critic-regularized}$ offline RL by proposing a novel data poisoning attack method, which is stealthy in the sense that the performance during the offline training remains intact, but the online fine-tuning stage will suffer a significant performance drop. Our method leverages the techniques from bi-level optimization to promote the over-estimation/distribution shift under offline-to-online reinforcement learning. Experiments on four environments confirm the satisfaction of the new stealthiness requirement and can be effective in attacking with only a small budget and without having white-box access to the victim model. 
 ID: 763 | Linear Opinion Pooling for Uncertainty Quantification on Graphs  
  
 Clemens Damke, Eyke Hüllermeier  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 We address the problem of uncertainty quantification for graph-structured data, or, more specifically, the problem to quantify the predictive uncertainty in (semi-supervised) node classification. Key questions in this regard concern the distinction between two different types of uncertainty, aleatoric and epistemic, and how to support uncertainty quantification by leveraging the structural information provided by the graph topology. Challenging assumptions and postulates of state-of-the-art methods, we propose a novel approach that represents (epistemic) uncertainty in terms of mixtures of Dirichlet distributions and refers to the established principle of linear opinion pooling for propagating information between neighbored nodes in the graph. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in a series of experiments on a variety of graph-structured datasets. 
 ID: 778 | Neural Architecture Search Finds Robust Models by Knowledge Distillation  
  
 Utkarsh Nath, Yancheng Wang, Yingzhen Yang  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 Despite their superior performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a method for automatically designing the architectures of DNNs, has shown remarkable performance across various machine learning applications. However, the adversarial robustness of architectures learned by NAS against adversarial threats remains under-explored. By integrating a robust teacher, we examine whether NAS can yield a robust neural architecture by inheriting robustness from the teacher. In this paper, we propose Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge Distillation (RNAS-CL), a novel NAS algorithm that enhances the robustness of architectures learned by NAS through employing cross-layer knowledge distillation from a robust teacher. Distinct from previous knowledge distillation approaches that only align student-teacher outputs at the final layer, RNAS-CL dynamically searches for the optimal teacher layer to guide each student layer. Our experimental findings validate the effectiveness of RNAS-CL, demonstrating that it can generate both compact and adversarially robust neural architectures. Our results pave the way for developing new strategies for compact and robust neural architecture design applicable across various fields. The code of RNAS-CL is available at \url{https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/RNAS-CL}. 
 ID: 780 | Efficiently Deciding Algebraic Equivalence of Bow-Free Acyclic Path Diagrams  
  
 Thijs van Ommen  
  [ OpenReview  ] [ Proceedings  ]  
  
  Abstract      
 For causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders, constraints beyond conditional independences exist that can enable causal discovery algorithms to distinguish more pairs of graphs. Such constraints are not well-understood yet. In the setting of linear structural equation models without bows, we study algebraic constraints and argue that these provide the most fine-grained resolution achievable. We propose efficient algorithms that decide whether two graphs impose the same algebraic constraints, or whether the constraints imposed by one graph are a subset of those imposed by another graph.

  Track 11: Security and Regulation: Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Trust- Protecting information and ensuring responsible technology use

 Track Call  
 Cybersecurity, privacy and trust are the three fundamental pillars of the digital economy (Gritzalis et al., 2019). An organization wishing to do business online today must ensure that their products and processes are designed in a manner which embed these pillars as values  and functional requirements  from the outset, and not merely as added siloed bolt-ons. Cybersecurity, privacy and trust are not “nice-to-haves” in product and process design, they are essential elements that are related to the long-term ethics, responsibility and sustainability (ERS) of any organization (Laasch et al., 2023). As customers provide data through day-to-day transactions, and businesses rely on that data to make decisions, the expectation is that personal customer data and organizational business data remain secure (Michael et al., 2019). Cybersecurity is increasingly becoming a complex endeavor when we consider meshed chains in open socio-technical systems that are subject to vulnerabilities up and down-stream (Young, 2022; Austin and Withers, 2020; Paja et al., 2013). Regulations and the law also mandate that there must be a reason for customer data to be collected and used that has a direct relevance to business operations, and can only be done so with the consent of the individual. Retrospective use of that data, or data gathered without the consent of the individual is protected through laws. We are calling for papers that take a variety of approaches and methodologies at addressing the global cybersecurity and regulation challenge.  
 Track Areas  
 We thus invite the following topics for submissions in this track:  
 The development of theoretical frameworks, and the conceptualisation of cybersecurity, privacy, trust and regulation within a risk context; 
  Evolving models of cybersecurity to respond to increasingly complex threats posed by emerging technologies and the malicious use of computer technology for unauthorised access; 
  New ways to qualify or quantify harms to citizens, costs to organizations, and the impact to national security as a result of cybersecurity breaches; 
  Analysing emerging instruments in law and regulation for responsible technology impact assessment and utilisation, as regards human rights, child rights, social impact, risk, privacy and more, for their consistency and stakeholder responsiveness; 
  Methods for addressing issues of cybercrime prevention, remediation and recovery, through monetary measurement of impact, including for privacy data breaches in large organisations and other impacts; 
  Training of stakeholders and officials in ethical dimensions of cybersecurity policy including privacy and trust, to help guide their organisational change and policy development; 
  Better understanding the threat that weak cybersecurity practices may pose in the metaverse for differing user types, from the erosion of privacy and respective intrusions to one’s trust in transacting in the virtual realm; 
  Organizational responses to cybersecurity, privacy, trust, and regulation within a digital business context to reconceptualize cybersecurity awareness toward business transformation; 
  Understanding responsibility for significant data breaches beyond regulatory compliance and penalties and toward a multi-stakeholder accountability solution; 
  The ability to better assess emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and quantum computing and the role they will play to combat cybersecurity threats at the micro, meso, macro layers, as well as for new offensive attack vectors;

 UbiComp 2013  
 The 2013 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing  (UbiComp 2013) is the result of a merger of the two most renown conferences in the field: Pervasive  and UbiComp  . While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.  
   The conference was held in this new merged format for the very first time from September 8-12, 2013  , in Zurich, Switzerland.  
 The UbiComp 2013 Proceedings  are available via the ACM Digital Library (ISBN 978-1-4503-1770-2).  
 By offering a single venue for the leading worldwide research in Pervasive and Ubiquitous computing, the new format is meant to better serve the needs of the research community by attracting more attendees (including the leading Pervasive/UbiComp researchers worldwide), and enabling more satellite events. UbiComp 2013 was multi-track and featured a program  of 92 scientific paper presentations (acceptance rate 23.4%)  . Topics included any work that one would previously expect to find at either UbiComp or Pervasive.  
 Following several successful collaborations as part of the Pervasive conference series, UbiComp 2013 continued the tradition of collocating with ISWC 2013  .  
 The adjunct program  is available at www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2013/adjunct/starthere.htm  . You can alternatively download all adjunct papers in a single 1.24GB ZIP-file: UbiComp2013_adjunct.zip

 ID: 8 | Exploration for Free: How Does Reward Heterogeneity Improve Regret in Cooperative Multi-agent Bandits?   
  
 Xuchuang Wang, Lin Yang, Yu-Zhen Janice Chen, Xutong Liu, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Don Towsley, John C.S. Lui  

  TL;DR:  We study the free exploration mechanism in the multi-agent multi-armed bandits with heterogeneous reward model.   Abstract:   
 This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent bandit scenario in which the rewards observed by agents are heterogeneous---one agent's meat can be another agent's poison. Specifically, the total reward observed by each agent is the sum of two values: an arm-specific reward, capturing the intrinsic value of the arm, and a privately-known agent-specific reward, which captures the personal preference/limitations of the agent. This heterogeneity in total reward leads to different local optimal arms for agents but creates an opportunity for *free exploration* in a cooperative setting---an agent can freely explore its local optimal arm with no regret and share this free observation with some other agents who would suffer regrets if they pull this arm since the arm is not optimal for them. We first characterize a regret lower bound that captures free exploration, i.e., arms that can be freely explored have no contribution to the regret lower bound. Then, we present a cooperative bandit algorithm that takes advantage of free exploration and achieves a near-optimal regret upper bound which tightly matches the regret lower bound up to a constant factor. Lastly, we run numerical simulations to compare our algorithm with various baselines without free exploration. 
 ID: 11 | ViBid: Linear Vision Transformer with Bidirectional Normalization   
  
 Jeonggeun Song, Heung-Chang Lee  

  TL;DR:  We empirically demonstrated the shortcomings of softmax-free and the significance of softmax in attention through BiNorm experiments. Binorm is the simplest adaptation of the current matrix multiplication order-changing algorithms.   Abstract:   
 The vision transformer has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks; however, the memory consumption is larger than those of previous convolutional neural network based models because of O(N^2) time and memory complexity of the general self-attention models. Many approaches aim to change the complexity to O(N) to solve this problem; however, they stack deep convolutional layers to retain locality or complicate the architecture as seen in window attention, to compensate for the performance degradation. To solve these problems, we propose ViBid algorithm, which resolves the complexity problem of O(N^2) by replacing Softmax with bidirectional normalization (BiNorm). In addition, it has a much simpler architecture than the existing transformer model with O(N) complexity. Owing to our simple architecture, we were able to use larger resolutions for training, and we obtained a lighter and superior GPU throughput model with competitive performance. ViBid can be used with any transformer method that uses queries, keys, and values (QKV) because of BiNorm, and it is quite universal due to its simple architectural structure. 
 ID: 24 | Pessimistic Model Selection for Deep Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Chao-Han Huck Yang, Zhengling Qi, Yifan Cui, Pin-Yu Chen  

  TL;DR:  A pessimistic model selection approach for offline deep reinforcement with a theoretical guarantee is presented.   Abstract:   
 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated great potentials in solving sequential decision making problems in many applications. Despite its promising performance, practical gaps exist when deploying DRL in real-world scenarios. One main barrier is the over-fitting issue that leads to poor generalizability of the policy learned by DRL. In particular, for offline DRL with observational data, model selection is a challenging task as there is no ground truth available for performance demonstration, in contrast with the online setting with simulated environments. In this work, we propose a pessimistic model selection (PMS) approach for offline DRL with a theoretical guarantee, which features a tuning-free framework for finding the best policy among a set of candidate models. Two refined approaches are also proposed to address the potential bias of DRL model in identifying the optimal policy. Numerical studies demonstrated the superior performance of our approach over existing methods. 
 ID: 31 | RDM-DC: Poisoning Resilient Dataset Condensation with Robust Distribution Matching   
  
 Tianhang Zheng, Baochun Li  

    Abstract:   
 Dataset condensation aims to condense the original training dataset into a small synthetic dataset for data-efficient learning. The recently proposed dataset condensation techniques allow the model trainers with limited resources to learn acceptable deep learning models on a small amount of synthetic data. However, in an adversarial environment, given the original dataset as a poisoned dataset, dataset condensation may encode the poisoning information into the condensed synthetic dataset. To explore the vulnerability of dataset condensation to data poisoning, we revisit the state-of-the-art targeted data poisoning method and customize a targeted data poisoning algorithm for dataset condensation. By executing the two poisoning methods, we demonstrate that, when the synthetic dataset is condensed from a poisoned dataset, the models trained on the synthetic dataset may predict the targeted sample as the attack-targeted label. To defend against data poisoning, we introduce the concept of poisoned deviation to quantify the poisoning effect. We further propose a poisoning-resilient dataset condensation algorithm with a calibration method to reduce poisoned deviation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can protect the synthetic dataset from data poisoning with minor performance drop.

  TL;DR:  The paper proposes a series of matrix correction algorithms that estimate similarity matrices with incomplete data streams in different online scenarios.   Abstract:   
 The similarity matrix measures the pairwise similarities between a set of data points. It is an essential concept in data processing and is routinely used in practical applications. Obtaining the similarity matrix is usually trivial when the data points are completely observed. However, getting a high-quality similarity matrix often turns hard when there are incomplete observations, which becomes even more complex on sequential data streams. To address the challenge, we propose matrix correction algorithms that leverage the positive semi-definiteness of the similarity matrix to provide improved similarity estimation in both offline and online scenarios. Our approaches have a solid theoretical guarantee of performance and excellent potential for parallel execution on large-scale data. They also exhibit high effectiveness and efficiency in empirical evaluations with significantly improved results over the classical imputation-based methods, benefiting downstream applications with superior performance.

  TL;DR:  We proposed the first practical consistent off-policy TD algorithm and showed its competitive performance.   Abstract:   
 Off-policy policy evaluation has been a critical and challenging problem in reinforcement learning, and Temporal-Difference (TD) learning is one of the most important approaches for addressing it. Notably, Full Importance-Sampling TD is the only existing off-policy TD method that is guaranteed to find the on-policy TD fixed point in the linear function approximation setting but, unfortunately, has a high variance and is scarcely practical. This notorious high variance issue motivates the introduction of Emphatic TD, which tames down the variance but has a biased fixed point. Inspired by these two methods, we propose a new consistent algorithm with a transient bias, which strikes a balance between bias and variance. Further, we unify the new algorithm with several existing algorithms and obtain a new family of consistent algorithms called \emph{Consistent Emphatic TD} (CETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$)), which can control a smooth bias-variance trade-off by varying the speed at which the transient bias fades. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on a didactic example, we validate the consistency of CETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$). Moreover, we show that CETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$) converges faster to the lowest error in a complex task with a high variance.

  TL;DR:  We develop a Gaussian Process based-method to learn choice functions from choice data via Pareto rationalisation.   Abstract:   
 In consumer theory, ranking available objects by means of preference relations yields the most common description of individual choices. However, preference-based models assume that individuals: (1) give their preferences only between pairs of objects; (2) are always able to pick the best preferred object. In many situations, they may be instead choosing out of a set with more than two elements and, because of lack of information and/or incomparability (objects with contradictory characteristics), they may not able to select a single most preferred object. To address these situations, we need a choice-model which allows an individual to express a set-valued choice. Choice functions provide such a mathematical framework. We propose a Gaussian Process model to learn choice functions from choice-data. The proposed model assumes a multiple utility representation of a choice function based on the concept of Pareto rationalisation, and derives a strategy to learn both the number and the values of these latent multiple utilities. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 
 ID: 40 | Exploiting Inferential Structure in Neural Processes   
  
 Dharmesh Tailor, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, Eric Nalisnick  

    Abstract:   
 Neural Processes (NPs) are appealing due to their ability to perform fast adaptation based on a context set. This set is encoded by a latent variable, which is often assumed to follow a simple distribution. However, in real-word settings, the context set may be drawn from richer distributions having multiple modes, heavy tails, etc. In this work, we provide a framework that allows NPs’ latent variable to be given a rich prior defined by a graphical model. These distributional assumptions directly translate into an appropriate aggregation strategy for the context set. Moreover, we describe a message-passing procedure that still allows for end-to-end optimization with stochastic gradients. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by using mixture and Student-t assumptions that yield improvements in function modelling and test-time robustness. 
 ID: 41 | Inference and Sampling of Point Processes from Diffusion Excursions   
 [spotlight]  
 Ali Hasan, Yu Chen, Yuting Ng, Mohamed Abdelghani, Anderson Schneider, Vahid Tarokh  

  TL;DR:  We develop methods to represent point processes in terms of excursions of a diffusion.   Abstract:   
 Point processes often have a natural interpretation with respect to a continuous process. We propose a point process construction that describes arrival time observations in terms of the state of a latent diffusion process. In this framework, we relate the return time of diffusion in a continuous path space to new arrivals of the point process. These models arise in many disciplines, such as financial settings where actions in a market are determined by a hidden continuous price or in neuroscience where a latent stimulus generates spike trains. Based on the developments in It\^o's excursion theory, we describe computational methods for inferring and sampling from the point process derived from the diffusion process. We provide numerical examples for the proposed method using both simulated and real data to illustrate the approach. The proposed methods and framework provide a basis for interpreting point processes through the lens of a diffusion. 
 ID: 42 | Learning Robust Representation for Reinforcement Learning with Distractions by Reward Sequence Prediction   
  
 Qi Zhou, Jie Wang, Qiyuan Liu, Yufei Kuang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li  

  TL;DR:  Our method learns robust representations by predicting reward sequences via a novel TD-style algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency and generalization in environments with distractions.   Abstract:   
 Reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved impressive success in learning behaviors from pixels. However, their application to real-world tasks remains challenging because of their sensitivity to visual distractions (e.g., changes in viewpoint and light). A major reason is that the learned representations often suffer from overfitting task-irrelevant information. By comparing several representation learning methods, we find that the key to robust representation learning is the choice of prediction targets. Therefore, we propose a novel representation learning approach---namely, Reward Sequence Prediction (RSP)---that uses reward sequences or their transforms (e.g., discrete time Fourier transform) as prediction targets. RSP can learn robust representations efficiently because reward sequences rarely contain task-irrelevant information while providing sufficient supervised signals to accelerate representation learning. An appealing feature is that RSP makes no assumption about the type of distractions and thus can improve performance even when multiple types of distractions exist. We evaluate our approach in Distracting Control Suite. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency and generalization ability in tasks with distractions. 
 ID: 45 | Information Theoretic Clustering via Divergence Maximization among Cluster Distributions   
  
 Sahil Garg, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Anderson Schneider, Yeshaya Adler, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Yu Chen, Fengpei Li, Guillermo Cecchi  

    Abstract:   
 Information-theoretic clustering is one of the most promising and principled approaches to finding clusters with minimal apriori assumptions. The key criterion therein is to maximize the mutual information between the data points and their cluster labels. We instead propose to maximize the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence between the underlying distributions associated to clusters (referred to as cluster distributions). We show it to be equivalent to optimizing over the mutual information criterion while simultaneously maximizing cross entropy between the cluster distributions. For practical efficiency, we propose to empirically estimate the objective of KL-D between clusters in its dual form leveraging deep neural nets as a dual function approximator. Remarkably, our theoretical analysis establishes that estimating the divergence measure in its dual form simplifies the problem of clustering to one of optimally finding k ‚àí 1 cut points for k clusters in the 1-D dual functional space. Overall, our approach enables linear-time clustering algorithms with theoretical guarantees of near-optimality, owing to the submodularity of the objective. We show the empirical superiority of our approach w.r.t. current state-of-the-art methods on the challenging task of clustering noisy timeseries as observed in domains such as neuroscience, healthcare, financial markets, spatio-temporal environmental dynamics, etc. 
 ID: 46 | In- or Out-of-Distribution Detection via Dual Divergence Estimation   
  
 Sahil Garg, Sanghamitra Dutta, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka  

    Abstract:   
 Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a problem of practical importance for a reliable use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in production settings. The corollary to this problem is the detection in-distribution (ID) samples, which is applicable to domain adaptation scenarios for augmenting a train set with ID samples from other data sets, or to continual learning for replay from the past. For both ID or OOD detection, we propose a principled yet simple approach of (empirically) estimating KL-Divergence, in its dual form, for a given test set w.r.t. a known set of ID samples in order to quantify the contribution of each test sample individually towards the divergence measure and accordingly detect it as OOD or ID. Our approach is compute-efficient and enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. For WideResnet101 and ViT-L-16, by considering ImageNet-1k dataset as the ID benchmark, we evaluate the proposed OOD detector on 51 test (OOD) datasets, and observe drastically and consistently lower false positive rates w.r.t. all the competitive methods. Moreover, the proposed ID detector is evaluated, using ECG and stock price datasets, for the task of data augmentation in domain adaptation and continual learning settings, and we observe higher efficacy compared to relevant baselines. 
 ID: 47 | On Identifiability of Conditional Causal Effects   
  
 Yaroslav Kivva, Jalal Etesami, Negar Kiyavash  

    Abstract:   
 We address the problem of identifiability of an arbitrary conditional causal effect given both the causal graph and a set of any observational and/or interventional distributions of the form $Q[S]:=P(S|do(V\setminus S))$, where $V$ denotes the set of all observed variables and $S\subseteq V$. We call this problem conditional generalized identifiability (c-gID in short) and prove the completeness of Pearl's $do$-calculus for the c-gID problem by providing sound and complete algorithm for the c-gID problem. This work revisited the c-gID problem in Lee et al. [2020], Correa et al. [2021] by adding explicitly the positivity assumption which is crucial for identifiability. It extends the results of [Lee et al., 2019, Kivva et al., 2022] on general identifiability (gID) which studied the problem for unconditional causal effects and Shpitser and Pearl [2006b] on identifiability of conditional causal effects given merely the observational distribution $P(\mathbf{V})$ as our algorithm generalizes the algorithms proposed in [Kivva et al., 2022] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006b].

 [spotlight]  
 Ling Pan, Dinghuai Zhang, Moksh Jain, Longbo Huang, Yoshua Bengio  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel Stochastic GFlowNet method for extending GFlowNets to the more general stochastic environments.   Abstract:   
 Generative Flow Networks (or GFlowNets for short) are a family of probabilistic agents that learn to sample complex combinatorial structures through the lens of ``inference as control''. They have shown great potential in generating high-quality and diverse candidates from a given energy landscape. However, existing GFlowNets can be applied only to deterministic environments, and fail in more general tasks with stochastic dynamics, which can limit their applicability. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces Stochastic GFlowNets, a new algorithm that extends GFlowNets to stochastic environments. By decomposing state transitions into two steps, Stochastic GFlowNets isolate environmental stochasticity and learn a dynamics model to capture it. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic GFlowNets offer significant advantages over standard GFlowNets as well as MCMC- and RL-based approaches, on a variety of standard benchmarks with stochastic dynamics. 
 ID: 67 | Personalized Federated Domain Adaptation for Item-to-Item Recommendation   
  
 Ziwei Fan, Trong Nghia Hoang, HAO DING, Anoop Deoras  

  TL;DR:  We propose and investigate a personalized federated modeling framework based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt recommendation patterns across markets with heterogeneous customer behaviors into effective local models   Abstract:   
 Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation is an important function in most recommendation systems, which generates replacement or complement suggestions for a particular item based on its semantic similarities to other cataloged items. Given that subsets of items in a recommendation system might be co-interacted with by the same set of customers, graph-based models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), provide a natural framework to combine, ingest and extract valuable insights from such high-order relational interactions between cataloged items, as well as their metadata features, as has been shown in many recent studies. However, learning GNNs effectively for I2I requires ingesting a large amount of relational data, which might not always be available, especially in new, emerging market segments. To mitigate this data bottleneck, we postulate that recommendation patterns learned from existing mature market segments (with private data) could be adapted to build effective warm-start models for emerging ones. To achieve this, we propose and investigate a personalized federated modeling framework based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt recommendation patterns across market segments with heterogeneous customer behaviors into effective local models. Our key contribution is a personalized graph adaptation model that bridges the gap between recent literature on federated GNNs and (non-graph) personalized federated learning, which either does not optimize for the adaptability of the federated model or is restricted to local models with homogeneous parameterization, excluding GNNs with heterogeneous local graphs. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated on a real-world dataset on multiple item categories spanning multiple market segments.

  TL;DR:  BISCUIT identifies causal variables from high-dimensional observations using binary interactions between an external system (e.g. robot) and the causal variables.   Abstract:   
 Identifying the causal variables of an environment and how to intervene on them is of core value in applications such as robotics and embodied AI. While an agent can commonly interact with the environment and may implicitly perturb the behavior of some of these causal variables, often the targets it affects remain unknown. In this paper, we show that causal variables can still be identified for many common setups, e.g., additive Gaussian noise models, if the agent's interactions with a causal variable can be described by an unknown binary variable. This happens when each causal variable has two different mechanisms, e.g., an observational and an interventional one. Using this identifiability result, we propose BISCUIT, a method for simultaneously learning causal variables and their corresponding binary interaction variables. On three robotic-inspired datasets, BISCUIT accurately identifies causal variables and can even be scaled to complex, realistic environments for embodied AI. 
 ID: 80 | Memory Mechanism for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection   
  
 Jiahao Li, Yiqiang Chen, Yunbing Xing  

  TL;DR:  This paper proposed a memory mechanism to enable the model learning to know unknowns.   Abstract:   
 Unsupervised anomaly detection is a binary classification that detects anomalies in unseen samples given only unlabeled normal data. Reconstruction-based approaches are widely used, which perform reconstruction error minimization on training data to learn normal patterns and quantify the degree of anomalies by reconstruction errors on testing data. However, this approach tends to miss anomalies when the normal data has multi-pattern. Because the model generalizes unrestrictedly beyond normal patterns even to include anomaly patterns. In this paper, we proposed a memory mechanism that memorizes typical normal patterns through a capacity-controlled external differentiable matrix so that the generalization of the model to anomalies is limited by the retrieval of the matrix. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks. 
 ID: 82 | Split, Count, and Share: A Differentially Private Set Intersection Cardinality Estimation Protocol   
  
 Michael Purcell, Yang Li, Kee Siong Ng  

  TL;DR:  We present a simple privacy-preserving protocol for estimating the cardinality of the intersection of two sets.   Abstract:   
 We describe a simple two-party protocol in which each party contributes a set as input. The output of the protocol is an estimate of the cardinality of the intersection of the two input sets. We show that our protocol is efficient and secure. In particular, we show that the space complexity and communication complexity are constant, the time complexity for each party is proportional to the size of their input set, and that our protocol is differentially private. We also analyze the distribution of the output of the protocol, deriving both its asymptotic distribution and finite-sample bounds on its tail probabilities. These analyses show that, when the input sets are large, our protocol produces accurate set intersection cardinality estimates. As such, we claim that our protocol is an attractive alternative to traditional private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocols when the input sets are large, exact precision is not required, and differential privacy on its own can provide sufficient protection to the underlying sensitive data. 
 ID: 84 | How to Use Dropout Correctly on Residual Networks with Batch Normalization   
  
 Bum Jun Kim, Hyeyeon Choi, Hyeonah Jang, Donggeon Lee, Sang Woo Kim  

  TL;DR:  In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply Dropout.   Abstract:   
 For the stable optimization of deep neural networks, regularization methods such as dropout and batch normalization have been used in various tasks. Nevertheless, the correct position to apply dropout has rarely been discussed, and different positions have been employed depending on the practitioners. In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply dropout. We demonstrate that for a residual network with batch normalization, applying dropout at certain positions increases the performance, whereas applying dropout at other positions decreases the performance. Based on theoretical analysis, we provide the following guideline for the correct position to apply dropout: apply one dropout after the last batch normalization but before the last weight layer in the residual branch. We provide detailed theoretical explanations to support this claim and demonstrate them through module tests. In addition, we investigate the correct position of dropout in the head that produces the final prediction. Although the current consensus is to apply dropout after global average pooling, we prove that applying dropout before global average pooling leads to a more stable output. The proposed guidelines are validated through experiments using different datasets and models.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  A generative/discriminative hybrid model effectively address the issue of performance degradation when the test samples come from new components for which no defective sample is available.   Abstract:   
 This paper presents a novel approach for detecting soldering defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) composed mainly of Surface Mount Technology (SMT) components, using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The main challenge addressed is the detection of soldering defects in new components for which only examples of good soldering are available at the model training phase. To meet industrial quality standards, we must keep the leakage rate (i.e., miss detection rate) low. To address this, we design the system to be "unknown-aware" with a low unknown rate and utilize the knowledge gained from the soldering examples of old components to detect the soldering defects of new components. We evaluated the method on a real-world dataset from an electronics company. It significantly reduces the leakage rate from 1.827\% $\pm$ 3.063\% to 0.063\% $\pm$ 0.075\% with an unknown rate of 3.706\% $\pm$ 2.270\%, compared to the baseline approach.

 Zhiwei Tang, Tsung-Hui Chang, Xiaojing Ye, Hongyuan Zha  

  TL;DR:  We formulate a new matrix recovery problem for addressing a common obstacle in utilizing heterogeneous data, and develop an efficient algorithm to solve it.   Abstract:   
 We study a matrix recovery problem with unknown correspondence: given the observation matrix $M_o=[A,\tilde P B]$, where $\tilde P$ is an unknown permutation matrix, we aim to recover the underlying matrix $M=[A,B]$. Such problem commonly arises in many applications where heterogeneous data are utilized and the correspondence among them are unknown, e.g., due to data mishandling or privacy concern. We show that, in some applications, it is possible to recover $M$ via solving a nuclear norm minimization problem. Moreover, under a proper low-rank condition on $M$, we derive a non-asymptotic error bound for the recovery of $M$. We propose an algorithm, $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ (Matrix recovery via Min-Max Optimization) which recasts this combinatorial problem as a continuous minimax optimization problem and solves it by proximal gradient with a Max-Oracle. $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ can also be applied to a more general scenario where we have missing entries in $M_o$ and multiple groups of data with distinct unknown correspondence. Experiments on simulated data, the MovieLens 100K dataset and Yale B database show that $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance over several baselines and can recover the ground-truth correspondence with high accuracy. 
 ID: 91 | Quasi-Bayesian Nonparametric Density Estimation via Autoregressive Predictive Updates   
 [spotlight]  
 Sahra Ghalebikesabi, Christopher C. Holmes, Edwin Fong, Brieuc Lehmann  

    Abstract:   
 Bayesian methods are a popular choice for statistical inference in small-data regimes due to the regularization effect induced by the prior. In the context of density estimation, the standard nonparametric Bayesian approach is to target the posterior predictive of the Dirichlet process mixture model. In general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable and so methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an intermediate step. The recent development of quasi-Bayesian predictive copula updates, however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density estimation without the need for posterior approximation. Although these estimators are computationally appealing, they tend to struggle on non-smooth data distributions. This is due to the comparatively restrictive form of the likelihood models from which the proposed copula updates were derived. To address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric model with an autoregressive likelihood decomposition and a Gaussian process prior. While the predictive update of such a model is typically intractable, we derive a quasi-Bayesian predictive update that achieves state-of-the-art results on moderate-sized examples.

  TL;DR:  We propose a physics-driven molecular representation learning method powered by self-supervised masked atomic modeling, and novel evaluation schemes to ensure reliability of the model in various ways.   Abstract:   
 Estimating the energetic properties of molecular systems is a critical task in material design. Machine learning has shown remarkable promise on this task over classical force-fields, but a fully data-driven approach suffers from limited labeled data; not just the amount of available data lacks, but the distribution of labeled examples is highly skewed to stable states. In this work, we propose a molecular representation learning method that extrapolates well beyond the training distribution, powered by physics-driven parameter estimation from classical energy equations and self-supervised learning inspired from masked language modeling. To ensure reliability of the proposed model, we introduce a series of novel evaluation schemes in multifaceted ways, beyond the energy or force accuracy that has been dominantly used. From extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in discovering molecular structures, outperforming other baselines. Furthermore, we extrapolate it to the chemical reaction pathways beyond stable states, taking a step towards physically reliable molecular representation learning. 
 ID: 100 | Nonconvex Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent and Generalized Eigenvector Problems   
  
 Chris Junchi Li, Michael Jordan  

    Abstract:   
 Motivated by the problem of online canonical correlation analysis, we propose the \emph{Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent} (SSGD) algorithm for minimizing the expectation of a stochastic function over a generic Riemannian manifold. SSGD generalizes the idea of projected stochastic gradient descent and allows the use of scaled stochastic gradients instead of stochastic gradients. In the special case of a spherical constraint, which arises in generalized eigenvector problems, we establish a nonasymptotic finite-sample bound of $\sqrt{1/T}$, and show that this rate is minimax optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor of relevant parameters. On the asymptotic side, a novel trajectory-averaging argument allows us to achieve local asymptotic normality with a rate that matches that of Ruppert-Polyak-Juditsky averaging. We bring these ideas together in an application to online canonical correlation analysis, deriving, for the first time in the literature, an optimal one-time-scale algorithm with an explicit rate of local asymptotic convergence to normality. Numerical studies of canonical correlation analysis are also provided for synthetic data. 
 ID: 105 | MDPose: Real-Time Multi-Person Pose Estimation via Mixture Density Model   
  
 Seunghyeon Seo, Jaeyoung Yoo, Jihye Hwang, Nojun Kwak  

  TL;DR:  We reformulate multi-person pose estimation task as a density estimation, enabling real-time instance-aware keypoint estimation without any additional instance identification process.   Abstract:   
 One of the major challenges in multi-person pose estimation is instance-aware keypoint estimation. Previous methods address this problem by leveraging an off-the-shelf detector, heuristic post-grouping process or explicit instance identification process, hindering further improvements in the inference speed which is an important factor for practical applications. From the statistical point of view, those additional processes for identifying instances are necessary to bypass learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints, which is a critical factor for another major challenge, the occlusion scenario. In this work, we propose a novel framework of single-stage instance-aware pose estimation by modeling the joint distribution of human keypoints with a mixture density model, termed as MDPose. Our MDPose estimates the distribution of human keypoints' coordinates using a mixture density model with an instance-aware keypoint head consisting simply of 8 convolutional layers. It is trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth keypoints. Also, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, Random Keypoint Grouping (RKG), which significantly alleviates the underflow problem leading to successful learning of relations between keypoints. On OCHuman dataset, which consists of images with highly occluded people, our MDPose achieves state-of-the-art performance by successfully learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints. Furthermore, our MDPose shows significant improvement in inference speed with a competitive accuracy on MS COCO, a widely-used human keypoint dataset, thanks to the proposed much simpler single-stage pipeline.

 Katharina Ott, Michael Tiemann, Philipp Hennig, Francois-Xavier Briol  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel architecture for neural networks for numerical integration based on the Stein operator with an approximation of the Bayesian posterior based on the Laplace approximation.   Abstract:   
 Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods for numerical integration offer significant advantages over their non-Bayesian counterparts: they can encode prior information about the integrand, and can quantify uncertainty over estimates of an integral. However, the most popular algorithm in this class, Bayesian quadrature, is based on Gaussian process models and is therefore associated with a high computational cost. To improve scalability, we propose an alternative approach based on Bayesian neural networks which we call Bayesian Stein networks. The key ingredients are a neural network architecture based on Stein operators, and an approximation of the Bayesian posterior based on the Laplace approximation. We show that this leads to orders of magnitude speed-ups on the popular Genz functions benchmark, and on challenging problems arising in the Bayesian analysis of dynamical systems, and the prediction of energy production for a large-scale wind farm.

 Duanxiao Song, Guangyuan Shen, Dehong Gao, libin yang, Xukai Zhou, Shirui Pan, Wei Lou, Fang Zhou  

    Abstract:   
 Client selection schemes are widely adopted to handle the communication-efficient problems in recent studies of Federated Learning (FL). However, the large variance of the model updates aggregated from the randomly-selected unrepresentative subsets directly slows the FL convergence. We present a novel clustering-based client selection scheme to accelerate the FL convergence by variance reduction. Simple yet effective schemes are designed to improve the clustering effect and control the effect fluctuation, therefore, generating the client subset with certain representativeness of sampling. Theoretically, we demonstrate the improvement of the proposed scheme in variance reduction. We also present the tighter convergence guarantee of the proposed method thanks to the variance reduction. Experimental results confirm the exceed efficiency of our scheme compared to alternatives.

  TL;DR:  We show that probabilistic circuits can be overconfident and not robust to out-of-distribution data, and we overcome this challenge by introducing a tractable sampling-free inference procedure to estimate model uncertainty.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are models that allow exact and tractable probabilistic inference. In contrast to neural networks, they are often assumed to be well-calibrated and robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we show that PCs are in fact not robust to OOD data, i.e., they don't know what they don't know. We then show how this challenge can be overcome by model uncertainty quantification. To this end, we propose tractable dropout inference (TDI), an inference procedure to estimate uncertainty by deriving an analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation. Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty estimates in a single forward pass. TDI improves the robustness of PCs to distribution shift and OOD data, demonstrated through a series of experiments evaluating the classification confidence and uncertainty estimates on real-world data.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Much research in deep learning is devoted to developing new model and training procedures. On the other hand, training objectives received much less attention and are often restricted to combinations of standard losses. When the objective aligns well with the evaluation metric, this is not a major issue. However when dealing with complex structured outputs, the ideal objective can be hard to optimize and the efficacy of usual objectives as a proxy for the true objective can be questionable. In this work, we argue that the existing inference network based structured prediction methods~\citep{tu-18, tu2020improving} are indirectly learning to optimize a dynamic loss objective parameterized by the energy model. We then explore using implicit-gradient based technique to learn the corresponding dynamic objectives. Our experiments show that implicitly learning a dynamic loss landscape is an effective method for improving model performance in structured prediction.

  TL;DR:  We propose a theory-driven improvement of Mixup, which is theoretically and empirically validated to be effective.   Abstract:   
 Mixup is a popular data augmentation technique for training deep neural networks where additional samples are generated by linearly interpolating pairs of inputs and their labels. This technique is known to improve the generalization performance in many learning paradigms and applications. In this work, we first analyze Mixup and show that it implicitly regularizes infinitely many directional derivatives of all orders. Based on this new insight, we propose an improved version of Mixup, theoretically justified to deliver better generalization performance than the vanilla Mixup. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments across various domains such as images, tabular data, speech, and graphs. Our results show that the proposed method improves Mixup across various datasets using a variety of architectures, for instance, exhibiting an improvement over Mixup by 0.8% in ImageNet top-1 accuracy.

  TL;DR:  We propose a contrastive whole-output explanation method for image classification.   Abstract:   
 Explanations for the outputs of deep neural network classifiers are essential in promoting trust and comprehension among users. Conventional methods often offer explanations only for one single class in the output and neglect other classes with high probabilities, resulting in a limited view of the model's behaviors. In this paper, we propose a holistic explanation method for image classification. It not only facilitates an overall understanding of model behavior, but also provides a framework where one can examine the evidence for discriminating competing classes, and thereby yield contrastive explanations. We demonstrate the advantages of the new method over baselines in terms of both faithfulness to the model and interpretability to users. The source code will be made available to the public upon publication of the paper.

  TL;DR:  Better joint predictions lead to better decisions in deep RL.   Abstract:   
 Thompson sampling (TS) is a popular heuristic for action selection, but it requires sampling from a posterior distribution. Unfortunately, this can become computationally intractable in complex environments, such as those modeled using neural networks. Approximate posterior samples can produce effective actions, but only if they reasonably approximate joint predictive distributions of outputs across inputs. Notably, accuracy of marginal predictive distributions does not suffice. Epistemic neural networks (ENNs) are designed to produce accurate joint predictive distributions. We compare a range of ENNs through computational experiments that assess their performance in approximating TS across bandit and reinforcement learning environments. The results indicate that ENNs serve this purpose well and illustrate how the quality of joint predictive distributions drives performance. Further, we demonstrate that the \textit{epinet} --- a small additive network that estimates uncertainty --- matches the performance of large ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. This enables effective application of TS with computation that scales gracefully to complex environments. 
 ID: 138 | Lifelong Bandit Optimization: No Prior and No Regret   
  
 Felix Schur, Parnian Kassraie, Jonas Rothfuss, Andreas Krause  

  TL;DR:  We meta-learn sparse kernels for lifelong optimization of linear bandits with oracle-optimal regret guarantee.   Abstract:   
 Machine learning algorithms are often repeatedly applied to problems with similar structure over and over again. We focus on solving a sequence of bandit optimization tasks and develop LIBO, an algorithm which adapts to the environment by learning from past experience and becomes more sample-efficient in the process. We assume a kernelized structure where the kernel is unknown but shared across all tasks. LIBO sequentially meta-learns a kernel that approximates the true kernel and solves the incoming tasks with the latest kernel estimate. Our algorithm can be paired with any kernelized or linear bandit algorithm and guarantees oracle optimal performance, meaning that as more tasks are solved, the regret of LIBO on each task converges to the regret of the bandit algorithm with oracle knowledge of the true kernel. Naturally, if paired with a sublinear bandit algorithm, LIBO yields a sublinear lifelong regret. We also show that direct access to the data from each task is not necessary for attaining sublinear regret. We propose F-LIBO, which solves the lifelong problem in a federated manner. 
 ID: 139 | Learning Nonlinear Causal Effect via Kernel Anchor Regression   
  
 Wenqi Shi, Wenkai Xu  

    Abstract:   
 Learning causal effects is a fundamental problem in science. Anchor regression has been developed to address this problem for a large class of causal graphical models, though the relationships between the variables are assumed to be linear. In this work, we tackle the nonlinear setting by proposing kernel anchor regression (KAR). Beyond a classic two-stage least square (2SLS) estimator, we also study an improved variant that involves nonparametric kernel regression in three separate stages. We provide convergence results for the proposed KAR estimators and the identifiability conditions for KAR to learn the nonlinear structural equation models (SEM). Experimental results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed KAR estimators over existing baselines.

  TL;DR:  We propose amortizing hyperparameter inference for GP's over the combined space of kernel structures and datasets.   Abstract:   
 Learning the kernel parameters for Gaussian processes is often the computational bottleneck in applications such as online learning, Bayesian optimization, or active learning. Amortizing parameter inference over different datasets is a promising approach to dramatically speed up training time. However, existing methods restrict the amortized inference procedure to a fixed kernel structure. The amortization network must be redesigned manually and trained again in case a different kernel is employed, which leads to a large overhead in design time and training time. We propose amortizing kernel parameter inference over a complete kernel-structure-family rather than a fixed kernel structure. We do that via defining an amortization network over pairs of datasets and kernel structures. This enables fast kernel inference for each element in the kernel family without retraining the amortization network. As a by-product, our amortization network is able to do fast ensembling over kernel structures. In our experiments, we show drastically reduced inference time combined with competitive test performance for a large set of kernels and datasets. 
 ID: 143 | Semi-supervised Learning of Partial Differential Operators and Dynamical Flows   
  
 Michael Rotman, Amit Dekel, Ran Ilan Ber, Lior Wolf, Yaron Oz  

    Abstract:   
 The evolution of many dynamical systems is generically governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), whose solution, in a simulation framework, requires vast amounts of computational resources. In this work, we present a novel method that combines a hyper-network solver with a Fourier Neural Operator architecture. Our method treats time and space separately and as a result, it successfully propagates initial conditions in continuous time steps by employing the general composition properties of the partial differential operators. Following previous works, supervision is provided at a specific time point. We test our method on various time evolution PDEs, including nonlinear fluid flows in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. The results show that the new method improves the learning accuracy at the time of the supervision point, and can interpolate the solutions to any intermediate time. 
 ID: 144 | Modified Retrace for Off-Policy Temporal Difference Learning   
  
 Xingguo Chen, Xingzhou Ma, Yang Li, Guang Yang, Shangdong Yang, Yang Gao  

  TL;DR:  We proposed modified retrace to measure the off-policyness between the target policy and the behavior policy, and obtained a convergence guarantee.   Abstract:   
 Off-policy learning is a key to extend reinforcement learning as it allows to learn a target policy from a different behavior policy that generates the data. However, it is well known as ``the deadly triad'' when combined with bootstrapping and function approximation. Retrace is an efficient and convergent off-policy algorithm with tabular value functions which employs truncated importance sampling ratios. Unfortunately, Retrace is known to be unstable with linear function approximation. In this paper, we propose modified Retrace to correct the off-policy return, derive a new off-policy temporal difference learning algorithm (TD-MRetrace) with linear function approximation, and obtain a convergence guarantee under standard assumptions in both prediction and control cases. Experimental results on counterexamples and control tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with traditional algorithms. 
 ID: 147 | Learning in Online MDPs: Is there a Price for Handling the Communicating Case?   
  
 Gautam Chandrasekaran, Ambuj Tewari  

  TL;DR:  We design a low regret online learning algorithm for communicating MDPs   Abstract:   
 It is a remarkable fact that the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret rate can be achieved in both the Experts Problem and the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit problem albeit with a worse dependence on number of actions in the latter case. In contrast, it has been shown that handling online MDPs with communicating structure and bandit information incurs $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ regret even in the case of deterministic transitions. Is this the price we pay for handling communicating structure or is it because we also have bandit feedback? In this paper we show that with full information, online MDPs can still be learned at an $O(\sqrt{T})$ rate even in the presence of communicating structure. We first show this by proposing an efficient follow the perturbed leader (FPL) algorithm for the deterministic transition case. We then extend our scope to consider stochastic transitions where we first give an inefficient $O(\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm (with a mild additional condition on the dynamics). Then we show how to achieve $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{T}{\alpha}}\right)$ regret rate using an oracle-efficient algorithm but with the additional restriction that the starting state distribution has mass at least $\alpha$ on each state.

    [link to video]  [slides]   
   
  TL;DR:  We examine the uncertainty deficit of Variational Inference when using a factorized Gaussian approximation.   Abstract:   
 When factorized approximations are used for variational inference (VI), they tend to understimate the uncertainty---as measured in various ways---of the distributions they are meant to approximate. We consider two popular ways to measure the uncertainty deficit of VI: (i) the degree to which it underestimates the componentwise variance, and (ii) the degree to which it underestimates the entropy. To better understand these effects, and the relationship between them, we examine an informative setting where they can be explicitly (and elegantly) analyzed: the approximation of a Gaussian,~$p$, with a dense covariance matrix, by a Gaussian,~$q$, with a diagonal covariance matrix. We prove that $q$ always underestimates both the componentwise variance and the entropy of $p$, \textit{though not necessarily to the same degree}. Moreover we demonstrate that the entropy of $q$ is determined by the trade-off of two competing forces: it is decreased by the shrinkage of its componentwise variances (our first measure of uncertainty) but it is increased by the factorized approximation which delinks the nodes in the graphical model of $p$. We study various manifestations of this trade-off, notably one where, as the dimension of the problem grows, the per-component entropy gap between $p$ and $q$ becomes vanishingly small even though $q$ underestimates every componentwise variance by a constant multiplicative factor. We also use the shrinkage-delinkage trade-off to bound the entropy gap in terms of the problem dimension and the condition number of the correlation matrix of $p$. Finally we present empirical results on both Gaussian and non-Gaussian targets, the former to validate our analysis and the latter to explore its limitations. 
 ID: 150 | Mixture of Normalizing Flows for European Option Pricing   
  
 Yongxin Yang, Timothy Hospedales  

    Abstract:   
 We present a mixture of normalizing flows (MoNF) approach to European option pricing with guarantees that its estimations are free from static arbitrage. In contrast to many existing methods that meet economic rationality constraints (e.g., non-arbitrage) by introducing auxiliary losses, our solution meets those constraints exactly by design. To achieve this, we propose to build a model for risk neutral density using normalizing flows, which results in a pricing model, instead of modelling the option pricing function directly. First, we convert the constraints for the direct pricing models to the constraints for models backed by risk neutral density estimation, then we design a specific NF architecture that meets these constraints. Furthermore, we find that employing a mixture of such normalizing flows improves the performance significantly, compared to using a deeper single NF. Finally, we present a mechanism to regularise the proposed model, and this regularisation can serve as a bridge between our method and any sample-based mathematical finance method. The evaluations on five option datasets show superiority of our method compared to mathematical finance solutions and some other neural networks based methods.

 Hanyu Peng, Guanhua Fang, Ping Li  

  TL;DR:  Towards an end-to-end feature selection with copula to explore feature correlation   Abstract:   
 Instance-wise feature selection and ranking methods can achieve a good selection of task-friendly features for each sample in the context of neural networks. However, existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be independent are imperfect when considering the dependency between features. To address this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a powerful mathematical technique for capturing correlations between variables, into the current feature selection framework with no additional changes needed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, in terms of performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing meaningful correlations.

    Abstract:   
 Imbalanced data is ubiquitous in machine learning, such as medical or fine-grained image datasets. The existing continual learning methods employ various techniques such as balanced sampling to improve classification accuracy in this setting. However, classification accuracy is not a suitable metric for imbalanced data, and hence these methods may not obtain a good classifier as measured by other metrics (e.g., Area under the ROC Curve). In this paper, we propose a solution to enable efficient imbalanced continual learning by designing an algorithm to effectively maximize one widely used metric in an imbalanced data setting: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We find that simply replacing accuracy with AUC will cause \textit{gradient interference problem} due to the imbalanced data distribution. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm, namely DIANA, which performs a novel synthesis of model \underline{D}ecoupl\underline{I}ng \underline{AN}d \underline{A}lignment. In particular, the algorithm updates two models simultaneously: one focuses on learning the current knowledge while the other concentrates on reviewing previously-learned knowledge, and the two models gradually align during training.The results show that DIANA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the imbalanced datasets.

  TL;DR:  A new framework Fastap to handle the situation where the teammates policy suffer from sudden change within one episode in cooperative MARL.   Abstract:   
 In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where an agent coordinates with teammate(s) for a shared goal, it may sustain non-stationary caused by the policy change of teammates. Prior works mainly concentrate on the policy change during the training phase or teammates altering cross episodes, ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from policy change suddenly within an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance as a result. We formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some agents to coordinate with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be changed within one episode. Then we develop a new framework Fast teammates adaptation (Fastap) to address the problem. Concretely, we first train versatile teammates' policies and assign them to different clusters via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to coordinate with the sampled uncontrolled teammates by capturing their identifications as context for fast adaptation. Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates' context for decision-making accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a robust policy that can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution phase. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior performance than multiple baselines in stationary and non-stationary scenarios. 
 ID: 184 | Noisy Adversarial Representation Learning for Effective and Efficient Image Obfuscation   
  
 Jonghu Jeong, Minyong Cho, Philipp Benz, Tae-hoon Kim  

  TL;DR:  To protect users privacy in machine learning as a service, we introduce an effective and efficient adversarial representation learning method with simple noisy features.   Abstract:   
 Recent real-world applications of deep learning have led to the development of machine learning as a service (MLaaS). However, the scenario of client-server inference presents privacy concerns, where the server processes raw data sent from the user's client device. One solution to this issue is to provide an obfuscator function to the client device using Adversarial Representation Learning (ARL). Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy-utility trade-off while overlooking the computational cost and memory burden on the client side. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient ARL method that incorporates feature noise into the ARL pipeline. We evaluated our approach on various datasets, comparing it with state-of-the-art ARL techniques. Our experimental results indicate that our method achieves better accuracy, lower computation and memory overheads, and improved resistance to information leakage and reconstruction attacks. The code is available in the supplementary and will be made public after publication.

  TL;DR:  Through a proper proposal distribution, one can efficiently and tractably marginalize out missing information in marked temporal point processes, thus allowing for accommodating partially observed sequences.   Abstract:   
 Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are a general class of stochastic models for modeling the evolution of events of different types (``marks'') in continuous time. These models have broad applications in areas such as medical data monitoring, financial prediction, user modeling, and communication networks. Of significant practical interest in such problems is the issue of missing or censored data over time. In this paper, we focus on the specific problem of inference for a trained MTPP model when events of certain types are not observed over a period of time during prediction. We introduce the concept of mark-censored sub-processes and use this framework to develop a novel marginalization technique for inference in the presence of censored marks. The approach is model-agnostic and applicable to any MTPP model with a well-defined intensity function. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the method in the context of both parametric and neural MTPP models, with results across a range of datasets including data from simulated Hawkes processes, self-correcting processes, and multiple real-world event datasets. 
 ID: 189 | Transfer Learning for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation   
  
 Ahmed Aloui, Juncheng Dong, Cat Phuoc Le, Vahid Tarokh  

  TL;DR:  This work presents theoretical and empirical studies about estimating individual treatment effect using knowledge transfer from the previous experience.   Abstract:   
 This work considers the problem of transferring causal knowledge between tasks for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation. To this end, we theoretically assess the feasibility of transferring ITE knowledge and present a practical framework for efficient transfer. A lower bound is introduced on the ITE error of the target task to demonstrate that ITE knowledge transfer is challenging due to the absence of counterfactual information. Nevertheless, we establish generalization upper bounds on the counterfactual loss and ITE error of the target task, demonstrating the feasibility of ITE knowledge transfer. Subsequently, we introduce a framework with a new Causal Inference Task Affinity (CITA) measure for ITE knowledge transfer. Specifically, we use CITA to find the closest source task to the target task and utilize it for ITE knowledge transfer. Empirical studies are provided, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method. We observe that ITE knowledge transfer can significantly (up to 95%) reduce the amount of data required for ITE estimation.

 [spotlight]

    Abstract:   
 Identifying the causes of an event, also termed as causal attribution, is a commonly encountered task in many application problems. Available methods, mostly in Bayesian or causal inference literature, suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) cannot attributing for individuals, (2) attributing one single cause at a time and cannot deal with the interaction effect among multiple causes. In this paper, based on our proposed new measurement, called conditional counterfactual causality effect (CCCE), we introduce an individual causal attribution method, which is able to utilize the individual observation as the evidence and consider common influence and interaction effect of multiple causes simultaneously. We discuss the identifiability of CCCE and also give the identification formulas under proper assumptions. Finally, we conduct experiments on simulated and real data to illustrate the effectiveness of CCCE and the results show that our proposed method outperforms significantly over state-of-the-art methods.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We provide the better rates for variance reduced random reshuffling methods.   Abstract:   
 Virtually all state-of-the-art methods for training supervised machine learning models are variants of SGD, enhanced with a number of additional tricks, such as minibatching, momentum, and adaptive stepsizes. However, one of the most basic questions in the design of successful SGD methods, one that is orthogonal to the aforementioned tricks, is the choice of the next training data point to be learning from. Standard variants of SGD employ a sampling with replacement strategy, which means that the next training data point is sampled from the entire data set, often independently of all previous samples. While standard SGD is well understood theoretically, virtually all widely used machine learning software is based on sampling without replacement as this is often empirically superior. That is, the training data is randomly shuffled/permuted, either only once at the beginning, strategy known as random shuffling (RS), or before every epoch, strategy known as random reshuffling (RR), and training proceeds in the data order dictated by the shuffling. RS and RR strategies have for a long time remained beyond the reach of theoretical analysis that would satisfactorily explain their success. However, very recently, Mishchenko et al. [2020] provided tight sublinear convergence rates through a novel analysis, and showed that these strategies can improve upon standard SGD in certain regimes. Inspired by these results, we seek to further improve the rates of shuffling-based methods. In particular, we show that it is possible to enhance them with a variance reduction mechanism, obtaining linear convergence rates. To the best of our knowledge, our linear convergence rates are the best for any method based on sampling without replacement. 
 ID: 205 | A Bayesian Approach for Bandit Online Optimization with Switching Cost   
  
 Zai Shi, Jian Tan, Feifei Li  

    Abstract:   
 As a classical problem, online optimization with switching cost has been studied for a long time due to its wide applications in various areas. However, few works have investigated the bandit setting where both the forms of the main cost function $f(x)$ evaluated at state $x$ and the switching cost function $c(x, y)$ of transitioning from state $x$ to $y$ are unknown. In this paper, we consider the situation when $\left(f(x_t)+\varepsilon_t,\, c(x_t, x_{t-1})\right)$ can be observed with noise $\varepsilon_t$ after making a decision $x_t$ at time $t$, aiming to minimize the expected total cost within a time horizon. To solve this problem, we propose two algorithms from a Bayesian approach, named Greedy Search and Alternating Search, respectively. They have different theoretical guarantees of competitive ratios under mild regularity conditions, and the latter algorithm achieves a faster running speed. Using simulations of two classical black-box optimization problems, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared with the classical method.

  TL;DR:  We study the impact of context inference error and partial observability on policy learning for adaptive health interventions.   Abstract:   
 Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are a class of personalized health interventions developed within the behavioral science community. JITAIs aim to provide the right type and amount of support by iteratively selecting a sequence of intervention options from a pre-defined set of components in response to each individual's time varying state. In this work, we explore the application of reinforcement learning methods to the problem of learning intervention option selection policies. We study the effect of context inference error and partial observability on the ability to learn effective policies. Our results show that the propagation of uncertainty from context inferences is critical to improving intervention efficacy as context uncertainty increases, while policy gradient algorithms can provide remarkable robustness to partially observed behavioral state information. 
 ID: 212 | Monte-Carlo Search for an Equilibrium in Dec-POMDPs   
  
 YANG YOU, Vincent Thomas, Francis Colas, Olivier Buffet  

    Abstract:   
 Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) formalize the problem of designing individual controllers for a group of collaborative agents under stochastic dynamics and partial observability. Seeking a global optimum is difficult (NEXP complete), but seeking a Nash equilibrium ‚Äî each agent policy being a best response to the other agents ‚Äî is more accessible, and allowed addressing infinite-horizon problems with solutions in the form of finite state controllers. In this paper, we show that this approach can be adapted to cases where only a generative model (a simulator) of the Dec-POMDP is available. This requires relying on a simulation-based POMDP solver to construct an agent‚Äôs FSC node by node. A related process is used to heuristically derive initial FSCs. Experiment with benchmarks shows that MC-JESP is competitive with existing Dec-POMDP solvers, even better than many offline methods using explicit models. 
 ID: 213 | Benign Overfitting in Adversarially Robust Linear Classification   
  
 Jinghui Chen, Yuan Cao, Quanquan Gu  

    Abstract:   
 ``Benign overfitting'', where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series of works have provided theoretical justification for over-parameterized linear regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if benign overfitting can occur in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e., examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples, on subGaussian mixture data. In detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations. Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks, despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. 
 ID: 214 | Solving Multi-Model MDPs by Policy Gradient and Dynamic Programming   
  
 Xihong Su, Marek Petrik  

    Abstract:   
 Multi-model Markov decision process(MMDP) is a promising framework for computing policies that are robust to parameter uncertainty in MDPs. MMDPs aim to find a policy that maximizes the expected return over a distribution of MDP models. Because MMDPs are NP-hard to solve, most methods resort to approximations. In this paper, we derive the policy gradient of MMDPs and propose CADP, which combines a coordinate ascent method and a dynamic programming algorithm for solving MMDPs. The main innovation of CADP compared with earlier algorithms is to take the policy gradient perspective to adjust model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy improvements to a local maximum. A theoretical analysis of CADP proves that it never performs worse than previous dynamic programming algorithms like WSU. Our numerical results indicate that CADP substantially outperforms existing methods on several benchmark problems.

  TL;DR:  We develop a method for drawing exponentially many samples of latent variables for use in Reweighted wake-sleep.   Abstract:   
 Reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) is a machine learning method for performing Bayesian inference in a very general class of models. RWS draws $K$ samples from an underlying approximate posterior, then uses importance weighting to provide a better estimates of the true posterior. RWS then updates its approximate posterior towards the importance-weighted estimate of the true posterior. However, recent work (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018) indicates that the number of samples required for effective importance weighting is $\mathcal{O}(e^n)$, where $n$ is the number of latent variables. Attaining such a large number of importance samples is intractable in all but the smallest models. Here, we develop massively parallel RWS, which circumvents this issue by drawing $K$ samples of all $n$ latent variables, and individually reasoning about all $K^n$ possible combinations of samples. While reasoning about $K^n$ combinations might seem intractable, the required computations can be performed in polynomial time by exploiting conditional independencies in the generative model. We show considerable improvements over standard "global" RWS, which draws $K$ samples from the full joint.

  TL;DR:  A novel Deep Offline Reinforcement learning Negotiating Agent (DOREA) framework can learn a strategy from offline dataset and adapt it to opponent changes.   Abstract:   
 Learning is crucial for automated negotiation, and recent years have witnessed a remarkable achievement in application of reinforcement learning (RL) for various negotiation tasks. Conventional RL methods focus generally on learning from active interactions with opposing negotiators. However, collecting online data is expensive in many realistic negotiation scenarios. While previous studies partially mitigate this problem through the use of opponent simulators (i.e., agents following known strategies), in reality it is usually hard to fully capture an opponent‚Äôs negotiation strategy. Moreover, a further challenge lies in an agent's capability of adapting to dynamic variations of an opponent‚Äôs preferences or strategy, which may happen from time to time for different reasons in subsequent negotiations. In response to these challenges, this article proposes a novel Deep Offline Reinforcement learning Negotiating Agent (DOREA) framework that allows to learn an effective strategy using previously collected negotiation datasets without requiring interaction with an opponent. This is in contrast to existing RL-based negotiation approaches that all rely on active interaction with opponents. Furthermore, the strategy fine-tuning mechanism is included to adjust the learned strategy in response to the preferences or strategy changes of the opponent. The performance of the DOREA framework is evaluated based on a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines under different settings. Experimental results show that the proposed framework allows to learn effective strategies exclusively with offline datasets, and is also capable of effectively adapting to changes of an opponent's negotiation preferences or strategy.

 Idan Achituve, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya  

  TL;DR:  To remedy the overfitting issues in deep kernels, we propose utilizing infinite-width neural networks to guide their optimization process and retain their Bayesian merits.   Abstract:   
 Combining Gaussian processes with the expressive power of deep neural networks is commonly done nowadays through deep kernel learning (DKL). Unfortunately, due to the kernel optimization process, this often results in losing their Bayesian benefits. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning deep kernels by utilizing infinite-width neural networks. We propose to use the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) model as a guide to the DKL model in the optimization process. Our approach harnesses the reliable uncertainty estimation of the NNGPs to adapt the DKL target confidence when it encounters novel data points. As a result, we get the best of both worlds, we leverage the Bayesian behavior of the NNGP, namely its robustness to overfitting, and accurate uncertainty estimation, while maintaining the generalization abilities, scalability, and flexibility of deep kernels. Empirically, we show on multiple benchmark datasets of varying sizes and dimensionality, that our method is robust to overfitting, has good predictive performance, and provides reliable uncertainty estimations.

  TL;DR:  We introduce a new single-object geospatial tracking dataset from a distributed camera network and present a modeling framework that considers uncertainties for this task.   Abstract:   
 Visual object tracking has seen significant progress in recent years. However, the vast majority of this work focuses on tracking objects within the image plane of a single camera and ignores the uncertainty associated with predicted object locations. In this work, we focus on the geospatial object tracking problem using data from a distributed camera network. The goal is to predict an object's track in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object's location while respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data. We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable tracker affect performance.

  TL;DR:  A multi-view graph contrasting learning (MVGCL) approach to tackle out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) issue in routing problem, which couples a graph pattern learner in a self-supervised fashion with deep reinforcement learning.   Abstract:   
 Recently, neural heuristics based on deep learning have reported encouraging results for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) instances, e.g. uniform. However, in the presence of a distribution shift for the testing instances, their performance becomes considerably inferior. In this paper, we propose a multi-view graph Contrastive learning (MVGCL) approach to enhance the generalization across different distributions, which exploits two graph pattern learners in a self-supervised fashion to facilitate a neural heuristic equipped with an active search scheme. Specifically, we first propose two augmentation methods that are specially designed for routing problems, and our MVGCL leverages graph contrastive learning to extract transferable patterns from VRP graphs to attain the generalizable multi-view (i.e. node and graph) representation. Then it adopts the learnt node embedding and graph embedding to assist the neural heuristic and the active search (during inference) for route construction, respectively. Extensive experiments on randomly generated VRP instances from various distributions, and the ones from TSPLib and CVRPLib show that our MVGCL is superior to the baselines in boosting the cross-distribution generalization performance.

  TL;DR:  DeepSeaProbLog: a neural probabilistic logic programming language with discrete and continuous random variables.   Abstract:   
 Neural-symbolic AI (NeSy) allows neural networks to exploit symbolic background knowledge in the form of logic. It has been shown to aid learning in the limited data regime and to facilitate inference on out-of-distribution data. Probabilistic NeSy focuses on integrating neural networks with both logic and probability theory, which additionally allows learning under uncertainty. A major limitation of current probabilistic NeSy systems, such as DeepProbLog, is their restriction to finite probability distributions, i.e., discrete random vari- ables. In contrast, deep probabilistic programming (DPP) excels in modelling and optimising continuous probability distributions. Hence, we introduce DeepSeaProbLog, a neural probabilistic logic programming language that incorporates DPP techniques into NeSy. Doing so results in the support of inference and learning of both discrete and continuous probability distributions under logical constraints. Our main contributions are 1) the semantics of DeepSeaProbLog and its corresponding inference algorithm, 2) a proven asymptotically unbiased learning algorithm, and 3) a series of experiments that illustrate the versatility of our approach.

  TL;DR:  We consider a generalization of stochastic dominance to handle data with non-standard scale of measurement and introduce corresponding (regularized and/or robustified) statistical tests.   Abstract:   
 Spaces with locally varying scale of measurement, like multidimensional structures with differently scaled dimensions, are pretty common in statistics and machine learning. Nevertheless, it is still understood as an open question how to exploit the entire information encoded in them properly. We address this problem by considering an order based on (sets of) expectations of random variables mapping into such non-standard spaces. This order contains stochastic dominance and expectation order as extreme cases when no, or respectively perfect, cardinal structure is given. We derive a (regularized) statistical test for such generalized stochastic dominance, operationalize it by linear optimization, and robustify it by imprecise probability models. Our findings are illustrated with data from multidimensional poverty measurement, finance, and medicine. 
 ID: 235 | On the Limitations of Markovian Rewards to Express Multi-Objective, Risk-Sensitive, and Modal Tasks   
  
 Joar Max Viktor Skalse, Alessandro Abate  

  TL;DR:  We study three classes of tasks (multi-objective tasks, risk-sensitive tasks, and modal tasks), and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when these tasks can be expressed using scalar, Markovian reward functions.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we study the expressivity of scalar, Markovian reward functions in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and identify several limitations to what they can express. Specifically, we look at three classes of RL tasks (multi-objective RL, risk-sensitive RL, and modal RL), and show that most of the instances in each of these three classes cannot be expressed using scalar, Markovian rewards. Among these three classes, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a problem can be reduced to ordinary, scalar reward reinforcement learning. Modal problems have so far not been given any systematic treatment in the RL literature; we thus call attention to them as a new class of problems. Finally, we also show that many of these problems can be solved by means of bespoke RL approaches: this rules out the possibility that those problems that cannot be expressed using Markovian reward functions also are impossible to learn effectively. 
 ID: 236 | Generating Synthetic Datasets by Interpolating along Generalized Geodesics   
  
 Jiaojiao Fan, David Alvarez-Melis  

  TL;DR:  We generate synthetic datasets by interpolating along generalized geodesics, so as to improve the transfer learning performance.   Abstract:   
 Data for pretraining machine learning models often consists of collections of heterogeneous datasets. Although training on their union is reasonable in agnostic settings, it might be suboptimal when the target domain ---where the model will ultimately be used--- is known in advance. In that case, one would ideally pretrain only on the dataset(s) most similar to the target one. Instead of limiting this choice to those datasets already present in the pretraining collection, here we explore extending this search to all datasets that can be synthesized as `combinations' of them. We define such combinations as multi-dataset interpolations, formalized through the notion of generalized geodesics from optimal transport (OT) theory. We compute these geodesics using a recent notion of distance between labeled datasets, and derive alternative interpolation schemes based on it: using either barycentric projections or optimal transport maps, the latter computed using recent neural OT methods. These methods are scalable, efficient, and ---notably--- can be used to interpolate even between datasets with distinct and unrelated label sets. Through various experiments in transfer learning in computer vision, we demonstrate this is a promising new approach for targeted on-demand dataset synthesis. 
 ID: 240 | Multi-modal Differentiable Unsupervised Feature Selection   
  
 Junchen Yang, Ofir Lindenbaum, Yuval Kluger, Ariel Jaffe  

    Abstract:   
 Multi-modal high throughput biological data presents a great scientific opportunity and a significant computational challenge. In multi-modal measurements, every sample is observed simultaneously by two or more sets of sensors. In such settings, many observed variables in both modalities are often nuisance and do not carry information about the phenomenon of interest. Here, we propose a multi-modal unsupervised feature selection framework: identifying informative variables based on coupled high-dimensional measurements. Our method is designed to identify features associated with two types of latent low-dimensional structures: (i) shared structures that govern the observations in both modalities, and (ii) differential structures that appear in only one modality. To that end, we propose two Laplacian-based scoring operators. We incorporate the scores with differentiable gates that mask nuisance features and enhance the accuracy of the structure captured by the graph Laplacian. The performance of the new scheme is illustrated using synthetic and real datasets, including an extended biological application to single-cell multi-omics.

  TL;DR:  Efficient private stochastic nonconvex optimization algorithm with improved utility guarantees   Abstract:   
 While many solutions for privacy-preserving convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) have been developed, privacy-preserving nonconvex ERM remains a challenge. We study nonconvex ERM, which takes the form of minimizing a finite-sum of nonconvex loss functions over a training set. We propose a new differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm for nonconvex ERM that achieves strong privacy guarantees efficiently, and provide a tight analysis of its privacy and utility guarantees, as well as its gradient complexity. Our algorithm reduces gradient complexity while matching the best-known utility guarantee. Our experiments on benchmark nonconvex ERM problems demonstrate superior performance in terms of both training cost and utility gains compared with previous differentially private methods using the same privacy budgets. 
 ID: 246 | Two-stage Kernel Bayesian Optimization in High Dimensions   
  
 Jian Tan, Niv Nayman  

    Abstract:   
 Bayesian optimization is a popular method for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Yet it oftentimes struggles in high dimensions, where the computation could be prohibitively heavy. While a complex kernel with many length scales is prone to overfitting and expensive to train, a simple coarse kernel with too few length scales cannot effectively capture the variations of the high dimensional function in different directions. To alleviate this problem, we introduce CobBO: a Bayesian optimization algorithm with two-stage kernels and a coordinate backoff stopping rule. It adaptively selects a promising low dimensional subspace and projects past measurements into it using a computational efficient coarse kernel. Within the subspace, the computational cost of conducting Bayesian optimization with a more flexible and accurate kernel becomes affordable and thus a sequence of consecutive observations in the same subspace are collected until a stopping rule is met. Extensive evaluations show that CobBO finds solutions comparable to or better than other state-of-the-art methods for dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds, while reducing both the trial complexity and computational costs.

 Cuong N. Nguyen, Phong Tran, Lam Si Tung Ho, Vu C. Dinh, Anh Tuan Tran, Tal Hassner, Cuong V Nguyen  

    Abstract:   
 We consider transferability estimation, the problem of estimating how well deep learning models transfer from a source to a target task. We focus on regression tasks, which received little previous attention, and propose two simple and computationally efficient approaches that estimate transferability based on the negative regularized mean squared error of a linear regression model. We prove novel theoretical results connecting our approaches to the actual transferability of the optimal target models obtained from the transfer learning process. Despite their simplicity, our approaches significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression transferability estimators in both accuracy and efficiency. On two large-scale keypoint regression benchmarks, our approaches yield 9% to 26% better results on average while being at least 27% faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

  TL;DR:  We bound the estimated causal effects of continuous-valued treatments when they might be biased by hidden confounders.   Abstract:   
 Inferring causal effects of continuous-valued treatments from observational data is a crucial task promising to better inform policy- and decision-makers. A critical assumption needed to identify these effects is that all confounding variables---causal parents of both the treatment and the outcome---are included as covariates. Unfortunately, given observational data alone, we cannot know with certainty that this criterion is satisfied. Sensitivity analyses provide principled ways to give bounds on causal estimates when confounding variables are hidden. While much attention is focused on sensitivity analyses for discrete-valued treatments, much less is paid to continuous-valued treatments. We present novel methodology to bound both average and conditional average continuous-valued treatment-effect estimates when they cannot be point identified due to hidden confounding. A semi-synthetic benchmark on multiple datasets shows our method giving tighter coverage of the true dose-response curve than a recently proposed continuous sensitivity model and baselines. Finally, we apply our method to a real-world observational case study to demonstrate the value of identifying dose-dependent causal effects. 
 ID: 250 | Accelerating Voting by Quantum Computation   
  
 Ao Liu, Qishen Han, Lirong Xia, Nengkun Yu  

  TL;DR:  We accelerate voting by leveraging quantum computing.   Abstract:   
 Studying the computational complexity of determining winners under voting rules and designing fast algorithms are classical and fundamental questions in computational social choice. In this paper, we accelerate voting by leveraging quantum computing. We propose a quantum voting algorithm that can be applied to any anonymous voting rule. We further show that our algorithm can be quadratically faster than any classical sampling algorithm under a wide range of common voting rules, including plurality, Borda, Copeland, and STV. Precisely, our quantum voting algorithm achieves an accuracy of at least $1 - \varepsilon$ with runtime $\Theta\left(\frac{n\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\text{MOV}}\right)$, where $n$ is the number of votes and $\text{MOV}$ is margin of victory, the smallest number of voters to change the winner. On the other hand, any classical voting algorithm based on sampling a subset of voting achieves the same accuracy with runtime $\Theta\left(\frac{n^2\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\text{MOV}^2}\right)$ [Bhattacharyya and Dey, 2021]. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments under the plurality and Borda rule. 
 ID: 251 | Merging Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graph   
  
 Tengfei Ma, Trong Nghia Hoang, Jie Chen  

  TL;DR:  We develop a new representation consensus technique that helps combining pre-trained models with different feature spaces.   Abstract:   
 Learning an effective global model on private and decentralized datasets has become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied in practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning, enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling homogeneity and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to many practical scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous sensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to use different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore happens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve consensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion approach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates them into a global representation that improves the prediction performance. Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to learn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction. This paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in real-world applications such as power grids and traffic networks. 
 ID: 255 | Posterior Sampling-based Online Learning for the Stochastic Shortest Path Model   
  
 Mehdi Jafarnia-Jahromi, Liyu Chen, Rahul Jain, Haipeng Luo  

  TL;DR:  The first posterior sampling algorithm for online learning in stochastic shortest path models with near-optimal regret and excellent empirical performance   Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of online reinforcement learning for the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem modeled as an unknown MDP with an absorbing state. We propose \ssp, a simple posterior sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm for the SSP problem. The algorithm operates in epochs. At the beginning of each epoch, a sample is drawn from the posterior distribution on the unknown model dynamics, and the optimal policy with respect to the drawn sample is followed during that epoch. An epoch completes if either the number of visits to the goal state in the current epoch exceeds that of the previous epoch, or the number of visits to any of the state-action pairs is doubled. We establish a Bayesian regret bound of $\tilde{O}(B S\sqrt{AK})$, where $B$ is an upper bound on the expected cost of the optimal policy, $S$ is the size of the state space, $A$ is the size of the action space, and $K$ is the number of episodes. The algorithm only requires the knowledge of the prior distribution, and has no hyper-parameters to tune. It is the first such posterior sampling algorithm and outperforms numerically previously proposed optimism-based algorithms.

  TL;DR:  Synthetic labels used in mixup are not consistently aligned with human perceptual judgments; relabeling examples, with humans-in-the-loop and leveraging human uncertainty information, holds promise to increase downstream model reliability.   Abstract:   
 Aligning model representations to humans has been found to improve robustness and generalization. However, such methods often focus on standard observational data. Synthetic data is proliferating and powering many advances in machine learning; yet, it is not always clear whether synthetic labels are perceptually aligned to humans -- rendering it likely model representations are not human aligned. We focus on the synthetic data used in mixup: a powerful regularizer shown to improve model robustness, generalization, and calibration. We design a comprehensive series of elicitation interfaces, which we release as HILL MixE Suite, and recruit 159 participants to provide perceptual judgments along with their uncertainties, over mixup examples. We find that human perceptions do not consistently align with the labels traditionally used for synthetic points, and begin to demonstrate the applicability of these findings to potentially increase the reliability of downstream models, particularly when incorporating human uncertainty. We release all elicited judgments in a new data hub we call H-Mix.

  TL;DR:  This paper introduces RPOSST, an algorithm for composing efficient, robust, reusable tests of candidate deployment RL policies by selecting a small number of the most useful test cases.   Abstract:   
 Modern reinforcement learning systems produce many high-quality policies throughout the learning process. However, to choose which policy to actually deploy in the real world, they must be tested under an intractable number of environmental conditions. We introduce RPOSST, an algorithm to select a small set of test cases from a larger pool based on a relatively small number of sample evaluations. RPOSST treats the test case selection problem as a 2-player game and optimizes a solution with provable $k$-of-$N$ robustness, bounding the error relative to a test that used all the test cases in the pool. Empirical results demonstrate that RPOSST finds a small set of test cases that identify high quality policies in a toy one-shot game, poker datasets, and a high-fidelity racing simulator.

 [spotlight]

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we analyse the effect of the convolution operator on the embedding geometry.   Abstract:   
 By recursively summing node features over entire neighborhoods, spatial graph convolution operators have been heralded as key to the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Yet, despite the multiplication of GNN methods across tasks and applications, the effect of this aggregation operation has yet to be analyzed. In fact, while most recent efforts in the GNN community have focused on optimizing the architecture of the neural network, fewer works have attempted to characterize (a) the different classes of spatial convolution operators, (b) their impact on the geometry of the embedding space, and (c) how the choice of a particular convolution should relate to properties of the data. In this paper, we propose to answer all three questions by dividing existing operators into two main classes (symmetrized vs. row-normalized spatial convolutions), and show how these correspond to different implicit biases on the data. Finally, we show that this convolution operator is in fact tunable, and explicit regimes in which certain choices of convolutions --- and therefore, embedding geometries --- might be more appropriate.

  TL;DR:  We formulated the ordinal classification task in the conformal risk control framework, provided theoretic risk bounds, proposed two types of loss functions, developed corresponding algorithms, and evaluated the method on 3 datasets.   Abstract:   
 As a natural extension to the standard conformal prediction method, several conformal risk control methods have been recently developed and applied to various learning problems. In this work, we seek to control the conformal risk in expectation for ordinal classification tasks, which have broad applications to many real problems. For this purpose, we firstly formulated the ordinal classification task in the conformal risk control framework, and provided theoretic risk bounds of the risk control method. Then we proposed two types of loss functions specially designed for ordinal classification tasks, and developed corresponding algorithms to determine the prediction set for each case to control their risks at a desired level. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and analyzed the difference between the two types of risks on three different datasets, including a simulated dataset, the UTKFace dataset and the diabetic retinopathy detection dataset.

 We provide an intuitive new algorithm for blackbox stochastic optimization of unimodal functions, a function class that we observe empirically can capture hyperparameter-tuning loss surfaces. Our method's convergence guarantee automatically adapts to Lipschitz constants and other problem difficulty parameters, recovering and extending prior results. We complement our theoretical development with experimental validation on hyperparameter tuning tasks. 
 ID: 273 | Adaptive Conditional Quantile Neural Processes   
  
 Peiman Mohseni, Nick Duffield, Bani Mallick, Arman Hasanzadeh  

    Abstract:   
 Neural processes are a family of probabilistic models that inherit the flexibility of neural networks to parameterize stochastic processes. Despite providing well-calibrated predictions, especially in regression problems, and quick adaptation to new tasks, the Gaussian assumption that is commonly used to represent the predictive likelihood fails to capture more complicated distributions such as multimodal ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Conditional Quantile Neural Processes (CQNPs), a new member of the neural processes family, which exploits the attractive properties of quantile regression in modeling the distributions irrespective of their form. By introducing an extension of quantile regression where the model learns to focus on estimating informative quantiles, we show that the sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy can be further enhanced. Our experiments with real and synthetic datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in predictive performance compared to the baselines, and better modeling of heterogeneous distributions' characteristics such as multimodality.

  TL;DR:  Development of event sampling algorithm allowing implementation of PDMP samplers for Bayesian neural networks.   Abstract:   
 Inference on modern Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often relies on a variational inference treatment, imposing violated assumptions of independence and the form of the posterior. Traditional MCMC approaches avoid these assumptions at the cost of increased computation due to its incompatibility to subsampling of the likelihood. New Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) samplers permit subsampling, though introduce a model specific inhomogenous Poisson Process (IPPs) which is difficult to sample from. This work introduces a new generic and adaptive thinning scheme for sampling from these IPPs, and demonstrates how this approach can accelerate the application of PDMPs for inference in BNNs. Experimentation illustrates how inference with these methods is computationally feasible, can improve predictive accuracy, MCMC mixing performance, and provide informative uncertainty measurements when compared against other approximate inference schemes.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm (PERIL) for knowledge-based SDM that learns from interaction experience to reason about contextual knowledge.   Abstract:   
 Sequential decision-making (SDM) methods enable AI agents to compute an action policy toward achieving long-term goals under uncertainty. Existing research has shown that contextual knowledge in declarative forms can be used for improving the performance of SDM methods. However, the contextual knowledge from people tends to be incomplete and sometimes inaccurate, which greatly limits the applicability of knowledge-based SDM methods. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for knowledge-based SDM, called PERIL, that learns from interaction experience to reason about contextual knowledge, as applied to urban driving scenarios. Experiments have been conducted using CARLA, a widely used autonomous driving simulator. Results demonstrate PERIL's superiority in comparison to existing knowledge-based SDM baselines.

  TL;DR:  We design and analyze best-arm identification algorithms for the setting where reward variances are not equal.   Abstract:   
 We study the problem of best-arm identification (BAI) in the fixed-budget setting with heterogeneous reward variances. We propose two variance-adaptive BAI algorithms for this setting: SHVar for known reward variances and SHAdaVar for unknown reward variances. Our algorithms rely on non-uniform budget allocations among the arms where the arms with higher reward variances are pulled more often than those with lower variances. The main algorithmic novelty is in the design of SHAdaVar, which allocates budget greedily based on overestimating the unknown reward variances. We bound probabilities of misidentifying the best arms in both SHVar and SHAdaVar. Our analyses rely on novel lower bounds on the number of pulls of an arm that do not require closed-form solutions to the budget allocation problem. Since one of our budget allocation problems is analogous to the optimal experiment design with unknown variances, we believe that our results are of a broad interest. Our experiments validate our theory, and show that SHVar and SHAdaVar outperform algorithms from prior works with analytical guarantees. 
 ID: 290 | Convergence Rates for Localized Actor-Critic in Networked Markov Potential Games   
  
 Zhaoyi Zhou, Zaiwei Chen, Yiheng Lin, Adam Wierman  

  TL;DR:  We design a localized actor-critic algorithm for networked Markov potential games with provable finite-time convergence guarantees.   Abstract:   
 We introduce a class of networked Markov potential games where agents are associated with nodes in a network, each agent has its own local potential function, and the rewards of each agent depend only on the states and actions of agents within a $\kappa$-hop neighborhood. In this context, we propose a localized actor-critic policy. The policy is scalable since each agent uses only local information and does not need access to the global state. Further, the policy avoids the curse of dimensionality through the use of function approximation. Our main results provide finite-sample guarantees. We prove an $\mathcal{O}(1/M^{1/4})$ rate of convergence of the averaged Nash regret up to a critic error and a localization error, where $M$ is the total iteration number. This is the first finite-sample bound for multi-agent competitive games that does not depend on the number of agents.

  TL;DR:  We propose a Nyström approximation of the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion for more than two components with theoretical guarantees.   Abstract:   
 Kernel techniques are among the most popular and powerful approaches of data science. Among the key features that make kernels ubiquitous are (i) the number of domains they have been designed for, (ii) the Hilbert structure of the function class associated to kernels facilitating their statistical analysis, and (iii) their ability to represent probability distributions without loss of information. These properties give rise to the immense success of Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) which is able to capture joint independence of random variables under mild conditions, and permits closed-form estimators with quadratic computational complexity (w.r.t.\ the sample size). In order to alleviate the quadratic computational bottleneck in large-scale applications, multiple HSIC approximations have been proposed, however these estimators are restricted to $M=2$ random variables, do not extend naturally to the $M\ge 2$ case, and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose an alternative Nyström-based HSIC estimator which handles the $M\ge 2$ case, prove its consistency, and demonstrate its applicability in multiple contexts, including synthetic examples, dependency testing of media annotations, and causal discovery.

  TL;DR:  By convex relaxations of distributional discrepancy optimizations, our method quantifies how close a chain of models approximates a real-world system.   Abstract:   
 Assessing the validity of a real-world system with respect to given quality criteria is a common yet costly task in industrial applications due to the vast number of required real-world tests. Validating such systems by means of simulation offers a promising and less expensive alternative, but requires an assessment of the simulation accuracy and therefore end-to-end measurements. Additionally, covariate shifts between simulations and actual usage can cause difficulties for estimating the reliability of such systems. In this work, we present a validation method that propagates bounds on distributional discrepancy measures through a composite system, thereby allowing us to derive an upper bound on the failure probability of the real system from potentially inaccurate simulations. Each propagation step entails an optimization problem, where -- for measures such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- we develop tight convex relaxations based on semidefinite programs. We demonstrate that our propagation method yields valid and useful bounds for composite systems exhibiting a variety of realistic effects. In particular, we show that the proposed method can successfully account for data shifts within the experimental design as well as model inaccuracies within the simulation.

  TL;DR:  We prove that previous attempts on designing group-equivariant ViT not effective in some cases, which is then addressed by a novel, effective equivariant positional encoding.   Abstract:   
 Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in computer vision. However, positional encoding in ViT makes it substantially difficult to realize the equivariance, compared to models based on convolutional operations which are translation-equivariant. Initial attempts have been made on designing equivariant ViT but proved not effective in some cases in this paper. To address this issue, we propose a Group Equivariant Vision Transformer (GE-ViT) via a novel, effective positional encoding operation. We prove that GE-ViT meets all the theoretical requirements of an equivariant neural network. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that GE-ViT has made significant improvement over non-equivariant self-attention networks. The code will be released publicly.

    Abstract:   
 Physically adversarial attacks can mislead detectors in the real world and have attracted increasing attention. However, most existing works directly manipulate the model‚Äôs final outputs as attack objects while ignoring the inherent characteristics of objects such as multi-scale features, which are easily trapped into model-specific local optimum and degrade the transferability. To address this issue, we propose the Multi-scale Feature-aware Attack (MFA) to generate adversarial camouflages with strong attacking ability and transferability by disrupting multi-scale object-aware critical features. Specifically, we adopt the location and category information of the detector outputs to assign attribution scores to different scale feature layers. Then, we weight each feature according to their attribution results and design a pixel-level loss function in the opposite optimized direction of object detection to generate adversarial camouflages. We conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and physical world on ten detection models (e.g., the up-to-date yolov7) and significantly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MFA.

    Abstract:   
 We study causal effect estimation from a mixture of observational and interventional data in a confounded linear regression model with multivariate treatments. We show that the statistical efficiency in terms of expected squared error can be improved by combining estimators arising from both the observational and interventional setting. To this end, we derive methods based on matrix weighted linear estimators and prove that our methods are asymptotically unbiased in the infinite sample limit. This is an important improvement compared to the pooled estimator using the union of interventional and observational data, for which the bias only vanishes if the ratio of observational to interventional data tends to zero. Studies on synthetic data confirm our theoretical findings. In settings where confounding is substantial and the ratio of observational to interventional data is large, our estimators outperform a Stein-type estimator and various other baselines. 
 ID: 307 | Diversity-enhanced Probabilistic Ensemble For Uncertainty Estimation   
  
 Hanjing Wang, Qiang Ji  

    Abstract:   
 Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models for prediction, which have demonstrated their effectiveness in accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) and strong robustness. Obtaining a diverse ensemble set of model parameters results in better Bayesian model averaging performance and better approximation of the true posterior distribution of model parameters. In this paper, we propose the diversity-enhanced probabilistic ensemble method with the adaptive uncertainty-guided ensemble learning strategy for better quantifying uncertainty and further improving the model robustness. Specifically, we construct the probabilistic ensemble model by building a Gaussian distribution of the model parameters for each ensemble component using Laplacian approximation in a post-processing manner. Then a mixture of Gaussian model is established with learnable and refinable parameters in an EM-like algorithm. During ensemble training, we leverage the uncertainty estimated from previous models as guidance when training the next one such that the new model will focus more on the less explored regions by previous models. Various experiments including out-of-distribution detection and image classification under distributional shifts have demonstrated better uncertainty estimation and improved model generalization ability for our proposed method.

  TL;DR:  We introduce a method for efficient online inference with advanced and computationally costly cognitive models, enabling use of modern machine learning pipelines also in the ubiquitous cases with humans in the loop.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic user modeling is essential for building collaborative AI systems within probabilistic frameworks. However, modern advanced user models, often designed as cognitive behavior simulators, are computationally prohibitive for interactive use in cooperative AI assistants. We address this problem by introducing widely-applicable differentiable surrogates for bypassing this computational bottleneck; the surrogates enable using modern behavioral models with online computational cost which is independent of their original computational cost. We show experimentally that modeling capabilities comparable to the only available solution, existing likelihood-free inference methods, are achievable with a computational cost suitable for online applications. Finally, we demonstrate how AI-assistants can now use cognitive models for online interaction in a menu-search task, which has so far required hours of computation during interaction. 
 ID: 310 | MMEL: A Joint Learning Framework for Multi-Mention Entity Linking   
  
 Chengmei YANG, Bowei He, Yimeng Wu, Chao Xing, Lianghua He, Chen Ma  

  TL;DR:  To tackle the multi-mention entity link problem, we propose a novel method, consisting of a context-entity joint feature extraction module, a multimodal learning framework, and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method with the pairwise training.   Abstract:   
 Entity linking, bridging mentions in the contexts with their corresponding entities in the knowledge bases, has attracted wide attention due to many potential applications. Previous methods mainly focus on the single-mention scenarios and neglect the scenarios where multiple mentions exist simultaneously in the same context, which limits their performance. In fact, such multi-mention scenarios are pretty common in public datasets and real-world applications. To solve this challenge, we first propose a joint feature extraction module to learn the representations of context and entity candidates, which can take the multimodal information into consideration. Then, we design a pairwise training scheme (for training) and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method (for testing) to model the potential connections between different mentions. We evaluate our method on a public dataset and a self-constructed dataset, NYTimes-MEL, under both the text-only and multimodal settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can largely outperform the state-of-the-art methods, especially in multi-mention scenarios. 
 ID: 320 | Layer-wise and Dimension-wise Locally Adaptive Federated Learning   
  
 Belhal Karimi, Xiaoyun Li, Ping Li  

    Abstract:   
 In the emerging paradigm of Federated Learning (FL), large amount of clients such as mobile devices are used to train possibly high-dimensional models on their respective data. Combing (\textit{dimension-wise}) adaptive gradient methods (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad) with FL has been an active direction, which is shown to outperform traditional SGD based FL in many cases. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training federated deep neural networks, and propose a novel FL framework which further introduces \emph{layer-wise} adaptivity to the local model updates to accelerate the convergence of adaptive FL methods. Our framework includes two variants based on two recent locally adaptive federated learning algorithms. Theoretically, we provide a convergence analysis of our layer-wise FL methods, coined Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB, which match the convergence rate of state-of-the-art results in adaptive FL and exhibits linear speedup in terms of the number of workers. Experimental results on various datasets and models, under both IID and non-IID local data settings, show that both Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB achieve faster convergence speed and better generalization performance, compared to various recent adaptive FL methods. 
 ID: 322 | Energy-based Predictive Representations for Partially Observed Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Tianjun Zhang, Tongzheng Ren, Chenjun Xiao, Wenli Xiao, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Dale Schuurmans, Bo Dai  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel predictive state representation with energy-based models, that shows superior performance on POMDPs.   Abstract:   
 In real world applications, it is usually necessary for a reinforcement learning algorithm to handle the partial observability beyond Markov decision processes (MDPs). Although the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) has been precisely motivated for this requirement, such a formulation raises significant computational and statistical hardness challenges in learning and planning. In this work, we introduce the Energy-based Predictive Representation (EPR), which leads to a unified framework for practical reinforcement learning algorithm design in both MDPs and POMDPs settings, to handle the learning, exploration, and planning in a coherent way. The proposed approach relies on the powerful neural energy-based model to extract sufficient representation, from which Q-functions can be efficiently approximated. With such a representation, we develop an efficient approach for computing confidence, which allows optimism/pessimism in the face of uncertainty to be efficiently implemented in planning, hence managing the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff. An experimental investigation shows that the proposed algorithm can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both MDP and POMDP settings in comparison to existing baselines. 
 ID: 325 | Incentivising Diffusion while Preserving Differential Privacy   
 [spotlight]  
 Fengjuan Jia, Mengxiao Zhang, Jiamou Liu, Bakh Khoussainov  

    Abstract:   
 Diffusion auction refers to an emerging paradigm of online marketplace where an auctioneer utilises a social network to attract potential buyers. Diffusion auction poses significant privacy risks. From the auction outcome, it is possible to infer hidden, and potentially sensitive, preferences of buyers. To mitigate such risks, we initiate the study of differential privacy (DP) in diffusion auction mechanisms. DP is a well-established notion of privacy that protects a system against inference attacks. Achieving DP in diffusion auctions is non-trivial as the well-designed auction rules are required to incentivise the buyers to truthfully report their neighbourhood. We study the single-unit case and design two differentially private diffusion mechanisms (DPDMs): recursive DPDM and layered DPDM. We prove that these mechanisms guarantee differential privacy, incentive compatibility and individual rationality for both valuations and neighbourhood. We then empirically compare their performance on real and synthetic datasets. 
 ID: 328 | Learning To Invert: Simple Adaptive Attacks for Gradient Inversion in Federated Learning   
  
 Ruihan Wu, Xiangyu Chen, Chuan Guo, Kilian Q Weinberger  

    Abstract:   
 Gradient inversion attack enables recovery of training samples from model gradients in federated learning (FL), and constitutes a serious threat to data privacy. To mitigate this vulnerability, prior work proposed both principled defenses based on differential privacy, as well as heuristic defenses based on gradient compression as countermeasures. These defenses have so far been very effective, in particular those based on gradient compression that allow the model to maintain high accuracy while greatly reducing the effectiveness of attacks. In this work, we argue that such findings underestimate the privacy risk in FL. As a counterexample, we show that existing defenses can be broken by a simple adaptive attack, where a model trained on auxiliary data is able to invert gradients on both vision and language tasks. 
 ID: 332 | Approximating Probabilistic Explanations via Supermodular Minimization   
  
 Louenas Bounia, Frederic M Koriche  

  TL;DR:  In the setting of probabilistic explanations, we propose two greedy approximation algorithms for minimizing explanation errors subject to a cardinality constraint.   Abstract:   
 Explaining in accurate and intelligible terms the predictions made by classifiers is a key challenge of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). To this end, an abductive explanation for the output $h(x)$ of some data instance $x$, given a classifier $h$, is a subset-minimal collection of features $I$ such that the restriction of $x$ to $I$ is sufficient to determine $h(x)$. Yet, due to cognitive limitations, abductive explanations are often too large to be interpretable, and in those cases, we need to identify a subset $S$ of $I$ of size at most $k$ that determines $h(x)$ with high probability. In this paper, we show that finding such probabilistic explanations is NP-hard, even for decision trees. In order to circumvent this issue, we investigate the approximability of probabilistic explanations through the lens of supermodularity. We examine both greedy descent and greedy ascent methods for supermodular minimization, whose approximation guarantees depend on the curvature of the ``unnormalized'' error function that evaluates the precision of $S$. Based on various experiments for explaining decision tree predictions, we show that our greedy algorithms provide an efficient alternative to the state-of-the-art constraint optimization method. 
 ID: 341 | Stochastic Graphical Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards   
  
 Yutian Gou, Jinfeng Yi, Lijun Zhang  

    Abstract:   
 We consider stochastic graphical bandits, where after pulling an arm, the decision maker observes rewards of not only the chosen arm but also its neighbors in a feedback graph. Most of existing work assumes that the rewards are drawn from bounded or at least sub-Gaussian distributions, which however may be violated in many practical scenarios such as social advertising and financial markets. To settle this issue, we investigate stochastic graphical bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the distributions have finite moments of order $1+\epsilon$, for some $\epsilon\in(0, 1]$. Firstly, we develop one UCB-type algorithm, whose expected regret is upper bounded by a sum of gap-based quantities over the \textit{clique covering} of the feedback graph. The key idea is to estimate the reward means of the selected arm's neighbors by more refined robust estimators, and to construct a graph-based upper confidence bound for selecting candidates. Secondly, we design another elimination-based strategy and improve the regret bound to a gap-based sum with size controlled by the \textit{independence number} of the feedback graph. For benign graphs, the \textit{independence number} could be smaller than the size of the \textit{clique covering}, resulting in tighter regret bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

    [slides]   
   
  TL;DR:  We present new algorithms for learning, sampling and counting Bayesian networks parameterized by the vertex cover number.   Abstract:   
 The problem of structure learning in Bayesian networks asks for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that maximizes a given scoring function. Since the problem is NP-hard, research effort has been put into discovering restricted classes of DAGs for which the search problem can be solved in polynomial time. Here, we initiate investigation of questions that have received less attention thus far: Are the known polynomial algorithms close to the best possible, or is there room for significant improvements? If the interest is in Bayesian learning, that is, in sampling or weighted counting of DAGs, can we obtain similar complexity results? Focusing on DAGs with bounded vertex cover number‚Äìa class studied in Korhonen and Parviainen's seminal work (NIPS 2015)‚Äìwe answer the questions in the affirmative. We also give, apparently the first, proof that the counting problem is #P-hard in general. In addition, we show that under the vertex-cover constraint counting is #W[1]-hard. 
 ID: 351 | Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Shared and Individual Sources   
  
 Teodora Pandeva, Patrick Forré  

    Abstract:   
 Independent component analysis (ICA) is a blind source separation method for linear disentanglement of independent latent sources from observed data. We investigate the special setting of noisy linear ICA where the observations are split among different views, each receiving a mixture of shared and individual sources. We prove that the corresponding linear structure is identifiable, and the sources distribution can be recovered. To computationally estimate the sources, we optimize a constrained form of the joint log-likelihood of the observed data among all views. We show empirically that our objective recovers the sources also in the case when the measurements are corrupted by noise. Furthermore, we propose a model selection procedure for recovering the number of shared sources which we verify empirically. Finally, we apply the proposed model in a challenging real-life application, where the estimated shared sources from two large transcriptome datasets (observed data) provided by two different labs (two different views) lead to recovering biologically meaningful (shared) sources utilized for finding a plausible representation of the underlying graph structure.

  TL;DR:  We present faster inference algorithms for probabilistic generating circuits and study the hardness of parameter learning.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic generating circuits (PGCs) are economical representations of multivariate probability generating polynomials (PGPs). They unify and extend decomposable probabilistic circuits and determinantal point processes, admitting tractable computation of marginal probabilities. However, the need for addition and multiplication of high-degree polynomials incurs a significant additional factor in the complexity of inference. Here, we give a new inference algorithm that eliminates this extra factor. Specifically, we show that it suffices to keep track of the highest degree coefficients of the computed polynomials, rendering the algorithm linear in the circuit size. In addition, we show that determinant-based circuits need not be expanded to division-free circuits, but can be handled by division-based fast algorithms. While these advances enhance the appeal of PGCs, we also discover an obstacle to learning them from data: it is NP-hard to recognize whether a given PGC encodes a PGP. We discuss the implications of our ambivalent findings and sketch a method, in which learning is restricted to PGCs that are composed of moderate-size subcircuits. 
 ID: 354 | JANA: Jointly Amortized Neural Approximation of Complex Bayesian Models   
 [spotlight]  
 Stefan T. Radev, Marvin Schmitt, Valentin Pratz, Umberto Picchini, Ullrich Koethe, Paul Buerkner  

  TL;DR:  This work proposes a deep learning method for simulatenously approximating intractable likelihood functions and posterior densities arising in surrogate modeling and simulation-based inference.   Abstract:   
 This work proposes "jointly amortized neural approximation" (JANA) of intractable likelihood functions and posterior densities arising in Bayesian surrogate modeling and simulation-based inference. We train three complementary networks in an end-to-end fashion: 1) a summary network to compress individual data points, sets, or time series into informative embedding vectors; 2) a posterior network to learn an amortized approximate posterior; and 3) a likelihood network to learn an amortized approximate likelihood. Their interaction opens a new route to amortized marginal likelihood and posterior predictive estimation - two important ingredients of Bayesian workflows that are often too expensive for standard methods. We benchmark the fidelity of JANA on a variety of simulation models against state-of-the-art Bayesian methods and propose a powerful and interpretable diagnostic for joint calibration. In addition, we investigate the ability of recurrent likelihood networks to emulate complex time series models without resorting to hand-crafted summary statistics.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We propose approximate Bayes optimal selection of pseudo-samples in self-training to address the confirmation bias.   Abstract:   
 Semi-supervised learning by self-training heavily relies on pseudo-label selection (PLS). The selection often depends on the initial model fit on labeled data. Early overfitting might thus be propagated to the final model by selecting instances with overconfident but erroneous predictions, often referred to as confirmation bias. This paper introduces BPLS, a Bayesian framework for PLS that aims to mitigate this issue. At its core lies a criterion for selecting instances to label: an analytical approximation of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We derive this selection criterion by proving Bayes optimality of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We further overcome computational hurdles by approximating the criterion analytically. Its relation to the marginal likelihood allows us to come up with an approximation based on Laplace's method and the Gaussian integral. We empirically assess BPLS for parametric generalized linear and non-parametric generalized additive models on simulated and real-world data. When faced with high-dimensional data prone to overfitting, BPLS outperforms traditional PLS methods. 
 ID: 358 | Probabilistic Multi-Dimensional Classification   
  
 Vu-Linh Nguyen, Yang Yang, Cassio de Campos  

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we present a first attempt to learn probabilistic multi-dimensional classifiers which are interpretable, accurate, scalable and capable of handling mixed data.   Abstract:   
 Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) can be employed in a range of applications where one needs to predict multiple class variables for each given instance. Arguably, probabilistic MDC has been studied seldom when compared to its single class variable counterpart. Existing MDC methods often suffer from at least one of inaccuracy, scalability, limited use to certain types of data, hardness of interpretation or lack of probabilistic (uncertainty) estimations. To our best knowledge, this paper is a first attempt to address all these disadvantages simultaneously. We propose a formal framework for probabilistic MDC in which learning an optimal multi-dimensional classifier can be decomposed, without loss of generality, into learning a set of (smaller) single-variable multi-class probabilistic classifiers and a directed acyclic graph. Current and future developments of both probabilistic classification and graphical model learning can directly enhance our framework, which is flexible and provably optimal. A collection of experiments is conducted to highlight the usefulness of this MDC framework. 
 ID: 368 | A scalable Walsh-Hadamard regularizer to overcome the low-degree spectral bias of neural networks   
  
 Ali Gorji, Andisheh Amrollahi, Andreas Krause  

  TL;DR:  We empirically investigate the spectral bias of neural networks in learning only low-degree interactions and introduce a regularizer to remedy this.   Abstract:   
 Despite the capacity of neural nets to learn arbitrary functions, models trained through gradient descent often exhibit a bias towards "simpler" functions. Various notions of simplicity have been introduced to characterize this behavior. Here, we focus on the case of neural networks with discrete (zero-one) inputs through the lens of their Fourier (Walsh-Hadamard) transforms, where the notion of simplicity can be captured through the degree of the Fourier coefficients. We empirically show that neural networks have a tendency to learn lower-degree frequencies. We show how this spectral bias towards simpler features can in fact hurt the neural network's generalization on real-world datasets. To remedy this we propose a new and scalable functional regularization scheme that aids the neural network to learn higher degree frequencies. Our regularizer also helps avoid erroneous identification of low-degree frequencies, which further improves generalization. We extensively evaluate our regularizer on synthetic datasets to gain insights into its behavior. Finally, we show significantly improved generalization on four different datasets compared to standard neural networks and other relevant baselines. 
 ID: 370 | On the Role of Model Uncertainties in Bayesian Optimisation   
  
 Jonathan Foldager, Mikkel Jordahn, Lars Kai Hansen, Michael Riis Andersen  

    Abstract:   
 Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a popular method for black-box optimization, which relies on uncertainty as part of its decision-making process when deciding which experiment to perform next. However, not much work has addressed the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the BO algorithm and to what extent calibrated uncertainties improve the ability to find the global optimum. In this work, we provide an extensive study of the relationship between the BO performance (regret) and uncertainty calibration for popular surrogate models and acquisition functions, and compare them across both synthetic and real-world experiments. Our results show that Gaussian Processes, and more surprisingly, Deep Ensembles are strong surrogate models. Our results further show a positive association between calibration error and regret, but interestingly, this association disappears when we control for the type of surrogate model in the analysis. We also study the effect of recalibration and demonstrate that it generally does not lead to improved regret. Finally, we provide theoretical justification for why uncertainty calibration might be difficult to combine with BO due to the small sample sizes commonly used.

    Abstract:   
 The quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in terms of conditional entropy and mutual information, respectively, has recently become quite common in machine learning. While the properties of these measures, which are rooted in information theory, seem appealing at first glance, we identify various incoherencies that call their appropriateness into question. In addition to the measures themselves, we critically discuss the idea of an additive decomposition of total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic constituents. Experiments across different computer vision tasks support our theoretical findings and raise concerns about current practice in uncertainty quantification.

 Bo Chen, Calvin Hawkins, Mustafa O. Karabag, Cyrus Neary, Matthew Hale, ufuk topcu  

  TL;DR:  We develop a framework to provide inter-agent privacy in multiagent systems and to synthesize policies that remain performant under private communications.   Abstract:   
 Privacy-aware multiagent systems must protect agents' sensitive data while simultaneously ensuring that agents accomplish their shared objectives. Towards this goal, we propose a framework to privatize inter-agent communications in cooperative multiagent decision-making problems. We study sequential decision-making problems formulated as cooperative Markov games with reach-avoid objectives. We apply a differential privacy mechanism to privatize agents' communicated symbolic state trajectories, and analyze tradeoffs between the strength of privacy and the team's performance. For a given level of privacy, this tradeoff is shown to depend critically upon the total correlation among agents' state-action processes. We synthesize policies that are robust to privacy by reducing the value of the total correlation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the team's performance under these policies decreases by only 6 percent when comparing private versus non-private implementations of communication. By contrast, the team's performance decreases by 88 percent when using baseline policies that ignore total correlation and only optimize team performance.

  TL;DR:  We theoretically explore adversarial imitation learning with unknown transitions.   Abstract:   
 The process of learning good policies from expert demonstrations, known as imitation learning (IL), has been proven effective in many applications. Adversarial imitation learning (AIL), a subset of IL methods, is particularly promising, but its theoretical foundation in the presence of unknown transitions has yet to be fully developed. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of AIL in this context, where the primary challenge is the stochastic and uncertain nature of environment transitions. We examine the expert sample complexity and interaction complexity required to recover good policies, which are of great practical interest. To this end, we establish a framework connecting reward-free exploration and AIL, and propose an algorithm, MB-TAIL, that achieves the minimax optimal expert sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (H^{3/2} |\mathcal{S}|/\varepsilon)$ and interaction complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (H^{3} |\mathcal{S}|^2 |\mathcal{A}|/\varepsilon^2)$. Here, $H$ represents the planning horizon, $|\mathcal{S}|$ is the state space size, $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the action space size, and $\varepsilon$ is the desired imitation gap. MB-TAIL is the first algorithm to achieve this level of expert sample complexity in the unknown transition setting and improves upon the interaction complexity of the best-known algorithm, OAL, by $\mathcal{O} (H)$. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of MB-TAIL by extending it to the function approximation setting and proving that it can achieve expert sample and interaction complexity independent of $|\mathcal{S}|$. 
 ID: 387 | Combinatorial Categorized Bandits with Expert Rankings   
  
 Sayak Ray Chowdhury, Gaurav Sinha, Nagarajan Natarajan, Amit Sharma  

    Abstract:   
 Many real-world systems such as e-commerce websites and content-serving platforms employ two-stage recommendation --- in the first stage, multiple nominators (experts) provide ranked lists of items (one nominator per category, e.g., sports and political news articles), and in the second stage, an aggregator filters across the lists and outputs a single (short) list of $K$ items to the users. The aggregation stage can be posed as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, with the additional structure that the arms are grouped into categories (disjoint sets of items) and the ranking of arms within each category is known. We propose algorithms for selecting top $K$ items in this setting under two learning objectives, namely minimizing regret over rounds and identifying the top $K$ items within a fixed number of rounds. For each of the objectives, we provide sharp regret/error analysis using carefully defined notion of ``gap'' that exploits our problem structure. The resulting regret/error bounds strictly improve over prior work in combinatorial bandits literature. We also provide supporting evidence from simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic problems. 
 ID: 390 | Causal Discovery for time series from multiple datasets with latent contexts   
  
 Wiebke Günther, Urmi Ninad, Jakob Runge  

    Abstract:   
 Causal discovery from time series data is a typical problem setting across the sciences. Often, multiple datasets of the same system variables are available, for instance, time series of river runoff from different catchments. The local catchment systems then share certain causal drivers, such as time-dependent large-scale weather over all catchments, but differ in other catchment-specific drivers, such as the altitude of the catchment. These drivers can be called temporal and spatial contexts, respectively, and are often partially unobserved. Pooling the datasets and considering the joint causal graph among system, context, and certain auxiliary variables enables us to overcome such latent confounding of system variables. In this work, we present a non-parametric time series causal discovery method, J(oint)-PCMCI+, that efficiently learns such joint causal time series graphs when both observed and latent contexts are present, including time lags. We present asymptotic consistency results and numerical experiments demonstrating the utility and limitations of the method. 
 ID: 392 | Increasing Effect Sizes of Pairwise Conditional Independence Tests between Random Vectors   
  
 Tom Hochsprung, Jonas Wahl, Andreas Gerhardus, Urmi Ninad, Jakob Runge  

  TL;DR:  Our paper introduces a new pairwise conditional independence testing algorithm.   Abstract:   
 A simple approach to test for conditional independence of two random vectors given a third random vector is to simultaneously test for conditional independence of every pair of components of the two random vectors given the third random vector. In this work, we show that conditioning on additional components of the two random vectors that are independent given the third one increases the tests' effect sizes while leaving the validity of the overall approach unchanged. Up to the effective reduction of the sample size due to enlarging the conditioning sets, these larger effect sizes lead to higher statistical power. We leverage this result to derive a practical pairwise testing algorithm that first chooses tests with a relatively large effect size and then does the actual testing. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms standard pairwise independence testing and other existing methods if the dependence within the two random vectors is sufficiently high. 
 ID: 394 | Causal Discovery with Hidden Confounders   
  
 David Kaltenpoth, Jilles Vreeken  

  TL;DR:  We propose a general framework for discovering latent confounders from purely observational data. We show that in the sparse linear Gaussian case, our proposed model is identifiable and permits a consistent algorithm.   Abstract:   
 Causal sufficiency is a cornerstone assumption in causal discovery. It is, however, both unlikely to hold in practice as well as unverifiable. When it does not hold, existing methods struggle to return meaningful results. In this paper, we show how to discover the causal network over both observed and unobserved variables. Moreover, we show that the causal model is identifiable in the sparse linear Gaussian case. More generally, we extend the algorithmic Markov condition to include latent confounders. We propose a consistent score based on the Minimum Description Length principle to discover the full causal network, including latent confounders. Based on this score, we develop an effective algorithm that finds those sets of nodes for which the addition of a confounding factor $Z$ is most beneficial, then fits a new causal network over both observed as well as inferred latent variables. 
 ID: 396 | When are Post-Hoc Conceptual Explanations Identifiable?   
  
 Tobias Leemann, Michael Kirchhof, Yao Rong, Enkelejda Kasneci, Gjergji Kasneci  

  TL;DR:  We derive conditions under which conceptual explanation methods recover the ground truth concepts and additionally propose two new methods for the case of dependent concept distributions.   Abstract:   
 Interest in understanding and factorizing learned embedding spaces through conceptual explanations is steadily growing. When no human concept labels are available, concept discovery methods search trained embedding spaces for interpretable concepts like object shape or color that can be used to provide post-hoc explanations for decisions. Unlike previous work, we argue that concept discovery should be identifiable, meaning that a number of known concepts can be provably recovered to guarantee reliability of the explanations. As a starting point, we explicitly make the connection between concept discovery and classical methods like Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis by showing that they can recover independent concepts with non-Gaussian distributions. For dependent concepts, we propose two novel approaches that exploit functional compositionality properties of image-generating processes. Our provably identifiable concept discovery methods substantially outperform competitors on a battery of experiments including hundreds of trained models and dependent concepts, where they exhibit up to 29 % better alignment with the ground truth. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for reliable concept discovery without human labels.

  TL;DR:  We propose data independent and data dependent algorithms for differentially private synthetic data generation whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset.   Abstract:   
 We propose both data independent and data dependent algorithms for $\epsilon$-differentially private synthetic data generation whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset. Creation of a synthetic dataset that faithfully represents the data distribution and simultaneously preserves privacy is a major research challenge. Many space partitioning based approaches have emerged in recent years for answering statistical queries in a differentially private manner. However, for synthetic data generation problem, recent research has been mainly focused on deep generative models. In contrast, we exploit space partitioning techniques together with noise perturbation and thus achieve intuitive and transparent algorithms. We provide theoretical results on the utility-privacy trade-offs and show how our data dependent approach overcomes the curse of dimensionality and leads to a scalable algorithm. We show empirical utility improvements over the prior work, and discuss performance of our algorithm on a downstream classification task on a real dataset.

    Abstract:   
 Deep kernel processes are a recently introduced class of deep Bayesian models that have the flexibility of neural networks, but work entirely with Gram matrices. They operate by alternately sampling a Gram matrix from a distribution over positive semi-definite matrices, and applying a deterministic transformation. When the distribution is chosen to be Wishart, the model is called a deep Wishart process (DWP). This particular model is of interest because its prior is equivalent to a deep Gaussian process (DGP) prior, but at the same time it is invariant to rotational symmetries, leading to a simpler posterior distribution. Practical inference in the DWP was made possible in recent work ("A variational approximate posterior for the deep Wishart process" Ober and Aitchison, 2021a) where the authors used a generalisation of the Bartlett decomposition of the Wishart distribution as the variational approximate posterior. However, predictive performance in that paper was less impressive than one might expect, with the DWP only beating a DGP on a few of the UCI datasets used for comparison. In this paper, we show that further generalising their distribution to allow linear combinations of rows and columns in the Bartlett decomposition results in better predictive performance, while incurring negligible additional computation cost. 
 ID: 406 | Learning Good Interventions in Causal Graphs via Covering   
  
 Ayush Sawarni, Rahul Madhavan, Gaurav Sinha, Siddharth Barman  

  TL;DR:  State-of-the-art guarantees for the causal bandit problem   Abstract:   
 We study the causal bandit problem that entails identifying a near-optimal intervention from a specified set $\cal{A}$ of (possibly non-atomic) interventions over a given causal graph. Here, an optimal intervention in $\cal{A}$ is one that maximizes the expected value for a designated reward variable in the graph, and we use the standard notion of simple regret to quantify near optimality. Considering Bernoulli random variables and for causal graphs on $N$ vertices with constant in-degree, prior work has achieved a worst case guarantee of $\widetilde{O} (N/\sqrt{T})$ for simple regret. The current work utilizes the idea of covering interventions (which are not necessarily contained within $\cal{A}$) and establishes a simple regret guarantee of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N/T})$. Notably, and in contrast to prior work, our simple regret bound depends only on explicit parameters of the problem instance. We also go beyond prior work and achieve a simple regret guarantee for causal graphs with unobserved variables. Further, we perform experiments to show improvements over baselines in this setting.

  TL;DR:  Variable importance can be used as a distance metric for almost exact matching.   Abstract:   
 Our goal is to produce methods for observational causal inference that are auditable, easy to troubleshoot, yield accurate treatment effect estimates, and scalable to high-dimensional data. We describe a general framework called Model-to-Match that achieves these goals by (i) learning a distance metric via outcome modeling, (ii) creating matched groups using the distance metric, and (iii) using the matched groups to estimate treatment effects. Model-to-Match uses variable importance measurements to construct a distance metric, making it a flexible framework that can be adapted to various applications. Concentrating on the scalability of the problem in the number of potential confounders, we operationalize the Model-to-Match framework with LASSO. We derive performance guarantees for settings where LASSO outcome modeling consistently identifies all confounders (importantly without requiring the linear model to be correctly specified). We also provide experimental results demonstrating the auditability of matches, as well as extensions to more general nonparametric outcome modeling.

  TL;DR:  A formal analysis of algorithms that would lead to safe shutdown behaviour   Abstract:   
 How can humans stay in control of advanced artificial intelligence systems? One proposal is corrigibility, which requires the agent to follow the instructions of a human overseer, without inappropriately influencing them. In this paper, we provide the first formal definition of corrigibility, and show that it implies appropriate shutdown behavior, retention of human autonomy, and safety in low-stakes settings. We also analyse the related concepts of non-obstruction and counterfactual obedience, as well as three previously proposed corrigibility algorithms, and one new algorithm. 
 ID: 421 | Benefits of Monotonicity in Safe Exploration with Gaussian Processes   
  
 Arpan Losalka, Jonathan Scarlett  

    Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of sequentially maximising an unknown function over a set of actions while ensuring that every sampled point has a function value below a given safety threshold. We model the function using kernel-based and Gaussian process methods, while differing from previous works in our assumption that the function is monotonically increasing with respect to a safety variable. This assumption is motivated by various practical applications such as adaptive clinical trial design and robotics. Taking inspiration from the GP-UCB and SAFEOPT algorithms, we propose an algorithm, monotone safe UCB (M-SafeUCB) for this task. We show that M-SafeUCB enjoys theoretical guarantees in terms of safety, a suitably-defined regret notion, and approximately finding the entire safe boundary. In addition, we illustrate that the monotonicity assumption yields significant benefits in terms of the guarantees obtained, as well as algorithmic simplicity and efficiency. We support our theoretical findings by performing empirical evaluations on a variety of functions, including a simulated clinical trial experiment.

  TL;DR:  This work proposes a novel method to derive efficient message passing algorithms for approximate inference on graphs with many cycles.   Abstract:   
 Message passing on factor graphs is a powerful framework for probabilistic inference, which finds important applications in various scientific domains. The most wide-spread message passing scheme is the sum-product algorithm (SPA) which gives exact results on trees but often fails on graphs with many small cycles. We search for an alternative message passing algorithm which works particularly well on such cyclic graphs. Therefore, we challenge the extrinsic principle of the SPA, which loses its purpose on graphs with cycles. We further replace the local SPA message update rule at the factor nodes of the underlying graph with a generic mapping, which is optimized in a data-driven fashion. These modifications lead to a considerable improvement of the performance, while preserving the simplicity of the SPA. We evaluate our method for two classes of cyclic graphs: the 2x2 fully connected Ising grid and factor graphs for symbol detection on linear communication channels with inter-symbol interference. To enable the method for large graphs as they occur in practical applications, we develop a novel loss function which is inspired by the Bethe approximation from statistical physics and allows for training in an unsupervised fashion.

    Abstract:   
 Under a simplified data model, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of learning from data that have an underlying low-rank tensor structure in both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the supervised setting, we provide an analysis of a Ridge classifier (with high regularization parameter) with and without knowledge of the low-rank structure of the data. Our results quantify analytically the gain in misclassification errors achieved by exploiting the low-rank structure for denoising purposes, as opposed to treating data as mere vectors. We further provide a similar analysis in the context of clustering, thereby quantifying the exact performance gap between tensor methods and standard approaches which treat data as simple vectors. 
 ID: 433 | Concurrent Misclassification and Out-of-Distribution Detection for Semantic Segmentation via Energy-Based Normalizing Flow   
  
 Denis A Gudovskiy, Tomoyuki Okuno, Yohei Nakata  

  TL;DR:  A normalizing flow model with the energy-based inputs to detect in-distribution misclassifications and out-of-distribution examples for semantic segmentation application   Abstract:   
 Recent semantic segmentation models accurately classify test-time examples that are similar to a training dataset distribution. However, their discriminative closed-set approach is not robust in practical data setups with distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. As a result, the predicted probabilities can be very imprecise when used as confidence scores at test time. To address this, we propose a generative model for concurrent in-distribution misclassification (IDM) and OOD detection that relies on a normalizing flow framework. The proposed flow-based detector with an energy-based inputs (FlowEneDet) can extend previously deployed segmentation models without their time-consuming retraining. Our FlowEneDet results in a low-complexity architecture with marginal increase in the memory footprint. FlowEneDet achieves promising results on Cityscapes, Cityscapes-C, FishyScapes and SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmarks in IDM/OOD detection when applied to pretrained DeepLabV3+ and SegFormer semantic segmentation models. 
 ID: 434 | Scalable and Robust Tensor Ring Decomposition for Large-scale Data   
  
 Yicong He, George K. Atia  

    Abstract:   
 Tensor ring (TR) decomposition has recently received increased attention due to its superior expressive performance for high-order tensors. However, the applicability of traditional TR decomposition algorithms to real-world applications is hindered by prevalent large data sizes, missing entries, and corruption with outliers. In this work, we propose a scalable and robust TR decomposition algorithm capable of handling large-scale tensor data with missing entries and gross corruptions. We first develop a novel auto-weighted steepest descent method that can adaptively fill the missing entries and identify the outliers during the decomposition process. Further, taking advantage of the tensor ring model, we develop a novel fast Gram matrix computation (FGMC) approach and a randomized subtensor sketching (RStS) strategy which yield significant reduction in storage and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing TR decomposition methods in the presence of outliers, and runs significantly faster than existing robust tensor completion algorithms. 
 ID: 437 | Quantifying lottery tickets under label noise: accuracy, calibration, and complexity   
  
 Viplove Arora, Daniele Irto, Sebastian Goldt, Guido Sanguinetti  

  TL;DR:  Pruning networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude can be pruned to obtain small networks of comparable sizes that have low test error and good calibration.   Abstract:   
 Pruning deep neural networks is a widely used strategy to alleviate the computational burden in machine learning. Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that pruned models retain very high accuracy even with a tiny fraction of parameters. However, relatively little work has gone into characterising the small pruned networks obtained, beyond a measure of their accuracy. In this paper, we study small networks obtained via the iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) procedure on data with label noise. We observe empirically that, for a given task, IMP tends to converge to networks of comparable sizes even when starting from full networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude. We analyse the best pruned models in a controlled experimental setup and show that their number of parameters reflects task difficulty and that they are much better than full networks at capturing the true conditional probability distribution of the labels. On real data, we similarly observe that pruned models are less prone to overconfident predictions. Our results suggest that pruned models obtained via IMP not only have advantageous computational properties but also provide a better representation of uncertainty in learning. 
 ID: 442 | Vacant Holes for Unsupervised Detection of the Outliers in Compact Latent Representation   
  
 Misha Glazunov, Apostolis Zarras  

  TL;DR:  A method for unsupervised outlier detection utilizing holes based on the compact latent space with constrained factors of variation   Abstract:   
 Detection of the outliers is pivotal for any machine learning model deployed and operated in real-world. It is essential for the Deep Neural Networks that were shown to be overconfident with such inputs. Moreover, even deep generative models that allow estimation of the probability density of the input fail in achieving this task. In this work, we concentrate on the specific type of these models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). First, we unveil a significant theoretical flaw in the assumption of the classical VAE model. Second, we enforce an accommodating topological property to the image of the deep neural mapping to the latent space: compactness to alleviate the flaw and obtain the means to provably bound it within the determined limits by squeezing both inliers and outliers together. We enforce compactness using two approaches: Alexandroff extension and fixed Lipschitz continuity constant on the mapping of the encoder of the VAEs. Finally and most importantly, we discover that the anomalous inputs predominantly tend to land on the vacant latent holes within the compact space, enabling their successful identification. For that reason, we introduce a specifically devised score for hole detection and evaluate the solution against several baseline benchmarks achieving promising results.

  TL;DR:  We develop subgraph sampling procedure that is end-to-end trainable, that we train jointly with graph neural networks.   Abstract:   
 Sampling subgraphs for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is receiving much attention from the GNN community. While a variety of methods have been proposed, each method samples the graph according to its own heuristic. However, there has been little work in mixing these heuristics in an end-to-end trainable manner. In this work, we design a generative framework for graph sampling. Our method, SubMix, parameterizes graph sampling as a convex combination of heuristics. We show that a continuous relaxation of the discrete sampling process allows us to efficiently obtain analytical gradients for training the sampling parameters. Our experimental results illustrate the usefulness of learning graph sampling in three scenarios: (1) robust training of GNNs by automatically learning to discard noisy edge sources; (2) improving model performance by trainable and online edge subset selection; and (3) by integrating our framework into state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoupled GNN models, for homogeneous OGBN datasets. Our method raises the SOTA on challenging ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-products, respectively, by over 4 and 0.5 percentage points.

  TL;DR:  We show how pre-training GPT models can be accelerated by using unstructured weight sparsity to reduce the training FLOPs by up to 2.5x, while retaining the benefits of pre-trained textual representations in large language models.   Abstract:   
 The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has contributed to a number of breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Instead of directly training on a downstream task, language models are first pre-trained on large datasets with cross-domain knowledge (e.g., Pile, MassiveText, etc.) and then fine-tuned on task-specific data (e.g., natural language generation, text summarization, etc.). Scaling the model and dataset size has helped improve the performance of LLMs, but unfortunately, this also lead to highly prohibitive computational costs. Pre-training LLMs often require orders of magnitude more FLOPs than fine-tuning and the model capacity often remains the same between the two phases. To achieve training efficiency~w.r.t training FLOPs, we propose to decouple the model capacity between the two phases and introduce Sparse Pre-training and Dense Fine-tuning (SPDF). In this work, we show the benefits of using unstructured weight sparsity to train only a subset of weights during pre-training (Sparse Pre-training) and then recover the representational capacity by allowing the zeroed weights to learn (Dense Fine-tuning). We demonstrate that we can induce up to 75\% sparsity into a 1.3B parameter GPT-3 XL model resulting in a 2.5x reduction in pre-training FLOPs, without a significant loss in accuracy on the downstream tasks relative to the dense baseline. By rigorously evaluating multiple downstream tasks, we also establish a relationship between sparsity, task complexity and dataset size. Our work presents a promising direction to train large GPT models at a fraction of the training FLOPs using weight sparsity, while retaining the benefits of pre-trained textual representations for downstream tasks.

    Abstract:   
 Control variates can be a powerful tool to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators, but constructing effective control variates can be challenging when the number of samples is small. In this paper, we show that when a large number of related integrals need to be computed, it is possible to leverage the similarity between these integration tasks to improve performance even when the number of samples per task is very small. Our approach, called meta learning CVs (Meta-CVs), can be used for up to hundreds or thousands of tasks. Our empirical assessment indicates that Meta-CVs can lead to significant variance reduction in such settings, and our theoretical analysis establishes general conditions under which Meta-CVs can be successfully trained.

 Lucas Clarté, Bruno Loureiro, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborova  

  TL;DR:  We describe a new method to calibrate the prediction of neural networks, similar to temperature scaling   Abstract:   
 Despite their incredible performance, it is well reported that deep neural networks tend to be overoptimistic about their prediction confidence. Finding effective and efficient calibration methods for neural networks is therefore an important endeavour towards better uncertainty quantification in deep learning. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel calibration technique named expectation consistency (EC), consisting of a post-training rescaling of the last layer weights by enforcing that the average validation confidence coincides with the average proportion of correct labels. First, we show that the EC method achieves similar calibration performance to temperature scaling (TS) across different neural network architectures and data sets, all while requiring similar validation samples and computational resources. However, we argue that EC provides a principled method grounded on a Bayesian optimality principle known as the Nishimori identity. Next, we provide an asymptotic characterization of both TS and EC in a synthetic setting and show that their performance crucially depends on the target function. In particular, we discuss examples where EC significantly outperforms TS. 
 ID: 457 | Correcting for Nonignorable Selection Bias and Missing Response in Regression using Privileged Information   
  
 Philip Boeken, Arnoud De Kroon, Mathijs de Jong, Joris Mooij, Onno Zoeter  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel imputation based method that uses privileged information for correcting for selection bias or missing response. The method appropriately corrects for bias, and extrapolates better than importance weighted regression.   Abstract:   
 When estimating a regression model, we might have data where some labels are missing, or our data might be biased by a selection mechanism. When the response or selection mechanism is ignorable (i.e., independent of the response variable given the features) one can use off-the-shelf regression methods; in the nonignorable case one typically has to adjust for bias. We observe that privileged data (i.e. data that is only available during training) might render a nonignorable selection mechanism ignorable. We refer to this scenario as Privilegedly Missing at Random (PMAR). We propose a novel imputation-based regression method, named repeated regression, that is suitable for PMAR. We also consider an importance weighted regression method, and a doubly robust combination of the two. The proposed methods are easy to implement with most popular out-of-the-box regression algorithms. We empirically assess the performance of the proposed methods with extensive simulated experiments and on a synthetically augmented real-world dataset. We conclude that repeated regression can appropriately correct for bias, and can have considerable advantage over weighted regression, especially when extrapolating to regions of the feature space where response is never observed. 
 ID: 458 | Mnemonist: Locating Model Parameters that Memorize Training Examples   
  
 Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Jamie Hayes, Borja Balle, Adrian Weller  

    Abstract:   
 Recent work has shown that an adversary can reconstruct training examples given access to the parameters of a deep learning image classification model. We show that the quality of reconstruction depends heavily on the type of activation functions used. In particular, we show that ReLU activations lead to much lower quality reconstructions compared to smooth activation functions. We explore if this phenomenon is a fundamental property of models with ReLU activations, or if it is a weakness of current attack strategies. We first study the training dynamics of models with ReLU activations and identify redundant model parameters that do not memorise training examples. Building on this, we propose our Mnemonist method, which is able to detect redundant model parameters, and then guide current attacks to focus on informative parameters to improve the quality of reconstructions of training examples from ReLU models.

 Yassir Fathullah, Guoxuan Xia, Mark Gales  

  TL;DR:  Propose to distribution distill an autoregressive ensemble using a student Laplace distribution   Abstract:   
 Efficiently and reliably estimating uncertainty is an important objective in deep learning. It is especially pertinent to autoregressive sequence tasks, where training and inference costs are typically very high. However, existing research has predominantly focused on tasks with static data such as image classification. In this work, we investigate Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) applied to large-scale natural language sequence-to-sequence data. EDD aims to compress the superior uncertainty performance of an expensive (teacher) ensemble into a cheaper (student) single model. Importantly, the ability to separate knowledge (epistemic) and data (aleatoric) uncertainty is retained. Existing probability-space approaches to EDD, however, are difficult to scale to large vocabularies. We show, for modern transformer architectures on large-scale translation tasks, that modelling the ensemble \textit{logits}, instead of softmax probabilities, leads to significantly better students. Moreover, the students surprisingly even \textit{outperform Deep Ensembles} by up to $\sim$10\% AUROC on out-of-distribution detection, whilst matching them at in-distribution translation.

  TL;DR:  We provide algorithms, a regret lower bound, and experiments (synthetic and real data) for bandit problems where you need to pay a cost to observe the reward.   Abstract:   
 Many machine learning applications rely on large datasets that are conveniently collected from existing sources or that are labeled automatically as a by-product of user actions. However, in settings such as content moderation, accurately and reliably labeled data comes at substantial cost. If a learning algorithm has to pay for reward information, for example by asking a human for feedback, how does this change the exploration/exploitation tradeoff? We study this question in the context of bandit learning. Specifically, we investigate Bandits with Costly Reward Observations, where a cost needs to be paid in order to observe the reward of the bandit's action. We show that the observation cost implies an $\Omega(c^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ lower bound on the regret. Furthermore, we develop a general non-adaptive bandit algorithm which matches this lower bound, and we present several competitive adaptive learning algorithms for both k-armed and contextual bandits.

  TL;DR:  Combining Gaussian processes with spectral features of attributed graphs leads to surprisingly strong performance for the task of graph classification.   Abstract:   
 Graph classification aims to categorise graphs based on their structure and node attributes. In this work, we propose to tackle this task using tools from graph signal processing by deriving spectral features within the framework of Bayesian modelling with Gaussian processes. We present two variants of spectral Gaussian processes for graph classification. The first variant uses spectral features based on the distribution of energy of a node feature signal over the spectrum of the graph. We show that even such a simple approach, having no learnt parameters, can yield competitive performance compared to strong neural network and graph kernel baselines. A second, more sophisticated variant is designed to capture multi-scale and localised patterns in the graph by learning spectral graph wavelet filters, obtaining improved performance on synthetic and real-world data sets. Finally, we show that both models produce well calibrated uncertainty estimates, enabling reliable decision making based on the model predictions. 
 ID: 466 | Provably Efficient Representation Selection in Low-rank Markov Decision Processes: From Online to Offline RL   
  
 Weitong Zhang, Jiafan He, Dongruo Zhou, Amy Zhang, Quanquan Gu  

    Abstract:   
 The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) lies in its ability to learn a representation that is well-suited for the exploration and exploitation task. To understand how the choice of representation can improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), we study representation selection for a class of low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition kernel can be represented in a bilinear form. We propose an efficient algorithm, called ReLEX, for representation learning in both online and offline RL. Specifically, we show that the online version of ReLEX, calledReLEX-UCB, always performs no worse than the state-of-the-art algorithm without representation selection, and achieves a strictly better constant regret if the representation function class has a "coverage" property over the entire state-action space. For the offline counterpart, ReLEX-LCB, we show that the algorithm can find the optimal policy if the representation class can cover the state-action space and achieves gap-dependent sample complexity. This is the first result with constant sample complexity for representation learning in offline RL. 
 ID: 467 | Deep Gaussian Mixture Ensembles   
  
 Yousef El-Laham, Niccolo Dalmasso, Elizabeth Fons, Svitlana Vyetrenko  

    Abstract:   
 This work introduces a novel probabilistic deep learning technique called deep Gaussian mixture ensembles (DGMEs), which enables accurate quantification of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. By assuming the data generating process follows that of a Gaussian mixture, DGMEs are capable of approximating complex probability distributions, such as heavy tailed or multimodal distributions. Our contributions include the derivation of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used for learning the model parameters, which results in an upper-bound on the log-likelihood of training data over that of standard deep ensembles. Additionally, the proposed EM training procedure allows for learning of mixture weights, which is not commonly done in ensembles. Our experimental results demonstrate that DGMEs outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty quantifying deep learning models in handling complex predictive densities.

 Michael Y. Li, Erin Grant, Thomas L. Griffiths  

  TL;DR:  Interpretability and model selection for neural networks by learning a Gaussian process surrogate model for a neural network hyperparameter configuration.   Abstract:   
 Not being able to understand and predict the behavior of deep learning systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a given problem. In science and engineering, modeling is a methodology used to understand complex systems whose internal processes are opaque. Modeling replaces a complex system with a simpler surrogate that is more interpretable. Drawing inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our surrogate models can be used to solve practical problems such as identifying which points most influence the behavior of specific neural networks and predicting which architectures and algorithms will generalize well for specific datasets. 
 ID: 472 | Residual-Based Error Bound for Physics-Informed Neural Networks   
 [spotlight]  
 Shuheng Liu, Xiyue Huang, Pavlos Protopapas  

  TL;DR:  We propose algorithms to bound error of any PINN solution to linear ODEs, certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear PDEs. Only residual information and equation structure are required. No network architecture assumptions needed.   Abstract:   
 Neural networks are universal approximators and are studied for their use in solving differential equations. However, a major criticism is the lack of error bounds for obtained solutions. This paper proposes a technique to rigorously evaluate the error bound of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on most linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The error bound is based purely on equation structure and residual information and does not depend on assumptions of how well the networks are trained. We propose algorithms that bound the error efficiently. Some proposed algorithms provide tighter bounds than others at the cost of longer run time. 
 ID: 476 | Causal Inference With Outcome-Dependent Missingness And Self-Censoring   
 [spotlight]  
 Jacob Morris Chen, Daniel Malinsky, Rohit Bhattacharya  

  TL;DR:  We propose a method to estimate causal effects under outcome-dependent self-censoring and when the full structure of the causal graph is unknown.   Abstract:   
 We consider missingness in the context of causal inference when the outcome of interest may be missing. If the outcome directly affects its own missingness status, i.e., it is "self-censoring", this may lead to severely biased causal effect estimates. Miao et al., [2015] proposed the shadow variable method to correct for bias due to self-censoring, however, verifying the required model assumptions can be difficult. Here, we propose a test based on a randomized incentive variable offered to encourage reporting of the outcome that can be used to verify identification assumptions that are sufficient to correct for both self-censoring and confounding bias. Concretely, the test confirms whether a given set of pre-treatment covariates are sufficient to block all backdoor paths between the treatment and outcome as well as all paths between the treatment and missinginess indicator after conditioning on the outcome. We show that under these conditions, the causal effect is identified by using the treatment as a shadow variable, and it leads to an intuitive inverse probability weighting estimator that uses a product of the treatment and response weights. We evaluate the efficacy of our test and downstream estimator via simulations. 
 ID: 477 | Double Penalty Integration Estimator for Combining Randomized Experiments and Historical Controls

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Randomized experiments (REs) are the cornerstone for treatment effect evaluation. However, due to the practical considerations, REs may encounter difficulty recruiting sufficient patients. Historical controls (HCs) may supplement REs to boost estimation efficiency. Yet, it is possible that there is incomparability between HCs and CCs, resulting in misleading treatment effect evaluation. We introduce a new bias function to measure the difference between the outcome mean function between HCs and REs. We show that the ANCOVA model augmented the bias function for HCs renders a consistent estimator of the average treatment effect, regardless whether the ANCOVA model is correct or not. To accommodate possibly different structure of the ANCOVA model and the bias function, we propose a double penalty integration estimator (DPIE) with different penalization terms for the two functions. With an appropriate choice of penalty parameters, our DPIE ensures consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality even in the presence of model misspecification. DPIE is at least as efficient as the estimator derived from REs alone, which is validated through both theoretical and experimental results. 
 ID: 480 | Investigating a Generalization of Probabilistic Material Implication and Bayesian Conditional   
 [spotlight]  
 Matthias Scheutz, Michael Jahn  

  TL;DR:  We investigate properties of a generalized rule that subsumes probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals as special cases.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic "if A then B" rules are typically formalized as Bayesian conditionals P(B|A), as many (e.g., Pearl) have argued that Bayesian conditionals are the correct way to think about such rules. However, there are challenges with standard inferences such as modus ponens and modus tollens that might make probabilistic material implication a better candidate at times for rule-based systems employing forward-chaining; and arguably material implication is still suitable when information about prior or conditional probabilities is not available at all. We investigate a generalization of probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals that combines the advantages of both formalisms in a systematic way and prove basic properties of the generalized rule, in particular, for inference chains in graphs.

  TL;DR:  We show that the volume of a credal set is a good measure for epistemic uncertainty in a binary classification setting, while it ceases to be so in multi-class setting.   Abstract:   
 Adequate uncertainty representation and quantification have become imperative in various scientific disciplines, especially in machine learning and artificial intelligence. As an alternative to representing uncertainty via one single probability measure, we consider credal sets (convex sets of probability measures). The geometric representation of credal sets as $d$-dimensional polytopes implies a geometric intuition about (epistemic) uncertainty. In this paper, we show that in the case of binary classification, the volume of the geometric representation of a credal set is a good measure of epistemic uncertainty, while for multi-class classification it ceases to be appealing. Our theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of specifying and employing appropriate measures of uncertainty in machine learning tasks and generally call for awareness of possible pitfalls.

  TL;DR:  We propose the functional causal Bayesian optimization method for finding functional interventions that optimize a target variable in a known causal graph.   Abstract:   
 We propose the functional causal Bayesian optimization method (fCBO) for finding interventions that optimize a target variable in a known causal graph. fCBO extends CBO to perform, in addition to hard interventions, functional interventions which consist in setting a variable to be a deterministic function of a set of other variables in the graph. This is achieved by modelling the unknown objective with Gaussian processes whose inputs are defined in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, thus allowing to compute distances among vector-valued functions. In turn, this enables to sequentially select functions to explore by maximizing an expected improvement acquisition functional while keeping the typical computational tractability of standard BO settings. We show that functional interventions can attain better target effects compared to hard interventions and ensure that the found optimal policy is also optimal for sub-groups. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in a synthetic setting and in a real-world causal graph. 
 ID: 494 | Uniform-PAC Guarantees for Model-Based RL with Bounded Eluder Dimension   
  
 Yue Wu, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu  

  TL;DR:  We propose uniform-PAC, model-based algorithms for both bandit and episodic RL with the notion of eluder dimension.   Abstract:   
 Recently, there has been remarkable progress in reinforcement learning (RL) with general function approximation. However, all these works only provide regret or sample complexity guarantees. It is still an open question if one can achieve stronger performance guarantees, i.e., the uniform probably approximate correctness (Uniform-PAC) guarantee that can imply both a sub-linear regret bound and a polynomial sample complexity for any target learning accuracy. We study this problem by proposing algorithms for both nonlinear bandits and model-based episodic RL using the general function class with a bounded eluder dimension. The key idea of the proposed algorithms is to assign each action to different levels according to its width with respect to the confidence set. The achieved uniform-PAC sample complexity is tight in the sense that it matches the state-of-the-art regret bounds or sample complexity guarantees when reduced to the linear case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for uniform-PAC guarantees on bandit and RL that goes beyond linear cases.

 Xiaolin Sun, Jacob Masur, Ben Abramowitz, Nicholas Mattei, Zizhan Zheng  

  TL;DR:  We formalize and study a novel model of election attack, pandering, where candidates report their positions strategically and study the complexity of and algorithms for reasoning in this domain.   Abstract:   
 In representative democracies, the election of new representatives in regular election cycles is meant to prevent misbehavior by elected officials and keep them accountable to the ``will of the people." This ideal is undermined when candidates are dishonest when campaigning for election over these rounds. Much of the work on COMSOC to date has investigated strategic actions in only a single round. We introduce a novel formal model of pandering, or strategic preference reporting by candidates, and examine the resilience of two voting systems, Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), to pandering within a single round and across multiple rounds. For each voting system, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the candidates have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of pandering in our setting for a single cycle, formulate our problem for multiple cycles as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement learning to study the effects of pandering by both single candidates and groups of candidates across a number of rounds. 
 ID: 496 | Sample Boosting Algorithm (SamBA) - An Interpretable Greedy Ensemble Classifier Based On Local Expertise For Fat Data   
  
 Baptiste Bauvin, Cécile Capponi, Florence Clerc, Pascal Germain, Sokol Koço, Jacques Corbeil  

  TL;DR:  We porpose a framewok and an algorithm to include local knowledge in boosting, with thoeretical and experiemental guarantees.   Abstract:   
 Ensemble methods are a very diverse family of algorithms with a wide range of applications. One of the most commonly used is boosting, with the prominent Adaboost. Adaboost relies on greedily learning base classifiers that rectify the error from previous iteration. Then, it combines them through a weighted majority vote, based on their quality on the learning set. In this paper, we propose a supervised binary classification framework that propagates the local knowledge acquired during the boosting iterations to the prediction function. Based on this general framework, we introduce SamBA, an interpretable greedy ensemble method designed for fat datasets with a large number of dimensions and a small number of samples. SamBA learns local classifiers and combines them, using a similarity function, to optimize its efficiency in data extraction. We provide a theoretical analysis of SamBA, yielding convergence and generalization guarantees. In addition, we highlight SamBA's empirical behavior in an extensive experimental analysis on both real biological and generated datasets, comparing it to state-of-the-art ensemble methods and similarity-based approaches. 
 ID: 499 | Hallucinated Adversarial Control for Conservative Offline Policy Evaluation   
  
 Jonas Rothfuss, Bhavya Sukhija, Tobias Birchler, Parnian Kassraie, Andreas Krause  

  TL;DR:  A practical method for conservative off-policy evaluation, useful for safety critical applications.   Abstract:   
 We study the problem of conservative off-policy evaluation (COPE) where given an offline dataset of environment interactions, collected by other agents, we seek to obtain a (tight) lower bound on a policy's performance. This is crucial when deciding whether a given policy satisfies certain minimal performance/safety criteria before it can be deployed in the real world. To this end, we introduce HAMBO, which builds on an uncertainty-aware learned model of the transition dynamics. To form a conservative estimate of the policy's performance, HAMBO hallucinates worst-case trajectories that the policy may take, within the margin of the models' epistemic confidence regions. We prove that the resulting COPE estimates are valid lower bounds, and, under regularity conditions, show their convergence to the true expected return. Finally, we discuss scalable variants of our approach based on Bayesian Neural Networks and empirically demonstrate that they yield reliable and tight lower bounds in various continuous control environments. 
 ID: 500 | The Past Does Matter: Correlation of Subsequent States in Trajectory Predictions of Gaussian Process Models   
  
 Steffen Ridderbusch, Sina Ober-Blöbaum, Paul James Goulart  

  TL;DR:  Predicting trajectories with uncertainty is challenging and we show an approximate way to do it while including correlation with past states.   Abstract:   
 Computing the distribution of trajectories from a Gaussian Process model of a dynamical system is an important challenge in utilizing such models. Motivated by the computational cost of sampling-based approaches, we consider approximations of the model's output and trajectory distribution. We show that previous work on uncertainty propagation, focussed on discrete state-space models, incorrectly included an independence assumption between subsequent states of the predicted trajectories. Expanding these ideas to continuous ordinary differential equation models, we illustrate the implications of this assumption and propose a novel piecewise linear approximation of Gaussian Processes to mitigate them.

  TL;DR:  We address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue   Abstract:   
 Proper confidence calibration of deep neural networks is essential in safety-critical tasks for reliable predictions. Miscalibration can lead to model over-confidence and/or under-confidence; i.e., the predicted confidence can be greater or less than model accuracy. Recent studies have highlighted the over-confidence issue by introducing calibration techniques and demonstrated success on various tasks. However, miscalibration through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper, we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions. Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence. We report extensive experiments that show that our proposed methods substantially outperform existing calibration techniques. We also validate the automatic failure detection of the proposed calibration technique using our class-wise miscalibration score with a risk-coverage curve. Results show that our methods significantly improve failure detection as well as trustworthiness of the model.

  TL;DR:  A new ancestral perspective on the Cyclic Equivalence Theorem leads to a simplified and much faster procedure to decide on Markov equivalence between directed cyclic graphs.   Abstract:   
 We present a new, efficient procedure to establish Markov equivalence between directed graphs that may or may not contain cycles. It is based on the Cyclic Equivalence Theorem (CET) in the seminal works on cyclic models by Thomas Richardson in the mid '90s, but now rephrased from an ancestral perspective. The resulting characterization leads to a procedure for establishing Markov equivalence between graphs that no longer requires explicit tests for \textit{d}-separation, leading to a significantly reduced algorithmic complexity. The conceptually simplified characterization may help to reinvigorate theoretical research towards sound and complete cyclic discovery in the presence of latent confounders. 
 ID: 505 | ASTRA: Understanding the Practical Impact of Robustness for Probabilistic Programs   
  
 Zixin Huang, Saikat Dutta, Sasa Misailovic  

    Abstract:   
 We present the first systematic study of effectiveness of robustness transformations on a diverse set of 24 probabilistic programs representing generalized linear models, mixture models, and time-series models. We evaluate five robustness transformations from literature on each model. We quantify and present insights on (1) the improvement of the posterior prediction accuracy and (2) the execution time overhead of the robustified programs, in the presence of three input noise models. To automate the evaluation of various robustness transformations, we developed ASTRA ‚Äì a novel framework for quantifying the robustness of probabilistic programs and exploring the trade-offs between robustness and execution time. Our experimental results indicate that the existing transformations are often suitable only for specific noise models, can significantly increase execution time, and have non-trivial interaction with the inference algorithms.

  TL;DR:  Better certified segmentation leveraging randomized smoothing as well as off-the-shelf denoising diffusion and segmentation models.   Abstract:   
 The robustness of image segmentation has been an important research topic in the past few years as segmentation models have reached production-level accuracy. However, like classification models, segmentation models can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which hinders their use in critical-decision systems like healthcare or autonomous driving. Recently, randomized smoothing has been proposed to certify segmentation predictions by adding Gaussian noise to the input to obtain theoretical guarantees. Nonetheless, this method exhibits a trade-off between the amount of added noise and the level of certification achieved. In this paper, we address the problem of certifying segmentation prediction using a combination of randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our experiments show that combining randomized smoothing and diffusion models significantly improves certified robustness, with results indicating a mean improvement of 21 points in accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-Context and Cityscapes public datasets. Our method is independent of the selected segmentation model and does not need any additional specialized training procedure. Our pipeline and code will be made publicly available online.

    Abstract:   
 Text classifiers built on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question-answering. However, these text classifiers sometimes make uncertain predictions, which challenges their trustworthiness during deployment in practical applications. Much effort has been devoted to designing various probes in order to understand what PLMs capture. But few works have explored factors influencing PLM-based classifiers' predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework CUE for interpreting uncertainties of PLM-based models' predictions. In particular, we first map PLM-encoded representations to a latent space via a variational auto-encoder. We then generate text representations by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in predictive uncertainty. By comparing the predictive uncertainty difference between the perturbed text representation and the original text representation, we are able to identify the latent dimensions that cause uncertainty and thus trace back to input features that lead to uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for linguistic acceptability classification, emotion classification, and natural language inference show the feasibility of our proposed framework.

    Abstract:   
 The Right to Explanation is an important regulatory principle which allows individuals to request actionable explanations for algorithmic decisions. However, several technical challenges arise when providing such actionable explanations in practice. For instance, models are periodically retrained to handle dataset shifts, and this may in turn invalidate some of the previously prescribed explanations thus rendering them unactionable. But, it is unclear if and when such invalidations occur, and what factors determine explanation stability i.e., if an explanation remains unchanged amidst model retraining due to dataset shifts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned gaps and provide one of the first theoretical and empirical characterizations of the factors influencing explanation stability. To this end, we conduct rigorous theoretical analysis to demonstrate that model curvature and robustness, weight decay parameters, and the magnitude of the dataset shift are key factors that determine the extent of explanation (in)stability. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets not only validates our theoretical results, but also demonstrates that the aforementioned factors dramatically impact the stability of explanations produced by various state-of-the-art methods. 
 ID: 520 | Improvable Gap Balancing for Multi-Task Learning   
  
 Yanqi Dai, Nanyi Fei, Zhiwu Lu  

  TL;DR:  We propose two novel improvable gap balancing algorithms for multi-task learning, instead of the classic loss balancing strategy.   Abstract:   
 In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient balancing has recently attracted more research interest than loss balancing since it often leads to better performance. However, loss balancing is much more efficient than gradient balancing, and thus it is still worth further exploration in MTL. Note that prior studies typically ignore that there exist varying improvable gaps across multiple tasks, where the improvable gap per task is defined as the distance between the current training progress and desired final training progress. Therefore, after loss balancing, the performance imbalance still arises in many cases. In this paper, following the loss balancing framework, we propose two novel improvable gap balancing (IGB) algorithms for MTL: one takes a simple heuristic, and the other (for the first time) deploys deep reinforcement learning for MTL. Particularly, instead of directly balancing the losses in MTL, both algorithms choose to dynamically assign task weights for improvable gap balancing. Moreover, since IGB is shown to be complementary to gradient balancing, we also provide a fusion paradigm to combine both loss balancing and gradient balancing for MTL. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IGB algorithms lead to the best results in MTL via loss balancing and achieve further improvements when combined with gradient balancing.

  TL;DR:  Causal perspectives to distribution shift robustness break down when we only have proxies for the causal model, but training auxiliary tasks can help.   Abstract:   
 Statistical prediction models are often trained on data that is drawn from different probability distributions than their eventual use cases. One approach to proactively prepare for these shifts harnesses the intuition that causal mechanisms should remain invariant between environments. Here we focus on a challenging setting in which the causal and anticausal variables of the target are unobserved. Leaning on information theory, we develop feature selection and engineering techniques for the observed downstream variables that act as proxies. We identify proxies that help to build stable models and moreover utilize auxiliary training tasks to extract stability-enhancing information from proxies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on synthetic and real data. 
 ID: 524 | A One-Sample Decentralized Proximal Algorithm for Non-Convex Stochastic Composite Optimization   
  
 Tesi Xiao, Xuxing Chen, Krishna Balasubramanian, Saeed Ghadimi  

    Abstract:   
 We focus on decentralized stochastic non-convex optimization, where $n$ agents work together to optimize a composite objective function which is a sum of a smooth term and a non-smooth convex term. To solve this problem, we propose two single-time scale algorithms: Prox-DASA and Prox-DASA-GT. These algorithms can find $\epsilon$-stationary points in $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations using constant batch sizes (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(1)$). Unlike prior work, our algorithms achieve a comparable complexity result without requiring large batch sizes, more complex per-iteration operations (such as double loops), or stronger assumptions. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive numerical experiments, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over previous approaches.

  TL;DR:  A principled approach to building expressive and tractable generative models by integrating normalizing flows with probabilistic circuits.   Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of increasing the expressivity of probabilistic circuits by augmenting them with the successful generative models of normalizing flows. To this effect, we theoretically establish the requirement of decomposability for such combinations to retain tractability of the learned models. Our model, called Probabilistic Flow Circuits, essentially extends circuits by allowing for normalizing flows at the leaves. Our empirical evaluation clearly establishes the expressivity and tractability of this new class of probabilistic circuits. 
 ID: 527 | A Data-Driven State Aggregation Approach for Dynamic Discrete Choice Models   
  
 Sinong Geng, houssam nassif, Charlie Manzanares  

    Abstract:   
 We study dynamic discrete choice models, where a commonly studied problem involves estimating parameters of agent reward functions (also known as "structural" parameters), using agent behavior data. Maximum likelihood estimation for such models requires dynamic programming, which incurs the curse of dimensionality [Bellman, 1957]. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that provides a data-driven method for selecting and aggregating states, which lowers the computational and sample complexity of estimation. Our method works in two stages. In the first stage, we use a flexible inverse reinforcement learning approach to estimate agent Q-functions. We use these estimated Q-functions, along with a clustering algorithm, to select a subset of states that are the most pivotal for driving changes in Q functions. In the second stage, with these selected "aggregated" states, we conduct maximum likelihood estimation using a commonly used nested fixed-point algorithm [Rust, 1987]. The proposed two-stage approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality by reducing the problem dimension. Theoretically, we derive finite-sample bounds on the associated estimation error, which also characterize the trade-off of computational complexity, estimation error, and sample complexity. We demonstrate the empirical performance of the algorithm in two classic dynamic discrete choice estimation applications.

  TL;DR:  A theoretically-sound algorithm for probabilistically robust conformal prediction which ensures robust uncertainty quantification to most perturbations around clean input examples.   Abstract:   
 Conformal prediction (CP) is a framework to quantify uncertainty of machine learning classifiers including deep neural networks. Given a testing example and a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with a user-specified coverage (i.e., true class label is contained with high probability). Almost all the existing work on CP assumes clean testing data and there is not much known about the robustness of CP algorithms w.r.t natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This paper studies the problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP) which ensures robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP generalizes the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust CP (ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. We propose a novel adaptive PRCP (aPRCP) algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage. The key idea behind aPRCP is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data samples and another one for the perturbations on data (aka "quantile-of-quantile'' design). We provide theoretical analysis to show that aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using deep neural networks demonstrate that aPRCP achieves better trade-offs than state-of-the-art CP and adversarially robust CP algorithms.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of maximizing submodular functions under submodular constraints by formulating the problem in two ways: SCSK-C and Diff-C. Given two submodular functions $f$ and $g$ where $f$ is monotone, the objective of SCSK-C problem is to find a set $S$ of size at most $k$ that maximizes $f(S)$ under the constraint that $g(S)\leq \theta$, for a given value of $\theta$. The problem of Diff-C focuses on finding a set $S$ of size at most $k$ such that $h(S) = f(S)-g(S)$ is maximized. It is known that these problems are highly inapproximable and do not admit any constant factor multiplicative approximation algorithms unless NP is easy. Known approximation algorithms involve data-dependent approximation factors that are not efficiently computable. We initiate a study of the design of approximation algorithms where the approximation factors are efficiently computable. For the problem of SCSK-C, we prove that the greedy algorithm produces a solution whose value is at least $(1-1/e)f(OPT) - A$, where $A$ is the data-dependent additive error. For the Diff-C problem, we design an algorithm that uses the SCSK-C greedy algorithm as a subroutine. This algorithm produces a solution whose value is at least $(1-1/e)h(OPT)-B$, where $B$ is also a data-dependent additive error. A salient feature of our approach is that the additive error terms can be computed efficiently, thus enabling us to ascertain the quality of the solutions produced.

  TL;DR:  We propose a version of a security game that takes into account a possibility of a two-phase attack.   Abstract:   
 A standard model of a security game assumes a one-off assault during which the attacker cannot update their strategy even if new actionable insights are gained in the process. In this paper, we propose a version of a security game that takes into account a possibility of a two-phase attack. Specifically, in the first phase, the attacker makes a preliminary move to gain extra information about this particular instance of the game. Based on this information, the attacker chooses an optimal concluding move. We derive a compact-form mixed-integer linear program that computes an optimal strategy of the defender. Our simulation shows that this strategy mitigates serious losses incurred to the defender by a two-phase attack while still protecting well against less sophisticated attackers. 
 ID: 536 | Bounding the Optimal Value Function in Compositional Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Jacob Adamczyk, Volodymyr Makarenko, Argenis Arriojas, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V Kulkarni  

  TL;DR:  We derive double-sided bounds on the optimal value function for compositions of primitive tasks.   Abstract:   
 In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), agents are often tasked with solving a variety of problems differing only in their reward functions. In order to quickly obtain solutions to unseen problems with new reward functions, a popular approach involves functional composition of previously solved tasks. However, previous work using such functional composition has primarily focused on specific instances of composition functions, whose limiting assumptions allow for exact zero-shot composition. Our work unifies these examples and provides a more general framework for compositionality in both standard and entropy-regularized RL. We find that, for a broad class of functions, the optimal solution for the composite task of interest can be related to the known primitive task solutions. Specifically, we present double-sided inequalities relating the optimal composite value function to the value functions for the primitive tasks. We also show that the regret of using a zero-shot policy can be bounded for this class of functions. The derived bounds can be used to develop clipping approaches for reducing uncertainty during training, allowing agents to quickly adapt to new tasks.

    Abstract:   
 Nash Q-learning may be considered one of the first and most known algorithms in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for learning policies that constitute a Nash equilibrium of an underlying general-sum Markov game. Its original proof was in the asymptotic domain and for the tabular case. Recently, finite-sample guarantees have been provided using more modern RL techniques for the tabular case. Our work analyzes Nash Q-learning using linear function approximation ‚Äì a representation regime introduced when the state space is large or continuous ‚Äì and provides finite-sample guarantees that indicate its sample efficiency. We find that the obtained performance nearly matches an existing efficient result for single-agent RL under the same representation and has a polynomial gap when compared to the best-known result for the tabular case.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  This is the first work performing Bayesian inference on vertex-series-parallel partial orders (VSP's). We propose a prior over VSP's and extend an existing observation model for queue-like noisy rank data.   Abstract:   
 Partial orders are a natural model for the social hierarchies that may constrain ``queue-like'' rank data. However, the computational cost of counting the LE's of a general partial order on a ground set with more than a few tens of elements is prohibitive. Vertex-series-parallel partial orders (VSP's) are a subclass of partial orders which admit rapid counting and represent the sorts of relations we expect to see in a social hierarchy. However, no Bayesian analysis of VSP's has been given to date. We construct a marginally consistent family of priors over VSP's with a parameter controlling the prior distribution over VSP depth. The distribution function is given in closed form. We extend an existing observation model for queue-like rank data to represent noise in our list-data and carry out Bayesian inference on rank lists from ``Royal Acta'' data. Model comparison shows our model is a better fit to the data and also compares favorably with a Plackett-Luce mixture.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We prove a high-probability bound for the instantaneous swap regret with respect to the randmoness of both learner and adversaries.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we study a multi-agent bandit problem in an unknown general-sum game repeated for a number of rounds~(i.e., learning in a black-box game with bandit feedback), where a set of agents have no information about the underlying game structure and cannot observe each other's actions and rewards. In each round, each agent needs to play an arm~(i.e., action) from a (possibly different) arm set~(i.e., action set), and \emph{only} receives the reward of the \emph{played} arm that is affected by other agents' actions. The objective of each agent is to minimize her own cumulative swap regret, where the swap regret is a generic performance measure for online learning algorithms. We are the first to give a near-optimal high-probability swap-regret upper bound based on a refined martingale analysis for the exponential-weighting-based algorithms with the implicit exploration technique, which can further bound the expected swap regret instead of the pseudo-regret studied in the literature. It is also guaranteed that correlated equilibria can be achieved in a polynomial number of rounds if the algorithm is played by all agents. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to verify the performance of the studied algorithm.

  TL;DR:  We propose an algorithm to learn cutset networks from sparse and noisy data using qualitative influences   Abstract:   
 Cutset networks (CNs) are interpretable probabilistic representations that combine probability trees and tree Bayesian networks, to model and reason about large multi-dimensional probability distributions. Motivated by high-stakes applications in domains such as healthcare where (a) rich domain knowledge in the form of qualitative influences is readily available and (b) use of interpretable models that the user can efficiently probe and infer over is often necessary, we focus on learning CNs in the presence of qualitative influences. We propose a penalized objective function that uses the influences as constraints, and develop a gradient-based learning algorithm, KICN. We show that because CNs are tractable, KICN is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the penalized objective function. Our experiments on several benchmark data sets show that our new algorithm is superior to the LearnCNet algorithm proposed in previous work, especially when the data is scarce or noisy. 
 ID: 551 | Why Out-of-Distribution Detection Experiments Are Not Reliable - Subtle Experimental Artifacts Muddle the OOD Detector Rankings   
  
 Kamil Szyc, Tomasz Walkowiak, Henryk Maciejewski  

  TL;DR:  We identify experimental artifacts in OOD detection benchmark studies, so we question the reliability of OOD detector rankings.   Abstract:   
 Reliable detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is becoming a critical requirement for machine learning systems deployed in safety-critical applications. Recently, many OOD detectors have been developed in the literature, and their performance has been evaluated using empirical studies based on well-established benchmark datasets. However, these studies do not provide a conclusive recommendation because the performance of OOD detection depends on the benchmark datasets. In this work, we want to question the reliability of the OOD detection performance numbers obtained from many of these empirical experiments. We report several experimental conditions that are not controlled and lead to significant changes in OOD detector performance and rankings of OOD methods. These include the technicalities related to how the DNN was trained (such as seed, train/test split, etc.), which do not change the accuracy of closed-set DNN models but may significantly change the performance of OOD detection methods that rely on representation from these DNNs. We performed extensive sensitivity studies to quantify the instability of OOD performance measures due to unintuitive experimental artifacts, which need to be more rigorously controlled and accounted for in many current OOD experiments. Experimental studies in OOD detection should improve methodological standards regarding experiment control and replication.

  TL;DR:  We encourage the community to view transformer-based offline reinforcement learning approach from a multimodal perspective.   Abstract:   
 Transformers hold tremendous promise in solving offline reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating it as a sequence modeling problem derived from language modeling (LM). Prior works using transformers usually model the sample trajectory of RL as one sequence analogous to one sentence in LM, despite the fact that each trajectory includes tokens from three diverse modalities: state, action, and reward while a sentence contains words only. Rather than taking a modality-agnostic approach which uniformly models the tokens from different modalities into one sequence, we propose a multimodal sequence modeling approach in which a trajectory (one sentence) of three modalities (state, action, reward) is disentangled into three uni-modal ones (three sentences). We investigate the correlation of different modalities during sequential decision-making and use the insights to design our multimodal transformer, named Decision Transducer (DTd). DTd outperforms prior art in offline RL on the D4RL benchmarks and enjoys better sample efficiency and algorithm flexibility. 
 ID: 554 | Efficiently Learning the Graph for Semi-supervised Learning   
  
 Dravyansh Sharma, Maxwell Jones  

  TL;DR:  We show how to efficiently learning the graph (Gaussian bandwidth) parameter in classic semi-supervised learning, by exploiting sparsity and conjugate gradient approximations.   Abstract:   
 Computational efficiency is a major bottleneck in using classic graph-based approaches for semi-supervised learning on datasets with a large number of unlabeled examples. Known techniques to improve efficiency typically involve an approximation of the graph regularization objective, but suffer two major drawbacks ‚Äì first the graph is assumed to be known or constructed with heuristic hyperparameter values, second they do not provide a principled approximation guarantee for learning over the full unlabeled dataset. Building on recent work on learning graphs for semi-supervised learning from multiple datasets for problems from the same domain, and leveraging techniques for fast approximations for solving linear systems in the graph Laplacian matrix, we propose algorithms that overcome both the above limitations. We show a formal separation in the learning-theoretic complexity of sparse and dense graph families. We further show how to approximately learn the best graphs from the sparse families efficiently using the conjugate gradient method. Our approach can also be used to learn the graph efficiently online with sub-linear regret, under mild smoothness assumptions. Our online learning results are stated generally, and may be useful for approximate and efficient parameter tuning in other problems. We implement our approach and demonstrate significant (~10-100x) speedups over prior work on semi-supervised learning with learned graphs on benchmark datasets. 
 ID: 555 | KrADagrad: Kronecker Approximation-Domination Gradient Preconditioned Stochastic Optimization   
  
 Jonathan Mei, Alexander Moreno, Luke Walters  

  TL;DR:  Second order optimizer that avoids matrix inversion   Abstract:   
 Second order stochastic optimizers allow parameter update step size and direction to adapt to loss curvature, but have traditionally required too much memory and compute for deep learning. Recently, Shampoo [Gupta et al., 2018] introduced a Kronecker factored preconditioner to reduce these requirements: it is used for large deep models [Anil et al., 2020] and in production [Anil et al., 2022]. However, it takes inverse matrix roots of ill-conditioned matrices. This requires 64-bit precision, imposing strong hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization, Kronecker Approximation-Domination (KrAD). Using KrAD, we update a matrix that directly approximates the inverse empirical Fisher matrix (like full matrix AdaGrad), avoiding inversion and hence 64-bit precision. We then propose KrADagrad$^\star$, with similar computational costs to Shampoo and the same regret. Synthetic ill-conditioned experiments show improved performance over Shampoo for 32-bit precision, while for several real datasets we have comparable or better generalization. 
 ID: 556 | Fast and Scalable Score-Based Kernel Calibration Tests   
 [spotlight]  
 Pierre Glaser, David Widmann, Fredrik Lindsten, Arthur Gretton  

  TL;DR:  We introduce a Fast and Scalable Score-Based Kernel Calibration Test.   Abstract:   
 We introduce the Kernel Calibration Conditional Stein Discrepancy test (KCCSD test), a nonparametric, kernel-based test for assessing the calibration of probabilistic models with well-defined scores. In contrast to previous methods, our test avoids the need for possibly expensive expectation approximations while providing control over its type-I error. We achieve these improvements by using a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be estimated without probability density samples, and by using a Conditional Goodness of Fit criterion for the KCCSD test's U-statistic. The tractability of the KCCSD test widens the surface area of calibration measures to new promising use-cases, such as regularization during model training. We demonstrate the properties of our test on various synthetic settings. 
 ID: 558 | Neural Tangent Kernel at Initialization: Linear Width Suffices   
  
 Arindam Banerjee, Pedro Cisneros-Velarde, Libin Zhu, Misha Belkin  

    Abstract:   
 In this paper we study the problem of lower bounding the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) at initialization, an important quantity for the theoretical analysis of training in neural networks. We consider feedforward neural networks with smooth activation functions. Without any distributional assumptions on the input, we present a novel result: we show that for suitable initialization variance, $\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ width, where $n$ is the number of training samples, suffices to ensure that the NTK at initialization is positive definite, improving prior results for smooth activations under our setting. Prior to our work, the sufficiency of linear width has only been shown either for networks with ReLU activation functions, and sublinear width has been shown for smooth networks but with additional conditions on the distribution of the data. The technical challenge in the analysis stems from the layerwise inhomogeneity of smooth activation functions and we handle the challenge using generalized Hermite series expansion of such activations. 
 ID: 559 | "Private Prediction Strikes Back!" Private Kernelized Nearest Neighbors with Individual R\'{e}nyi Filter   
 [spotlight]  
 Yuqing Zhu, Xuandong Zhao, Chuan Guo, Yu-Xiang Wang  

  TL;DR:  We propose a new private prediction mechanism that easily adapted to the changing private dataset and improve over existing private prediction methods.   Abstract:   
 Most existing approaches of differentially private (DP) machine learning focus on private training. Despite its many advantages, private training lacks the flexibility in adapting to incremental changes to the training dataset such as deletion requests from exercising GDPR‚Äôs right to be forgotten. We revisit a long-forgotten alternative, known as private prediction, and propose a new algorithm named Individual Kernelized Nearest Neighbor (Ind-KNN). Ind-KNN is easily updatable over dataset changes and it allows precise control of the R\'{e}nyi DP at an individual user level --- a user's privacy loss is measured by the exact amount of her contribution to predictions; and a user is removed if her prescribed privacy budget runs out. Our results show that Ind-KNN consistently improves the accuracy over existing private prediction methods for a wide range of $\epsilon$ on four vision and language tasks. We also illustrate several cases under which Ind-KNN is preferable over private training with NoisySGD. 
 ID: 560 | Online Heavy-tailed Change-point detection   
  
 Abishek Sankararaman, Murali Balakrishnan  

  TL;DR:  We give the first algorithm to have provable false positive rate for online change point detection with heavy tailed data   Abstract:   
 We study algorithms for online sequential change-point detection, where samples are presented one at a time, a change in the underlying mean must be detected as early as possible, and the data distribution could be heavy tailed. We present an algorithm based on clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that works even if we only assume that the second moment of the data generating process is bounded. We derive guarantees on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate (FPR) over the family of all distributions with bounded second moment. Thus, our method is the first online change point detection mechanism that guarantees finite-sample FPR, even if the underlying observations are drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. The technical contribution of our paper is to show that clipped-SGD can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provide confidence bounds at all confidence values. We use this robust estimate via a simple union bound and construct a sequential change-point algorithm with finite-sample FPR guarantees. We further demonstrate through simulations that our algorithm works well in a variety of situations whether the underlying data are heavy-tailed, light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete. No other algorithm achieves bounded FPR theoretically or empirically, over all the settings we study simultaneously. 
 ID: 561 | Fairness-Aware Class Imbalanced Learning on Multiple Subgroups   
  
 Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Bojian Hou, Boning Tong, Qi Long, Li Shen  

    Abstract:   
 Overparameterized models fail to generalize well in the presence of data imbalance even when combined with standard re-weighting and margin adjustment of loss for mitigating imbalances. This concern is further exacerbated when the data contains multiple or even \textit{many} subgroups, each with a \textit{limited number of samples}. We design a Bayesian-based three-level optimization framework to improve the performance in such scenarios. In the middle and lower levels, the \textit{local} (subgroup-specific) predictors are learned through a small amount of training data and the fair and class-balanced predictor. Specifically, our lower-level formulation uses sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm to effectively escape saddle points for minority classes. The upper-level problem automatically tunes the loss function by monitoring the validation loss and updates the \textit{global} predictor to be close to all local predictors. We theoretically show that our method leads to the potentially improved generalization bound. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of our three-level framework over state-of-the-art approaches.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  This paper describes a unified active query framework that can be applied to any problem which involves learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity.   Abstract:   
 Active learning is commonly used to train label-efficient models by adaptively selecting the most informative queries. However, most active learning strategies are designed to either learn a representation of the data (e.g., embedding or metric learning) or perform well on a task (e.g., classification) on the data. However, many machine learning tasks involve a combination of both representation learning and a task-specific goal. Motivated by this, we propose a novel unified query framework that can be applied to any problem in which a key component is learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity. Our approach builds on similarity or nearest neighbor (NN) queries which seek to select samples that result in improved embeddings. The queries consist of a reference and a set of objects, with an oracle selecting the object most similar (i.e., nearest) to the reference. In order to reduce the number of solicited queries, they are chosen adaptively according to an information theoretic criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on two tasks -- active metric learning and active classification -- using a variety of synthetic and real world datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that actively selected NN queries outperform recently developed active triplet selection methods in a deep metric learning setting. Further, we show that in classification, actively selecting class labels can be reformulated as a process of selecting the most informative NN query, allowing direct application of our method. 
 ID: 567 | On the Convergence of Continual Learning with Adaptive Methods   
  
 Seungyub Han, Yeongmo Kim, Taehyun Cho, Jungwoo Lee  

    Abstract:   
 One of the objectives of continual learning is to prevent catastrophic forgetting in learning multiple tasks sequentially, and the existing solutions have been driven by the conceptualization of the plasticity-stability dilemma. However, the convergence of continual learning for each sequential task is less studied so far. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of memory-based continual learning with stochastic gradient descent and empirical evidence that training current tasks causes the cumulative degradation of previous tasks. We propose an adaptive method for nonconvex continual learning (NCCL), which adjusts step sizes of both previous and current tasks with the gradients. The proposed method can achieve the same convergence rate as the SGD method when the catastrophic forgetting term which we define in the paper is suppressed at each iteration. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of continual learning over existing methods for several image classification tasks. 
 ID: 571 | Robust Quickest Change Detection for Unnormalized Models   
  
 Suya Wu, Enmao Diao, Taposh Banerjee, Jie Ding, Vahid Tarokh  

  TL;DR:  We propose a new robust score-based quickest change detection algorithm that can be applied to unnormalized models.   Abstract:   
 Detecting an abrupt and persistent change in the underlying distribution of online data streams is an important problem in many applications. This paper proposes a new robust score-based algorithm called RSCUSUM, which can be applied to unnormalized models and addresses the issue of unknown post-change distributions. RSCUSUM replaces the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the Fisher divergence between pre- and post-change distributions for computational efficiency in unnormalized statistical models and introduces a notion of the ``least favorable'' distribution for robust change detection. The algorithm and its theoretical analysis are demonstrated through simulation studies. 
 ID: 576 | Identifiability and Estimation under Missing Not at Random Mechanisms   
  
 Anna Guo, Jiwei Zhao, Razieh Nabi  

    Abstract:   
 Conducting valid statistical analyses is challenging in the presence of missing-not-at-random (MNAR) data, where the missingness mechanism is dependent on the missing values themselves even conditioned on the observed data. Here, we consider a MNAR model that generalizes several prior popular MNAR models in two ways: first, it is less restrictive in terms of statistical independence assumptions imposed on the underlying joint data distribution, and second, it allows for all variables in the observed sample to have missing values. This MNAR model corresponds to a so-called criss-cross structure considered in the literature on graphical models of missing data that prevents nonparametric identification of the entire missing data model. Nonetheless, part of the complete-data distribution remains nonparametrically identifiable. By exploiting this fact and considering a rich class of exponential family distributions, we establish sufficient conditions for identification of the complete-data distribution as well as the entire missingness mechanism. We then propose methods for testing the independence restrictions encoded in such models using odds ratio as our parameter of interest. We adopt two semiparametric approaches for estimating the odds ratio parameter and establish the corresponding asymptotic theories: one involves maximizing a conditional likelihood with order statistics and the other uses estimating equations. The utility of our methods is illustrated via simulation studies. 
 ID: 579 | Optimistic Thompson Sampling-based Algorithms for Episodic Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Bingshan Hu, Tianyue H. Zhang, Nidhi Hegde, Mark Schmidt  
   
    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 We propose two Thompson Sampling-like, model-based learning algorithms for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a finite time horizon. Our proposed algorithms are inspired by Optimistic Thompson Sampling (O-TS) previously empirically studied in Chapelle and Li [2011], May et al. [2012] for stochastic multi-armed bandits. The key idea for the original O-TS is to clip the posterior distribution in an optimistic way. Both of our proposed algorithms are easy to implement and only need one posterior sample to construct an episode-dependent model. Our first algorithm, Optimistic Thompson Sampling for MDPs (O-TS-MDP), achieves a $\widetilde{O} \left(\sqrt{AS^2H^4T} \right)$ regret bound, where $S$ is the size of the state space, $A$ is the size of the action space, $H$ is the number of time-steps per episode and $T$ is the number of episodes. Our second algorithm, Optimistic Thompson Sampling plus for MDPs (O-TS-MDP$^+$), achieves the (near)-optimal $\widetilde{O} \left(\sqrt{ASH^3T} \right)$ regret bound by taking a more aggressive clipping strategy. Since O-TS was only empirically studied before, we derive regret bounds of O-TS for stochastic bandits. In addition, we propose, O-TS-Bandit$^+$, for stochastic bandits. Both O-TS and O-TS-Bandit$^+$ achieve the optimal $O\left(\frac{A\ln(T)}{\Delta} \right)$ problem-dependent regret bound, where $\Delta$ denotes the sub-optimality gap. 
 ID: 580 | Short-term Temporal Dependency Detection under Heterogeneous Event Dynamic with Hawkes Processes   
  
 Yu Chen, Fengpei Li, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Asohan Amarasingham, Henry Lam  

    Abstract:   
 Many \textit{event sequence} data exhibit mutually exciting or inhibiting patterns. Reliable detection of such temporal dependency is crucial for scientific investigation. The \textit{de facto} model is the Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP), whose impact function naturally encodes a causal structure in Granger causality. However, the vast majority of existing methods use direct or nonlinear transform of \textit{standard} MHP intensity with constant baseline, inconsistent with real-world data. Under irregular and unknown heterogeneous intensity, capturing temporal dependency is hard as one struggles to distinguish the effect of mutual interaction from that of intensity fluctuation. In this paper, we address the short-term temporal dependency detection issue. We show the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for cross-impact from MHP has an error that can not be eliminated but may be reduced by order of magnitude, using heterogeneous intensity not of the target HP but of the interacting HP. Then we proposed a robust and computationally-efficient method modified from MLE that does not rely on the prior estimation of the heterogeneous intensity and is thus applicable in a data-limited regime (e.g., few-shot, no repeated observations). Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones by notable margins, with highlighted novel applications in neuroscience. 
 ID: 583 | Content Sharing Design for Social Welfare in Networked Disclosure Game   
  
 Feiran Jia, Chenxi Qiu, Sarah Rajtmajer, Anna Squicciarini  

    Abstract:   
 This work models the costs and benefits of personal information sharing, or self-disclosure, in online social networks as a networked disclosure game. In a networked population where edges represent visibility amongst users, we assume a leader can influence network structure through content promotion, and we seek to optimize social welfare through network design. Our approach considers user interaction non-homogeneously, where pairwise engagement amongst users can involve or not involve sharing personal information. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. As a solution, we develop a Mixed-integer Linear Programming algorithm by linearization, which can achieve an exact solution, and also develop a time-efficient heuristic algorithm that can be used at scale. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the properties of the algorithms and map theoretical results to a dataset of posts and comments in 2020 and 2021 in a COVID-related Subreddit community where privacy risks and sharing tradeoffs were particularly pronounced.

 Sunrit Chakraborty, Aritra Guha, Rayleigh Lei, XuanLong Nguyen  

  TL;DR:  Proposed a Bayesian nonparametric model to extract interpretable patterns from complex spatio-temporal data and proposed a scalable inference algorithm to analyze large volume of data, which we demonstrate on the NGSIM traffic dataset.   Abstract:   
 Learning and understanding heterogeneous patterns in complex spatio-temporal data is an important and challenging task across domains in science and engineering. In this work we develop a model for learning heterogeneous and dynamic patterns of velocity field data, motivated by applications in the transportation domain. We draw from basic nonparametric Bayesian modeling elements such as infinite hidden Markov model and Gaussian process, and focus on making the learning of such a stochastic model scalable for voluminous and streaming data. This is achieved by employing sequential MAP estimates from the infinite HMM model, an efficient sequential sparse GP posterior computation and refinement of the estimates using Viterbi algorithm, which is shown to work effectively on a careful simulation study. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques to the NGSIM dataset of complex multi-vehicle interactions.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We propose a curriculum reinforcement learning approach, for long-horizon planning tasks, guided via reward machines that encode the non-Markovian reward function of the environment.   Abstract:   
 Self-paced reinforcement learning (RL) aims to improve the data efficiency of learning by automatically creating sequences, namely curricula, of probability distributions over contexts. However, existing techniques for self-paced RL fail in long-horizon planning tasks that involve temporally extended behaviors. We hypothesize that taking advantage of prior knowledge about the underlying task structure can improve the effectiveness of self-paced RL. We develop a self-paced RL algorithm guided by reward machines, i.e., a type of finite-state machine that encodes the underlying task structure. The algorithm integrates reward machines in 1) the update of the policy and value functions obtained by any RL algorithm of choice, and 2) the update of the automated curriculum that generates context distributions. Our empirical results evidence that the proposed algorithm achieves optimal behavior reliably even in cases in which existing baselines cannot make any meaningful progress. It also decreases the curriculum length and reduces the variance in the curriculum generation process by up to one-fourth and four orders of magnitude, respectively.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  This paper applies copulas to model unobserved dependencies between times of event and censorship in survival analysis, reducing bias in learned survival curves.   Abstract:   
 Survival datasets describe a set of instances (e.g., patients), and provide, for each, either the time until an event (e.g., death), or the censoring time (e.g., when lost to follow-up ‚Äì which is a lower bound on the time until the event). We consider the challenge of survival prediction: learning, from such data, a predictive model that can produce an individual survival distribution for a novel instance. Many contemporary methods of survival prediction implicitly assume that the event and censoring distributions are independent conditional on the instance‚Äôs covariates ‚Äì a strong assumption that is difficult to verify (as we observe only one outcome for each instance) and which can induce significant bias when it does not hold. This paper presents a parametric model of survival that extends modern non-linear survival analysis by relaxing the assumption of conditional independence. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate that our approach significantly improves estimates of survival distributions compared to the standard that assumes conditional independence in the data.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Crowdsourcing is an effective and efficient paradigm for obtaining labels for unlabeled corpus employing crowd workers. This work considers the budget allocation problem for a generalized setting on a graph of instances to be labeled where edges encode instance dependencies. Specifically, given a graph and a labeling budget, we propose an optimal policy to allocate the budget among the instances to maximize the overall labeling accuracy. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP), where we define our task as an optimization problem that maximizes the overall label accuracy under budget constraints. Then, we propose a novel stage-wise reward function that considers the effect of worker labels on the whole graph at each timestamp. This reward function is utilized to find an optimal policy for the optimization problem. Theoretically, we show that our proposed policies are consistent when the budget is infinite. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world graph datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policies to achieve a higher label accuracy under budget constraints. 
 ID: 594 | Risk-limiting Financial Audits via Weighted Sampling without Replacement   
  
 Shubhanshu Shekhar, Ziyu Xu, Zachary Chase Lipton, Pierre Jinghong Liang, Aaditya Ramdas  

  TL;DR:  A general approach to auditing financial transactions using confidence sequences for estimating weighted means under adaptive sampling without replacement.   Abstract:   
 We introduce the notion of a risk-limiting financial auditing (RLFA): given $N$ transactions, the goal is to estimate the total misstated monetary fraction ($m^*$) to a given accuracy $\epsilon$, with confidence $1-\delta$. We do this by constructing new confidence sequences (CSs) for the weighted average of $N$ unknown values, based on samples drawn without replacement according to a (randomized) weighted sampling scheme. Using the idea of importance weighting to construct test martingales, we first develop a framework to construct CSs for arbitrary sampling strategies. Next, we develop methods to improve the quality of CSs by incorporating side information about the unknown values associated with each item. We show that when the side information is sufficiently predictive, it can directly drive the sampling. Addressing the case where the accuracy is unknown *a priori*, we introduce a method that incorporates side information via control variates. Crucially, our construction is adaptive: if the side information is highly predictive of the unknown misstated amounts, then the benefits of incorporating it are significant; but if the side information is uncorrelated, our methods learn to ignore it. Our methods recover state-of-the-art bounds for the special case when the weights are equal, which has already found applications in election auditing. The harder weighted case solves our more challenging problem of AI-assisted financial auditing. 
 ID: 595 | No-Regret Linear Bandits beyond Realizability   
  
 Chong Liu, Ming Yin, Yu-Xiang Wang  

  TL;DR:  A no-regret algorithm solves linear bandit problem without realizability.   Abstract:   
 We study linear bandits when the underlying reward function is not linear. Existing work relies on a uniform misspecification parameter $\epsilon$ that measures the sup-norm error of the best linear approximation. This results in an unavoidable linear regret whenever $\epsilon > 0$. We describe a more natural model of misspecification which only requires the approximation error at each input $x$ to be proportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$. It captures the intuition that, for optimization problems, near-optimal regions should matter more and we can tolerate larger approximation errors in suboptimal regions. Quite surprisingly, we show that the classical LinUCB algorithm --- designed for the realizable case --- is automatically robust against such gap-adjusted misspecification. It achieves a near-optimal $\sqrt{T}$ regret for problems that the best-known regret is almost linear in time horizon $T$. Technically, our proof relies on a novel self-bounding argument that bounds the part of the regret due to misspecification by the regret itself.

 Vidya Sagar Sharma  

  TL;DR:  This paper gives a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to count the number of directed acyclic graphs in a Markov equivalence class under background knowledge constraint.   Abstract:   
 We study the problem of counting the number of directed acyclic graphs in a Markov equivalence class (MEC) that are consistent with background knowledge specified in the form of the directions of some additional edges in the MEC. A polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of the problem when no background knowledge constraints are specified was given by Wienöbst, Bannach, and Li≈õkiewicz (AAAI 2021), who also showed that the general case is NP-hard (in fact, #P-hard). In this paper, we show that the problem is nevertheless tractable in an interesting class of instances, by establishing that it is ``fixed-parameter tractable'': we give an algorithm that runs in time $O(k! k^2 n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the MEC and $k$ is the maximum number of nodes in any maximal clique of the MEC that participate in the specified background knowledge constraints. In particular, our algorithm run in polynomial time in the well-studied special case of MECs of bounded treewidth or bounded maximum clique size.

    [slides]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Significant progress has been made in developing identification and estimation techniques for missing data problems where modeling assumptions can be described via a directed acyclic graph. The validity of results using such techniques rely on the assumptions encoded by the graph holding true; however, verification of these assumptions has not received sufficient attention in prior work. In this paper, we provide new insights on the testable implications of three broad classes of missing data graphical models, and design goodness-of-fit tests for them. The classes of models explored are: sequential missing-at-random and missing-not-at-random models which can be used for modeling longitudinal studies with dropout/censoring, and a no self-censoring model which can be applied to cross-sectional studies and surveys. 
 ID: 598 | Conditionally Optimistic Exploration for Cooperative Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Xutong Zhao, Yangchen Pan, Chenjun Xiao, Sarath Chandar, Janarthanan Rajendran  

  TL;DR:  We introduce a conditional optimism-based exploration method for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.   Abstract:   
 Efficient exploration is critical in cooperative deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we propose an exploration method that efficiently encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of the theoretically justified tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees). The high-level intuition is that to perform optimism-based exploration, agents would achieve cooperative strategies if each agent's optimism estimate captures a structured dependency relationship with other agents. At each node (i.e., action) of the search tree, UCT performs optimism-based exploration using a bonus derived by conditioning on the visitation count of its parent node. We provide a perspective to view MARL as tree search iterations and develop a method called Conditionally Optimistic Exploration (COE). We assume agents take actions following a sequential order, and consider nodes at the same depth of the search tree as actions of one individual agent. COE computes each agent's state-action value estimate with an optimistic bonus derived from the visitation count of the state and joint actions taken by agents up to the current agent. COE is adaptable to any value decomposition method for centralized training with decentralized execution. Experiments across various cooperative MARL benchmarks show that COE outperforms current state-of-the-art exploration methods on hard-exploration tasks.

 Serena Lutong Wang, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Yichen Zhou, Sara Hooker, Michal Lukasik, Aditya Krishna Menon  

  TL;DR:  We explore the interplay between robust optimization objectives for the teacher and student in a knowledge distillation setting.   Abstract:   
 Knowledge distillation is a popular technique that has been shown to produce remarkable gains in average accuracy. However, recent work has shown that these gains are not uniform across subgroups in the data, and can often come at the cost of accuracy on rare subgroups and classes. Robust optimization is a common remedy to improve worst-class accuracy in standard learning settings, but in distillation it is unknown whether it is best to apply robust objectives when training the teacher, the student, or both. This work studies the interplay between robust objectives for the teacher and student. Empirically, we show that that jointly modifying the teacher and student objectives can lead to better worst-class student performance and even Pareto improvement in the tradeoff between worst-class and overall performance. Theoretically, we show that the *per-class calibration* of teacher scores is key when training a robust student. Both the theory and experiments support the surprising finding that applying a robust teacher training objective does not always yield a more robust student.

  TL;DR:  We revisit the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) in Euclidean and general $\ell_p^d$ spaces.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we revisit the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) in Euclidean and general $\ell_p^d$ spaces. Specifically, we focus on three settings that are still far from well understood: (1) DP-SCO over a constrained and bounded (convex) set in Euclidean space; (2) unconstrained DP-SCO in $\ell_p^d$ space; (3) DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data over a constrained and bounded set in $\ell_p^d$ space. For problem (1), for both convex and strongly convex loss functions, we propose methods whose outputs could achieve (expected) excess population risks that are only dependent on the Gaussian width of the constraint set, rather than the dimension of the space. Moreover, we also show the bound for strongly convex functions is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. For problems (2) and (3), we propose several novel algorithms and provide the first theoretical results for both cases when $1

 KISHALAY DAS, Pawan Goyal, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Niloy Ganguly  

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we propose a simple multi-modal framework for crystalline materials, which fuse both graph structural and textual representation together to improve property prediction accuracy.   Abstract:   
 Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate prediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e crystal graph structure, where they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture important global periodic structural information like space group number, crystal symmetry, rotational information etc, which influence different crystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials to model global structural information into graph structure to learn a more robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple multi- modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline materials. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe fusing textual representation with crystal graph structure provides consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own vanilla version. We are going to share the textual dataset, that we have curated for both the benchmark material databases with the community for future use. 
 ID: 606 | Graph Self-supervised Learning via Proximity Divergence Minimization   
  
 Tianyi Zhang, Zhenwei DAI, Zhaozhuo Xu, Anshumali Shrivastava  

    Abstract:   
 Self-supervised learning (SSL) for graphs is an essential problem since graph data are ubiquitous and labeling can be costly. We argue that existing SSL approaches for graphs have two limitations. First, they rely on corruption techniques such as node attribute perturbation and edge dropping to generate graph views for contrastive learning. These unnatural corruption techniques require extensive tuning efforts and provide marginal improvements. Second, the current approaches require the computation of multiple graph views, which is memory and computationally inefficient. These shortcomings of graph SSL call for a corruption-free single-view learning approach, but the strawman approach of using neighboring nodes as positive examples suffers two problems: it ignores the strength of connections between nodes implied by the graph structure on a macro level, and cannot deal with the high noise in real-world graphs. We propose Proximity Divergence Minimization (PDM), a corruption-free single-view graph SSL approach that overcomes these problems by leveraging node proximity to measure connection strength and denoise the graph structure. Through extensive experiments, we show that PDM achieves up to $4.55\%$ absolute improvement in ROC-AUC on graph SSL tasks over state-of-the-art approaches while being more memory efficient. Moreover, PDM even outperforms supervised training on node classification tasks of ogbn-proteins dataset. 
 ID: 607 | TCE: A Test-Based Approach to Measuring Calibration Error   
  
 Takuo Matsubara, Niek Tax, Richard Mudd, Ido Guy  

  TL;DR:  We propose a new calibration error metric that is interpretable and stable under class imbalance. In addition, we address an optimal criterion of binning in calibration.   Abstract:   
 This paper proposes a new metric to measure the calibration error of probabilistic binary classifiers, called the test-based calibration error (TCE). TCE incorporates a novel loss function based on a statistical test to examine the extent to which model predictions differ from probabilities estimated from data. It offers (i) a clear interpretation, (ii) a consistent scale that is unaffected by class imbalance, and (iii) an enhanced visual representation alternative to the standard reliability diagram. In addition, we introduce an optimality criterion for the binning procedure of calibration error metrics based on a minimal estimation error of the empirical probabilities. We provide a new computational algorithm for optimal bins under bin-size constraints. We demonstrate properties of TCE through a range of experiments, including multiple real-world imbalanced datasets and ImageNet 1000. 
 ID: 608 | Overcoming Language Priors for Visual Question Answering via Loss Rebalancing Label and Global Context   
  
 Runlin Cao, Zhixin Li  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel training strategy called Loss Rebalancing Label and Global Context (LRLGC) to mitigate language priors in visual question answering.   Abstract:   
 Despite the advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA), many VQA models currently suffer from language priors (i.e. generating answers directly from questions without using images), which severely reduces their robustness in real-world scenarios. We propose a novel training strategy called Loss Rebalancing Label and Global Context (LRLGC) to alleviate the above problem. Specifically, the Loss Rebalancing Label (LRL) is dynamically constructed based on the degree of sample bias to accurately adjust losses across samples and ensure a more balanced form of total losses in VQA. In addition, the Global Context (GC) provides the model with valid global information to assist the model in predicting answers more accurately. Finally, the model is trained through an ensemble-based approach that retains the beneficial effects of biased samples on the model while reducing their importance. Our approach is model-agnostic and enables end-to-end training. Extensive experimental results show that LRLGC (1) improves performance for various VQA models and (2) performs competitively in the VQA-CP v2 benchmark test. 
 ID: 611 | Bayesian Inference Approach for Entropy Regularized Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Dynamics   
 [spotlight]  
 Argenis Arriojas, Jacob Adamczyk, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V Kulkarni  

    Abstract:   
 We develop a novel approach to determine the optimal policy in entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) with stochastic dynamics. For deterministic dynamics, the optimal policy can be derived using Bayesian inference in the control-as-inference framework; however, for stochastic dynamics, the direct use of this approach leads to risk-taking optimistic policies. To address this issue, current approaches in entropy-regularized RL involve a constrained optimization procedure which fixes system dynamics to the original dynamics, however this approach is not consistent with the unconstrained Bayesian inference framework. In this work we resolve this inconsistency by developing an exact mapping from the constrained optimization problem in entropy-regularized RL to a different optimization problem which can be solved using the unconstrained Bayesian inference approach. We show that the optimal policies are the same for both problems, thus our results lead to the exact solution for the optimal policy in entropy-regularized RL with stochastic dynamics through Bayesian inference.

 Ilia Sucholutsky, Ruairidh McLennan Battleday, Katherine M. Collins, Raja Marjieh, Joshua Peterson, Pulkit Singh, Umang Bhatt, Nori Jacoby, Adrian Weller, Thomas L. Griffiths  

  TL;DR:  We propose a framework that enables comparison of supervision signals to help users optimize data annotation for supervised learning.   Abstract:   
 Supervised learning typically focuses on learning transferable representations from training examples annotated by humans. While rich annotations (like soft labels) carry more information than sparse annotations (like hard labels), they are also more expensive to collect. We use information theory to compare how a number of commonly used supervision signals contribute to representation-learning performance, as well as how their capacity is affected by factors such as the number of labels, classes, dimensions, and noise. Our framework provides theoretical justification for using hard labels in the big-data regime, but richer supervision signals for few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization. We validate these results empirically in a series of experiments with over 1 million crowdsourced image annotations and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to establish a tradeoff curve that enables users to optimize the cost of supervising representation learning on their own datasets.

  TL;DR:  We study the design of caching policies in applications such as serverless computing where there is not a fixed size cache to be filled , but rather there is a cost associated with the time an item stays in the cache.   Abstract:   
 We study the design of caching policies in applications such as serverless computing where there is not a fixed size cache to be filled, but rather there is a cost associated with the time an item stays in the cache. We present a model for such caching policies which captures the trade-off between this cost and the cost of cache misses. We characterize optimal caching policies in general and apply this characterization by deriving a closed form for Hawkes processes. Since optimal policies for Hawkes processes depend on the history of arrivals, we also develop history-independent policies which achieve near-optimal average performance. We evaluate the performances of the optimal policy and approximate polices using simulations and a data trace of Azure Functions, Microsoft's FaaS (Function as a Service) platform for serverless computing.

    [slides]   
   
  TL;DR:  We connect calibration in regression and classification with the notion of parity (whether the next observation increases or decreases w.r.t. the current observation), and propose methods to produce parity calibrated predictions.   Abstract:   
 In a sequential prediction setting, a decision-maker may be primarily concerned with whether the continuous-valued future observation will increase or decrease compared to the current one, rather than the actual value of the future observation. We introduce the parity calibration framework, where the goal is to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates for the increase-decrease event in a timeseries. While these ``parity" probabilities can be extracted from a distributional forecast, such a strategy does not work as expected and can have poor practical performance. We then observe that although the original task was regression, parity calibration can be expressed as binary calibration. Drawing on this connection, we use a recently proposed online binary calibration method to achieve parity calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real-world case studies in epidemiology, weather forecasting, and model-based control in nuclear fusion.

  TL;DR:  We propose a sampling mechanism for annotation queries to detect failure patterns from an unlabeled dataset   Abstract:   
 Given a (machine learning) classifier and a collection of unlabeled data, how can we efficiently identify misclassification patterns presented in this dataset? To address this problem, we propose a human-machine collaborative framework that consists of a team of human annotators and a sequential recommendation algorithm. The recommendation algorithm is conceptualized as a stochastic sampler that, in each round, queries the annotators a subset of samples for their true labels and obtains the information on whether the samples are misclassified. The sampling mechanism needs to balance between discovering new patterns of misclassification (exploration) and confirming the potential patterns of classification (exploitation). We construct a determinantal point process, whose intensity balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off through the weighted update of the posterior at each round to form the generator of the stochastic sampler. The numerical results empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our framework on multiple dataset at various signal-to-noise ratios.

  TL;DR:  Constrained learning for the problem of novel class detection under distribution shift; Guaranteed solution under relatively mild assumptions   Abstract:   
 In this work, we solve the problem of novel class detection under distribution shift. This problem is critical to ensuring the safety and efficacy of machine learning models, particularly in domains such as healthcare where timely detection of novel subgroups of patients is crucial. To address this problem, we propose a method based on constrained learning. Our approach is guaranteed to detect a novel class under a relatively weak assumption, namely that rare events in past data have bounded frequency under the shifted distribution. Prior works on the problem do not provide such guarantees, as they either attend to very specific types of distribution shift or make stringent assumptions that limit their guarantees. We demonstrate favorable performance of our method on challenging novel class detection problems over real world datasets.

 Noah Burrell, Grant Schoenebeck  

  TL;DR:  We explore the extent to which common assumptions about the way that crowd workers make mistakes in microtask (labeling) applications manifest in real crowdsourcing data.   Abstract:   
 Do common assumptions about the way that crowd workers make mistakes in microtask (labeling) applications manifest in real crowdsourcing data? Prior work only addresses this question indirectly. Instead, it primarily focuses on designing new label aggregation algorithms, seeming to imply that better performance justifies any additional assumptions. However, empirical evidence in past instances has raised significant challenges to common assumptions. We continue this line of work, using crowdsourcing data itself as directly as possible to interrogate several basic assumptions about workers and tasks. We find strong evidence that the assumption that workers respond correctly to each task with a constant probability, which is common in theoretical work, is implausible in real data. We also illustrate how heterogeneity among tasks and workers can take different forms, which have different implications for the design and evaluation of label aggregation algorithms.

  TL;DR:  Our work uses probabilistic deep networks with statistical image models to learn informative priors for structured images allowing active learning for dense regression tasks, like super-resolution.   Abstract:   
 Dense regression is a widely used approach in computer vision for tasks such as image super-resolution, enhancement, depth estimation, etc. However, the high cost of annotation and labeling makes it challenging to achieve accurate results. We propose incorporating active learning into dense regression models to address this problem. Active learning allows models to select the most informative samples for labeling, reducing the overall annotation cost while improving performance. Despite its potential, active learning has not been widely explored in high-dimensional computer vision regression tasks like super-resolution. We address this research gap and propose a new framework called USIM-DAL that leverages the statistical properties of colour images to learn informative priors using probabilistic deep neural networks that model the heteroscedastic predictive distribution allowing uncertainty quantification. Moreover, the aleatoric uncertainty from the network serves as a proxy for error that is used for active learning. Our experiments on a wide variety of datasets spanning applications in natural images (visual genome, BSD100), medical imaging (histopathology slides), and remote sensing (satellite images) demonstrate the efficacy of the newly proposed USIM-DAL and superiority over several dense regression active learning methods.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 We investigate the problems of maximizing $k$-submodular functions over total size constraints and over individual size constraints. $k$-submodularity is a generalization of submodularity beyond just picking items of a ground set, instead associating one of $k$ types to chosen items. For sensor selection problems, for instance, this enables modeling of which type of sensor to put at a location, not simply whether to put a sensor or not. We propose and analyze threshold-greedy algorithms for both types of constraints. We prove that our proposed algorithms achieve the best known approximation ratios, up to a user-chosen parameter $\varepsilon>0$, for both constraint types while using only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(nk)$ function evaluations; other algorithms that achieve the best-known deterministic approximation ratios use $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(nkB)$ function evaluations, where $B\leq n$ is the total cardinality and sum of cardinalities respectively, $n$ is the number of elements, and $k$ is the number of types, and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ suppresses logarithmic terms. We empirically demonstrate our algorithms' performance in an application of influence maximization with $k$ topics.

 Gathika Ratnayaka, Qing Wang, Yang Li  

  TL;DR:  This paper introduces a contrastive learning framework for deep graph matching.   Abstract:   
 Deep graph matching techniques have shown promising results in recent years. In this work, we cast deep graph matching as a contrastive learning task and introduce a new objective function for contrastive mapping to exploit the relationships between matches and non-matches. To this end, we develop a hardness attention mechanism to select negative samples which captures the relatedness and informativeness of positive and negative samples. Further, we propose a novel deep graph matching framework, \emph{Stable Graph Matching} (StableGM), which incorporates Sinkhorn ranking into a stable marriage algorithm to efficiently compute one-to-one node correspondences between graphs. We prove that the proposed objective function for contrastive matching is both positive and negative informative, offering theoretical guarantees to achieve dual-optimality in graph matching. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by conducting experiments on standard graph matching benchmarks.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  On the problem of recovering causal DAGs via interventions, we study the trade-off between the number of adaptive rounds used and the number of interventions required; we give matching upper and lower bounds.   Abstract:   
 Causal discovery from interventional data is an important problem, where the task is to design an interventional strategy that learns the hidden ground truth causal graph $G(V,E)$ on $|V| = n$ nodes while minimizing the number of performed interventions. Most prior interventional strategies broadly fall into two categories: non-adaptive and adaptive. Non-adaptive strategies decide on a single fixed set of interventions to be performed while adaptive strategies can decide on which nodes to intervene on sequentially based on past interventions. While adaptive algorithms may use exponentially fewer interventions than their non-adaptive counterparts, there are practical concerns that constrain the amount of adaptivity allowed. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the problem of $r$-adaptivity, where the algorithm designer recovers the causal graph under a total of $r$ sequential rounds whilst trying to minimize the total number of interventions. For this problem, we provide a $r$-adaptive algorithm that achieves $O(\min\{r,\log n\} \cdot n^{1/\min\{r,\log n\}})$ approximation with respect to the verification number, a well-known lower bound for adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, for every $r$, we show that our approximation is tight. Our definition of $r$-adaptivity interpolates nicely between the non-adaptive ($r=1$) and fully adaptive ($r=n$) settings where our approximation simplifies to $O(n)$ and $O(\log n)$ respectively, matching the best-known approximation guarantees for both extremes. Our results also extend naturally to the bounded size interventions.

 [spotlight]  
 Abhimanyu Das, Weihao Kong, Biswajit Paria, Rajat Sen  

  TL;DR:  Top down inspired end to end method for hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasting   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic, hierarchically coherent forecasting is a key problem in many practical forecasting applications -- the goal is to obtain coherent probabilistic predictions for a large number of time series arranged in a pre-specified tree hierarchy. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep probabilistic model for hierarchical forecasting that is motivated by a classical top-down strategy. It jointly learns the distribution of the root time series, and the (dirichlet) proportions according to which each parent time-series is split among its children at any point in time. The resulting forecasts are naturally coherent, and provide probabilistic predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We experiment on several public datasets and demonstrate significant improvements of up to 26% on most datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we also provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to the more traditional bottom-up modeling.

  TL;DR:  We are proposing a method (FLASH), which solves the CASH problem for an FL setting in a decentralized way and do not need any FL training in the solution of CASH   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we present FLASH, a framework which addresses for the first time the central AutoML problem of Combined Algorithm Selection and HyperParameter (HP) Optimization (CASH) in the context of Federated Learning (FL). To limit training cost, FLASH incrementally adapts the set of algorithms to train based on their projected loss rates, while supporting decentralized (federated) implementation of the embedded hyperparameter optimization (HPO), model selection and loss calculation problems. We provide a theoretical analysis of the training and validation loss under FLASH, and their tradeoff with the training cost measured as the data wasted in training sub-optimal algorithms. The bounds depend on the degree of dissimilarity between the datasets of the clients, a result of FL restriction that client datasets remain private. Through extensive experimental investigation on several datasets, we evaluate three variants of FLASH, and show that FLASH performs close to centralized CASH methods.

 [spotlight]  
 Vignesh Ram Somnath, Matteo Pariset, Ya-Ping Hsieh, Maria Rodriguez Martinez, Andreas Krause, Charlotte Bunne  

    Abstract:   
 Diffusion Schrödinger Bridges (DSBs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for recovering stochastic dynamics via their marginal observations at different time points. Despite numerous successful applications, existing algorithms for solving DSBs have so far failed to utilize the structure of aligned data, which naturally arises in many biological phenomena. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework that, for the first time, solves DSBs while respecting the data alignment. Our approach hinges on a combination of two decades-old ideas: The classical Schrödinger bridge theory and Doob's $h$-transform. Compared to prior methods, our approach leads to a simpler training procedure with lower variance, which we further augment with principled regularization schemes. This ultimately leads to sizeable improvements across experiments on synthetic and real data, including the tasks of rigid protein docking and temporal evolution of cellular differentiation processes.

 Deqian Kong, Bo Pang, Tian Han, Ying Nian Wu  

  TL;DR:  We propose to use latent space energy-based model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties and optimize molecule properties by sampling with gradual distribution shifting.   Abstract:   
 Generation of molecules with desired chemical and biological properties such as high drug-likeness, high binding affinity to target proteins, is critical for drug discovery. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties. Our model assumes an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space. Conditional on the latent vector, the molecule and its properties are modeled by a molecule generation model and a property regression model respectively. To search for molecules with desired properties, we propose a sampling with gradual distribution shifting (SGDS) algorithm, so that after learning the model initially on the training data of existing molecules and their properties, the proposed algorithm gradually shifts the model distribution towards the region supported by molecules with desired values of properties. Our experiments show that our method achieves competitive performances on various molecule design tasks.

 Ziyu Wang, Binjie Yuan, Jiaxun Lu, Bowen Ding, yunfeng shao, Qibin Wu, Jun Zhu  

    Abstract:   
 Consider the problem of out-of-distribution prediction given data from multiple environments. While a sufficiently diverse collection of training environments will facilitate the identification of an invariant predictor, with an optimal generalization performance, many applications only provide us with a limited number of environments. It is thus necessary to consider adapting to distribution shift using a handful of labeled test samples. We propose a constrained Bayesian approach for this task, which restricts to models with a worst-group training loss above a prespecified threshold. Our method avoids a pathology of the standard Bayesian posterior, which occurs when spurious correlations improve in-distribution prediction. We also show that on certain high-dimensional linear problems, constrained modeling improves the sample efficiency of adaptation. Synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the robust performance of our approach.

    Abstract:   
 Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and Nesterov's Accelerated Stochastic Gradient (ASG) are popular momentum methods in optimization. While the benefits of these acceleration ideas in deterministic settings are well understood, their advantages in stochastic optimization are unclear. Several works have recently claimed that SHB and ASG always help in stochastic optimization. Our work shows that i.) these claims are either flawed or one-sided (e.g., consider only the bias term but not the variance), and ii.) when both these terms are accounted for, SHB and ASG do not always help. Specifically, for \textit{any} quadratic optimization, we obtain a lower bound on the sample complexity of SHB and ASG, accounting for both bias and variance, and show that the vanilla SGD can achieve the same bound.

  TL;DR:  This paper shows that bidirectional attention is equivalent to continuous bag of words with mixture-of-experts weights, and builds on this equivalence to argue about linear structures on the embeddings and give extensions to sequence and tabular data   Abstract:   
 Bidirectional attention has emerged as a key component of modern large language models, which includes self-attention mechanism, position encodings, and the MLM objective. Despite its widespread use, few studies have examined the inductive bias underlying bidirectional attention: What sets bidirectional attention models apart from its non-attention predecessors like CBOW? Are they completely different model classes? In this paper, we show that, upon reparameterization, bidirectional attention---namely training single-head single-layer attention with position encodings using the MLM objective---is equivalent to CBOW with mixture-of-experts weights, hence bidirectional attention as mixture of continuous word experts. This viewpoint enables us to characterize when embeddings from bidirectional attention exhibit a similar linear structure to its non-attention predecessors (e.g., word2vec, GloVe). It also suggests immediate extensions of bidirectional attention beyond text, including general non-textual sequence data and tabular data. Empirically, we demonstrate the attention-based approach to tabular data improves out-of-distribution generalization.

 Petra Berenbrink, Max Hahn-Klimroth, Dominik Kaaser, Lena Krieg, Malin Rau  

    Abstract:   
 We consider the so-called \emph{Independent Cascade Model} for rumor spreading or epidemic processes popularized by Kempe et al.\ (2003). In this model, a node of a network is the source of a rumor -- it is \emph{informed}. In discrete time steps, each informed node ``infects'' each of its uninformed neighbors with probability $p$. While many facets of this process are studied in the literature, less is known about the inference problem: given a number of infected nodes in a network, can we learn the source of the rumor? In the context of epidemiology this problem is often referred to as \emph{patient zero problem}. It belongs to a broader class of problems where the goal is to infer parameters of the underlying spreading model. In this work we present a maximum likelihood estimator for the rumor's source, given a snapshot of the process in terms of a set of active nodes $X$ after $t$ steps. Our results show that, for acyclic graphs, the likelihood estimator undergoes a phase transition as a function of $t$. We provide a rigorous analysis for two prominent classes of acyclic network, namely $d$-regular trees and Galton-Watson trees, and verify empirically that our heuristics work well in various general networks.

    Abstract:   
 We propose policy gradient algorithms for solving a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning problem in on-policy as well as off-policy settings. We consider episodic Markov decision processes and model the risk using the broad class of smooth risk measures of the cumulative discounted reward. We propose two template policy gradient algorithms that optimize a smooth risk measure in on-policy and off-policy RL settings, respectively. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that quantify the rate of convergence to our proposed algorithms to a stationary point of the smooth risk measure. As special cases, we establish that our algorithms apply to the optimization of mean-variance and distortion risk measures, respectively.

 Swagatam Haldar, Diptikalyan Saha, Dennis Wei, Rahul Nair, Elizabeth M. Daly  

  TL;DR:  We provide a framework to understand the similarities and differences between two models trained for the same task in an interpretable fashion.   Abstract:   
 Understanding the differences between machine learning (ML) models is of interest in scenarios ranging from choosing amongst a set of competing models, to updating a deployed model with new training data. In these cases, we wish to go beyond differences in overall metrics such as accuracy to identify where in the feature space do the differences occur. We formalize this problem of model differencing as one of predicting a dissimilarity function of two ML models‚Äô outputs, subject to the representation of the differences being human-interpretable. Our solution is to learn a Joint Surrogate Tree (JST), which is composed of two conjoined decision tree surrogates for the two models. A JST provides an intuitive representation of differences and places the changes in the context of the models‚Äô decision logic. Context is important as it helps users to map differences to an underlying mental model of an AI system. We also propose a refinement procedure to increase the precision of a JST. We demonstrate, through an empirical evaluation, that such contextual differencing is concise and can be achieved with no loss in fidelity over naive approaches.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Off-policy methods are the basis of a large number of effective Policy Optimization (PO) algorithms. In this setting, Importance Sampling (IS) is typically employed as a what-if analysis tool, with the goal of estimating the performance of a target policy, given samples collected with a different behavioral policy. However, in Monte Carlo simulation, IS represents a variance minimization approach. In this field, a suitable behavioral distribution is employed for sampling, allowing diminishing the variance of the estimator below the one achievable when sampling from the target distribution. In this paper, we analyze IS in these two guises in the context of PO. We provide a novel view of off-policy PO, showing a connection between the policy improvement and variance minimization objectives. Then, we illustrate how minimizing the off-policy variance can, in some circumstances, lead to a policy improvement, with the advantage, compared with direct off-policy learning, of implicitly enforcing a trust region. Finally, we present numerical simulations on continuous RL benchmarks, with a particular focus on the robustness to small batch sizes. 
 ID: 695 | On the Role of Generalization in Transferability of Adversarial Examples   
  
 Yilin Wang, Farzan Farnia  

    Abstract:   
 Black-box adversarial attacks designing adversarial examples for unseen deep neural networks (DNNs) have received great attention over the past years. However, the underlying factors driving the transferability of black-box adversarial examples still lack a thorough understanding. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the role of the generalization behavior of the substitute classifier used for generating adversarial examples in the transferability of the attack scheme to unobserved DNN classifiers. To do this, we apply the max-min adversarial example game framework and show the importance of the generalization properties of the substitute DNN from training to test data in the success of the black-box attack scheme in application to different DNN classifiers. We prove theoretical generalization bounds on the difference between the attack transferability rates on training and test samples. Our bounds suggest that operator norm-based regularization methods could improve the transferability of the designed adversarial examples. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments showing the role of the substitute network's generalization in generating transferable adversarial examples. Our empirical results indicate the power of Lipschitz regularization and early stopping methods in improving the transferability of designed adversarial examples. 
 ID: 696 | Greed is good: correspondence recovery for unlabeled linear regression   
  
 Hang Zhang, Ping Li  

    Abstract:   
 We consider the unlabeled linear regression reading as $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{*}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{B}^* + \mathbf{W}$, where $\mathbf{\Pi}^{*}, \mathbf{B}^*$ and $\mathbf{W}$ represents missing (or incomplete) correspondence information, signals, and additive noise, respectively. Our goal is to perform data alignment between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$, or equivalently, reconstruct the correspondence information encoded by $\mathbf{\Pi}^*$. Based on whether signal $\mathbf{B}^*$ is given a prior, we separately propose two greedy-selection based estimators, which both reach the mini-max optimality. Compared with previous works, our work $(i)$ supports partial recovery of the correspondence information; and $(ii)$ applies to a general matrix family rather than the permutation matrices, to put more specifically, selection matrices, where multiple rows of $\mathbf{X}$ can correspond to the same row in $\mathbf{Y}$. Moreover, numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our claims.

However, most such abstractions need to be designed and refined by hand for different problems and domains of application. This paper presents a novel top-down approach for constructing state abstractions while carrying out reinforcement learning (RL). Starting with state variables and a simulator, it presents a novel domain-independent approach for dynamically computing an abstraction based on the dispersion of Q-values in abstract states as the agent continues acting and learning. Extensive empirical evaluation on multiple domains and problems shows that this approach automatically learns abstractions that are finely-tuned to the problem, yield powerful sample efficiency, and result in the RL agent significantly outperforming existing approaches. 
 ID: 704 | Time-Conditioned Generative Modeling of Object-Centric Representations for Video Decomposition and Prediction   
  
 Chengmin Gao, Bin Li  

    Abstract:   
 When perceiving the world from multiple viewpoints, humans have the ability to reason about the complete objects in a compositional manner even when the object is completely occluded from partial viewpoints. Meanwhile, humans can imagine the novel views after observing multiple viewpoints. The remarkable recent advance in multiview object-centric learning leaves some problems: 1) the partially or completely occluded shape of objects can not be well reconstructed. 2) the novel viewpoint prediction depends on expensive viewpoint annotations rather than implicit view rules. This makes the agent fail to perform like humans. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative model for videos. To reconstruct the complete shape of the object accurately, we enhance the disentanglement between different latent representations: view latent representations are jointly inferred based on the Transformer and then cooperate with the sequential extension of Slot Attention to learn object-centric representations. The model also achieves the new ability: Gaussian processes are employed as priors of view latent variables for generation and novel-view prediction without viewpoint annotations. Experiments on multiple specifically designed synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed model can 1) make the video decomposition, 2) reconstruct the complete shapes of objects, and 3) make the novel viewpoint prediction without viewpoint annotations. 
 ID: 707 | Phase-shifted Adversarial Training   
 [spotlight]  
 Yeachan Kim, Seongyeon Kim, Ihyeok Seo, Bonggun Shin  

  TL;DR:  we present a novel approach to adversarial training, coined phase-shifted adversarial training, to learn the adversarial examples in an efficient manner.   Abstract:   
 While adversarial training (AT) has been considered an imperative component for safely deploying neural network-based applications, it comes with slow convergence and worse performance on clean samples. In this work, we analyze the behavior of neural networks when learning with adversarial samples through the lens of response frequency. Interestingly, we empirically observe that AT causes neural networks to have slow convergence to high-frequency information, resulting in highly oscillated predictions near each data. To learn high-frequency contents efficiently, we first prove that a universal phenomenon of frequency principle, i.e., \textit{lower frequencies are learned first}, still holds in AT. Built upon such theoretical ground, we present a novel approach to adversarial training, coined phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT). In PhaseAT, the high-frequency components, which are susceptible factor for slow convergence, are adaptively shifted into the low-frequency range where the fast convergence occurs. For evaluations, we conduct the extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with the adaptive attack carefully designed for reliable evaluation. Comprehensive results show that PhaseAT substantially improves the convergence for high-frequency information, thereby leading to the improved adversarial robustness in an efficient manner with better accuracy on clean samples. 
 ID: 713 | Regularized Online DR-Submodular Optimization   
  
 Pengyu Zuo, Yao Wang, Shaojie Tang  

  TL;DR:  This paper proposes a regularized online optimization problem with concave and DR-submodular regularizers, and presents efficient algorithms for both cases with theoretical performance guarantees.   Abstract:   
 The utilization of online optimization techniques is prevalent in many fields of artificial intelligence, enabling systems to continuously learn and adjust to their surroundings. This paper outlines a regularized online optimization problem, where the regularizer is defined on the average of the actions taken. The objective is to maximize the sum of rewards and the regularizer value while adhering to resource constraints, where the reward function is assumed to be DR-submodular. Both concave and DR-submodular regularizers are analyzed. Concave functions are useful in describing the impartiality of decisions, while DR-submodular functions can be employed to represent the overall effect of decisions on all relevant parties. We have developed two algorithms for each of the concave and DR-submodular regularizers. These algorithms are easy to implement, efficient, and produce sublinear regret in both cases. The performance of the proposed algorithms and regularizers has been verified through numerical experiments in the context of internet advertising. 
 ID: 722 | Mitigating Transformer Overconfidence via Lipschitz Regularization   
  
 Wenqian Ye, Yunsheng Ma, Xu Cao, Kun Tang  

    Abstract:   
 Though Transformers have achieved promising results in many computer vision tasks, they tend to be over-confident in predictions, as the standard Dot Product Self-Attention (DPSA) can barely preserve distance for the unbounded input domain. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a novel Lipschitz Regularized Transformer (LRFormer). Specifically, we present a new similarity function with the distance within Banach Space to ensure the Lipschitzness and also regularize the term by a contractive Lipschitz Bound. The proposed method is analyzed with a theoretical guarantee, providing a rigorous basis for its effectiveness and reliability. Extensive experiments conducted on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art single forward pass approaches in prediction, calibration, and uncertainty estimation.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We propose a risk-aware curriculum generation algorithm that, given a heavy-tailed distribution over target tasks, generates two curricula: one to maximize the expected discounted return, and another to identify and over-sample rare and risky tasks.   Abstract:   
 Automated curriculum generation facilitates reinforcement learning (RL) by designing a sequence of tasks. It typically aims to optimize a distribution over tasks with exponentially bounded tails. In this setting, the agent might be underexposed to rare tasks, leading to a sub-optimal behavior. This issue is exacerbated in task distributions with heavy tails. To mitigate this issue, we propose a risk-aware curriculum generation algorithm that mixes two curricula: 1) a primary curriculum that aims to maximize the expected discounted return with respect to a distribution over target tasks, and 2) an auxiliary curriculum that identifies and over-samples rare tasks observed in the primary curriculum. Our empirical results in two domains with heavy-tailed distributions evidence that the proposed algorithm achieves higher returns in frequent as well as rare tasks compared to the state-of-the-art curriculum generation methods. 
 ID: 732 | Practical Privacy-Preserving Gaussian Process Regression via Secret Sharing   
  
 Jinglong Luo, Yehong Zhang, Jiaqi Zhang, Shuang Qin, Yue Yu, Hui Wang, Zenglin Xu  

  TL;DR:  This is the first work that considers to protect the privacy of a Gaussian process regression model via secret sharing.   Abstract:   
 Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a non-parametric model that has been used in many real-world applications that involve sensitive personal data (e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.) from multiple data owners. To fully and securely exploit the value of different data sources, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving GPR method based on secret sharing (SS), a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technique. In contrast to existing studies that protect the data privacy of GPR via homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or federated learning, our proposed method is more practical and can be used to preserve the data privacy of both the model inputs and outputs for various data-sharing scenarios (e.g., horizontally/vertically-partitioned data). However, it is non-trivial to directly apply SS on the conventional GPR algorithm, as it includes some operations whose accuracy and/or efficiency have not been well-enhanced in the current SMPC protocol. To address this issue, we derive a new SS-based exponentiation operation through the idea of ‚Äúconfusion-correction‚Äù and constructing a privacy-preserving matrix inversion algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition. More importantly, we theoretically analyze the communication cost and the security of the proposed SS-based operations. Empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that our proposed method can achieve reasonable accuracy and efficiency under the premise of preserving data privacy. 
 ID: 741 | BeaU-PPG: Uncertainty-aware Heart Rate Estimation from PPG signals via Belief Propagation   
  
 Valentin Bieri, Paul Streli, Berken Utku Demirel, Christian Holz  

  TL;DR:  A Belief Propagation method for PPG-based heart rate estimation.   Abstract:   
 We present a novel learning-based method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several heart rate estimation benchmarks extracted from photoplethysmography signals (PPG). We consider the evolution of the heart rate in the context of a discrete-time stochastic process that we represent as a hidden Markov model. We derive a distribution over possible heart rate values for a given PPG signal window through a trained neural network. Using belief propagation, we incorporate the statistical distribution of heart rate changes to refine these estimates in a temporal context. From this, we obtain a quantized probability distribution over the range of possible heart rate values that captures a meaningful and well-calibrated estimate of the inherent predictive uncertainty. We show the robustness of our method on eight public datasets with three-different cross-validation experiments. 
 ID: 747 | A Decoder Suffices for Query-Adaptive Variational Inference   
 [spotlight]  
 Sakshi Agarwal, Gabriel Hope, Ali Younis, Erik B. Sudderth  
   
    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Deep generative models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely used for density estimation and dimensionality reduction, but infer latent representations via amortized inference algorithms that require observations of all data dimensions. VAEs thus lack a key strength of probabilistic graphical models: the ability to infer posteriors for test queries with arbitrary structure. We demonstrate that many prior methods for imputation with VAEs are costly and ineffective, and achieve superior performance via query-adaptive variational inference (QAVI) algorithms based directly on the generative decoder. By analytically marginalizing arbitrary sets of missing features, and optimizing expressive posteriors including mixtures and density flows, our non-amortized QAVI algorithms achieve excellent performance while avoiding expensive model retraining. On standard image and tabular datasets, our approach substantially outperforms prior methods in the plausibility and diversity of imputations. We also show that QAVI effectively generalizes to recent hierarchical VAE models for high-dimensional images. 
 ID: 748 | Incentivizing honest performative predictions with proper scoring rules   
  
 Caspar Oesterheld, Johannes Treutlein, Emery Cooper, Rubi Hudson  

  TL;DR:  Oracle AI, proper scoring rules, self-fulfilling prophecy, performative prediction, AI safety   Abstract:   
 Proper scoring rules incentivize experts to accurately report beliefs, assuming predictions cannot influence outcomes. We relax this assumption and investigate incentives when predictions are performative, i.e., when they can influence the outcome of the prediction, such as when making public predictions about the stock market. We say a prediction is a fixed point if it accurately reflects the expert‚Äôs beliefs after that prediction has been made. We show that in this setting, reports maximizing expected score generally do not reflect an expert‚Äôs beliefs, and we give bounds on the inaccuracy of such reports. We show that, for binary predictions, if the influence of the expert‚Äôs prediction on outcomes is bounded, it is possible to define scoring rules under which optimal reports are arbitrarily close to fixed points. However, this is impossible for predictions over more than two outcomes. We also perform numerical simulations in a toy setting, showing that our bounds are tight in some situations and that prediction error is often substantial (greater than 5-10%). Lastly, we discuss alternative notions of optimality, including performative stability, and show that they incentivize reporting fixed points. 
 ID: 750 | Universal Graph Contrastive Learning with a Novel Laplacian Perturbation   
  
 Taewook Ko, Yoonhyuk Choi, Chong-Kwon Kim  

  TL;DR:  We introcued a novel universal graph contrastive learning by defining a Laplacian peturbation.   Abstract:   
 Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is an effective method for discovering meaningful patterns in graph data. By evaluating diverse augmentations of the graph, GCL learns discriminative representations and provides a flexible and scalable mechanism for various graph mining tasks. This paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework based on Laplacian perturbation. The framework employs a complex Hermitian adjacency matrix which enables the application of a novel graph Laplacian. Unlike existing GCL methods, the proposed framework is not restricted to specific graph types and enjoys a wider range of applicability. We demonstrate that a spectral graph convolution based on the Laplacian extracts the representations of diverse graph types successfully. Our extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets, covering multiple graph types, show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both node classification and link sign prediction tasks. 
 ID: 753 | Do we become wiser with time? On causal equivalence with tiered background knowledge.   
  
 Christine W. Bang, Vanessa Didelez  
   
    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We show formally why and when incorporating tiered background knowledge into equivalence classes of DAGs leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency.   Abstract:   
 Equivalence classes of DAGs (represented by CPDAGs) may be too large to provide useful causal information. Here, we address incorporating tiered background knowledge yielding restricted equivalence classes represented by ‚Äòtiered MPDAGs‚Äô. Tiered knowledge leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency: We show that construction of tiered MPDAGs only requires application of Meeks 1st rule, and that tiered MPDAGs (unlike general MPDAGs) are chain graphs with chordal components. This entails simplifications e.g. of determining valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Further, we characterise when one tiered ordering is more informative than another, providing insights into useful aspects of background knowledge. 
 ID: 756 | Structure-aware robustness certificates for graph classification   
  
 Pierre Osselin, Henry Kenlay, Xiaowen Dong  

  TL;DR:  Randomized smooothing with anisotropic noise is introduced in the context of graph classification leading to more flexible robustness certificates.   Abstract:   
 Certifying the robustness of a graph-based machine learning model poses a critical challenge for safety. Current robustness certificates for graph classifiers guarantee output invariance with respect to the total number of node pair flips (edge addition or edge deletion), which amounts to an $l_{0}$ ball centred on the adjacency matrix. Although theoretically attractive, this type of isotropic structural noise can be too restrictive in practical scenarios where some node pairs are more critical than others in determining the classifier's output. The certificate, in this case, gives a pessimistic depiction of the robustness of the graph model. To tackle this issue, we develop a randomised smoothing method based on adding an anisotropic noise distribution to the input graph structure. We show that our process generates structural-aware certificates for our classifiers, whereby the magnitude of robustness certificates can vary across different pre-defined structures of the graph. We demonstrate the benefits of these certificates in both synthetic and real-world experiments. 
 ID: 757 | Scaling Integer Arithmetic in Probabilistic Programs   
  
 William Cao, Poorva Garg, Ryan Tjoa, Steven Holtzen, Todd Millstein, Guy Van den Broeck  

  TL;DR:  A binary encoding combined with knowledge compilation allows for scaled inference on integer distributions.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) allow a program to define a probabilistic model. Within the framework of a programming language, they provide the ability to declare random variables and condition on complex events. Much like traditional programming languages, where integers are perhaps the most common data type, one natural feature of PPLs is their ability to manipulate distributions over integers. Although most PPLs provide the ability to express distributions over integers, their support for inference over these distributions is limited. Most approaches essentially reduce to enumeration of all possible values, a strategy that does not scale well, or to general-purpose sampling. Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these approaches are not using. We present a binary encoding strategy for random integers where binary-number bits are replaced by Boolean functions of random coin flips. This binary encoding then enables the circuit compilation approach to probabilistic inference to naturally exploit the structure behind arithmetic operations. This inference strategy scales to much larger integer distributions with arithmetic, further allowing us to support more language constructs such as parametrised flips and Beta priors, which enables Bayesian parameter learning from incomplete data.

  TL;DR:  This work presents several improvements upon existing computational protein re-design algorithm, AOBB-K*, noticeably improving scalability and leading to schemes that can be generalized to other well known tasks over graphical models.   Abstract:   
 Scientific computing has experienced a boom empowered by advancements in technologies such as neural networks. However, certain important tasks are less amenable to these technologies, benefiting from innovations to traditional inference schemes. One such task is protein re-design. Recently a new re-design algorithm, AOBB-K*, was introduced and was competitive with state-of-the art BBK* on small protein re-design problems that assume rigid backbone and rotamers. However, AOBB-K* suffered scalability issues. In this work, we address issues that limited AOBB-K* and present three new variants: AOBB-K*-b (boosted), AOBB-K*-DH (with dynamic heuristics), and AOBB-K*-UFO (with underflow optimization) that noticeably improve scalability. From their founding principles, we also present generalized schemes useful for other well known inference tasks. 
 ID: 764 | Robust Gaussian Process Regression with the Trimmed Marginal Likelihood   
 [spotlight]  
 Daniel Andrade, Akiko Takeda  

  TL;DR:  Optimizing the marginal likelihood for outlier detection with an efficient projected gradient descent method.   Abstract:   
 Accurate outlier detection is not only a necessary preprocessing step, but can itself give important insights into the data. However, especially, for non-linear regression the detection of outliers is non-trivial, and actually ambiguous. We propose a new method that identifies outliers by finding a subset of data points $T$ such that the marginal likelihood of all remaining data points $S$ is maximized. Though the idea is more general, it is particular appealing for Gaussian processes regression, where the marginal likelihood has an analytic solution. While maximizing the marginal likelihood for hyper-parameter optimization is a well established non-convex optimization problem, optimizing the set of data points $S$ is not. Indeed, even a greedy approximation for optimizing the set of data points $S$ is computationally challenging due to the high cost of evaluating the marginal likelihood. As a remedy, we propose an efficient projected gradient descent method with provable convergence guarantees. Moreover, we also establish the breakdown point when jointly optimizing hyper-parameters and $S$. For various datasets and types of outliers, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve outlier detection and robustness when compared with several popular alternatives, like the student-t likelihood. 
 ID: 773 | Finding Invariant Predictors Efficiently via Causal Structure   
  
 Kenneth Lee, Md Musfiqur Rahman, Murat Kocaoglu  

  TL;DR:  We develop a sound algorithm for finding invariant predictors that runs in polynomial time and yields predictive performance that is comparable to the existing work.   Abstract:   
 One fundamental problem in machine learning is out-of-distribution generalization. A method named the surgery estimator incorporates the causal structure in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to find predictors that are invariant across target domains using distributional invariances via Pearl‚Äôs do-calculus. However, finding a surgery estimator can take exponential time as the current methods need to search through all possible predictors. In this work, we first provide a graphical characterization of the identifiability of conditional causal queries. Next, we leverage this characterization together with a greedy search step to develop a polynomial-time algorithm for finding invariant predictors using the causal graph. Given the correct causal graph, our method is guaranteed to find at least one invariant predictor, if it exists. We show that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the run-time both in simulated and semi-synthetic data experiments and have predictive performance that is comparable to the existing work that runs in exponential time. 
 ID: 775 | Exploiting Long-Range Influences in Learning Generalized Neural Policies for RDDL Relational MDPs   
  
 Vishal Sharma, Daman Arora, Mausam ., Parag Singla  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel method for handling long range dependencies in neural policies for RDDL RMDPs   Abstract:   
 We focus on the learning of generalized neural policies for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) expressed in RDDL. Recent work first converts the instances of a relational domain into an instance graph, and then trains a Graph Attention Network (GAT) of fixed depth with parameters shared across instances to learn a state representation, which can be decoded to get the policy Sharma et al. [2022]. Unfortunately, this approach struggles to learn policies that exploit long-range dependencies -- a fact we formally prove in this paper. As a remedy, we first construct a novel influence graph characterized by edges capturing one-step influence (dependence) between nodes based on the transition model. We then define influence distance between two nodes as the shortest path between them in this graph -- a feature we exploit to represent long-range dependencies. We show that our architecture, referred to as Symbolic Influence Network (SINet), with its distance-based features, does not suffer from the representational issues faced by earlier approaches. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that we are competitive with existing baselines on 12 standard IPPC domains, and perform significantly better on six additional domains (including IPPC variants), designed to test a model's capability in capturing long-range dependencies. Further analysis shows that SINet automatically learns to focus on nodes that have key information for representing policies that capture long-range dependencies. 
 ID: 777 | Heavy-tailed Linear Bandit with Huber Regression   
  
 Minhyun Kang, Gi-Soo Kim  

    Abstract:   
 Linear bandit algorithms have been extensively studied and have shown successful in sequential decision tasks despite their simplicity. Many algorithms however work under the assumption that the reward is the sum of linear function of observed contexts and a sub-Gaussian error. In practical applications, errors can be heavy-tailed, especially in financial data. In such reward environments, algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian error may underexplore, resulting in suboptimal regret. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for linear bandits with heavy-tailed errors. The proposed algorithm utilizes Huber regression. When the $(1+\delta)$-th moment of the error is bounded by a constant, we show that the high-probability upper bound of the regret is $O(\sqrt{d}T^{\frac{1}{1+\delta}}(\log T)^{\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}})$, where $d$ is the dimension of context variables, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\delta\in (0,1]$. This bound improves on the state-of-the-art regret bound of the Median of Means and Truncation algorithm by a factor of $\sqrt{\log T}$ and $\sqrt{d}$ for the case where the time horizon $T$ is unknown. We also remark that when $\delta=1$, the order is the same as the regret bound of linear bandit algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian errors. We support our theoretical findings with synthetic experiments. 
 ID: 780 | Best Arm Identification in Rare Events   
  
 Anirban Bhattacharjee, Sushant Vijayan, Sandeep Kumar Juneja  

  TL;DR:  We consider bandit problems where arms return rewards sporadically, and examine interesting approximations that speed up existing best arm algorithms.   Abstract:   
 We consider the best arm identification (BAI) problem in the stochastic multi-armed bandit framework where each arm has a tiny probability of realizing large rewards while with overwhelming probability the reward is zero. A key application of this framework is in online advertising where click rates of advertisements could be a fraction of a single percent and final conversion to sales, while highly profitable, may again be a small fraction of the click rates. Lately, algorithms for BAI problems have been developed that minimise sample complexity while providing statistical guarantees on the correct arm selection. As we observe, these algorithms can be computationally prohibitive. We exploit the fact that the reward process for each arm is well approximated by a Compound Poisson process to arrive at algorithms that are faster, with a small increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem in an asymptotic regime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward amounts increase to infinity. This helps illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm. It also sheds light on the underlying structure of the optimal BAI algorithms in the rare event setting. 
 ID: 789 | Exact Count of Boundary Pieces of ReLU Classifiers: Towards the Proper Complexity Measure for Classification   
  
 Pawel Piwek, Adam Klukowski, Tianyang Hu  

  TL;DR:  We propose a method to count the exact number of boundary pieces of ReLU classifiers and empirically demonstrate distinctive features of such boundary complexity vs other function complexities.   Abstract:   
 Classic learning theory suggests that proper regularization is the key to good generalization and robustness. In classification, current training schemes only target the complexity of the classifier itself, which can be misleading and ineffective. Instead, we advocate directly measuring the complexity of the decision boundary. Existing literature is limited in this area with few well-established definitions of boundary complexity. As a proof of concept, we start by analyzing ReLU neural networks, whose boundary complexity can be conveniently characterized by the number of affine pieces. With the help of tropical geometry, we develop a novel method that can explicitly count the exact number of boundary pieces, and as a by-product, the exact number of total affine pieces. Numerical experiments are conducted and distinctive properties of our boundary complexity are uncovered. First, the boundary piece count appears largely independent of other measures, e.g., total piece count, and $l_2$ norm of weights, during the training process. Second, the boundary piece count is negatively correlated with robustness, where popular robust training techniques, e.g., adversarial training or random noise injection, are found to reduce the number of boundary pieces.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  In this paper, we leverage constraint generation methods to obtain an efficient learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRCs).   Abstract:   
 High-dimensional} data is common in multiple areas, such as health care and genomics, where the number of features can be hundreds of thousands. In such scenarios, the large number of features often lead to inefficient learning. Constraint generation methods have recently enabled efficient learning of L1-regularized support vector machines (SVM). In this paper, we leverage such methods to obtain an efficient learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRC). The proposed iterative algorithm also provides a sequence of worst-case error probabilities and performs feature selection. Experiments on multiple high-dimensional datasets show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in high-dimensional scenarios. In addition, the worst-case error probability provides useful information about the classifier performance, and the features selected by the algorithm are competitive with the state-of-the-art. 
 ID: 797 | Inference for Probabilistic Dependency Graphs   
 [spotlight]  
 Oliver Ethan Richardson, Joseph Halpern, Christopher De Sa  

  TL;DR:  we give the first inference algorithm for probabilistic dependency graphs, prove that it is correct and runs in polynomial time, implement it, and evaluate its performance.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic dependency graphs (PDGs) are a flexible class of probabilistic graphical models, subsuming Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs. They can also capture inconsistent beliefs, and provide a way of measuring the degree of this inconsistency. We present the first tractable inference algorithm for PDGs with discrete variables, making the asymptotic complexity of PDG inference similar that of the graphical models they generalize. The key components are: (1) the observation that PDG inference can be reduced to convex optimization with exponential cone constraints, (2) a construction that allows us to express these problems compactly for PDGs of boundeed treewidth, for which we needed to further develop the theory of PDGs, and (3) an appeal to interior point methods that can solve such problems in polynomial time. We verify the correctness and time complexity of our approach, and provide an implementation of it. We then evaluate our implementation, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines approaches. 
 ID: 804 | Fast Proximal Gradient Descent for Support Regularized Sparse Graph   
 [spotlight]  
 Dongfang Sun, Yingzhen Yang  

  TL;DR:  We propose Support Regularized Sparse Graph (SRSG) and a fast proximal gradient descent method to solve the non-convex optimization problem of SRSG with the convergence matching the Nesterov's optimal convergence rate.   Abstract:   
 Sparse graphs built by sparse representation has been demonstrated to be effective in clustering high-dimensional data. Albeit the compelling empirical performance, the vanilla sparse graph ignores the geometric information of the data by performing sparse representation for each datum separately. In order to obtain a sparse graph aligned with the local geometric structure of data, we propose a novel Support Regularized Sparse Graph, abbreviated as SRSG, for data clustering. SRSG encourages local smoothness on the neighborhoods of nearby data points by a well-defined support regularization term. We propose a fast proximal gradient descent method to solve the non-convex optimization problem of SRSG with the convergence matching the Nesterov's optimal convergence rate of first-order methods on smooth and convex objective function with Lipschitz continuous gradient. Extensive experimental results on various real data sets demonstrate the superiority of SRSG over other competing clustering methods.

 UbiComp / ISWC   

 Past Conferences   
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing ( UbiComp  ) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.   
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing ( ISWC  ) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.   
 A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

 UAI 2018 - Call for Papers  
   
 Deadline: Friday, March 9th 2018.  
   
 The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is one of the premier international conferences on research related to knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning in the presence of uncertainty. UAI 2018 will be held in Monterey, California, on August 6-10, 2018. The main conference will take place on August 7-9, with tutorials on August 6 and workshops on August 10.  
 Technical Areas  
   
 UAI solicits submission of papers which describe novel theories, methodology and applications related to knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning under uncertainty. A non-exclusive list of subject areas can be found here  . We welcome submissions by authors who are new to the UAI conference, or on new and emerging topics. We encourage submissions on applications, especially those that inspire new methodologies.  
 Important dates for authors  
   
 March 9th, 2018, 11:59 pm SST (Samoa Standard Time): Paper submission deadline. 
  May 16th, 2018: Author notification. * 
  July 6th, 2018: Camera ready due. 
  August 6th, 2018: Conference starts. 
  *likely date to be adapted accordingly to take place before the NIPS submission deadline.  
 Evaluation Criteria  
   
 Submitted papers will be reviewed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact and clarity of writing. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well executed, and repeatable. Submissions that mark "applications" as the primary subject area will be reviewed according to appropriate criteria and by reviewers with appropriate backgrounds.  
 Formatting Guidelines  
   
 Submissions should be formatted in the UAI format and papers (including figures and text) are limited to 9 pages in length. An additional 10th page is allowed containing only references. Optional submissions of supplementary materials are allowed. However, reviewers are under no obligation to look at the submitted supplementary materials, and will base their review primarily on the main paper. Authors should consult the UAI website for full details regarding the paper preparation and submission guidelines.  
 Dual Submission Policy  
   
 Papers that are currently under review or have already been accepted or published in a refereed venue, including conferences and journals, may not be submitted. Papers that have appeared on non-peered reviewed websites (like arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have a publication proceedings) do not violate the policy. Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available when possible.  
 Anonymous Review  
   
 The review process is double blind. Please make sure that the submission does not disclose the author's identities or affiliation. The submission will be rejected otherwise.  
 Reviewing Process  
   
 The OpenReview  system will be used to manage paper submission and the review process. OpenReview will allow authors to respond to public comments anytime, even before the official rebuttal period. The UAI 2018 OpenReview website will be accessible via https://openreview.net/group?id=auai.org/UAI/2018  on Wednesday, February 7th.  
 Papers that are not accepted to the conference will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not), although the OpenReview site will maintain the reviews, the comments, and links to the versions submitted to UAI.  
 Presentation and Publication  
   
 All accepted papers will be presented at the conference either as contributed talks or as posters, and will be published in the Conference Proceedings. At least one of the paper's authors should be present at the conference to present the work.  
 AIJ and JAIR Fast-track  
   
 A selected set of top-rated papers may be nominated for fast track reviewing at participating journals, including the AI Journal (AIJ) and the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR). Nominated authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their UAI-18 papers for fast-track consideration.

 Introduction 
 Ubiquitous sensors, devices, networks and information are paving the way towards a smart world in which computational intelligence is distributed throughout the physical environment to provide reliable and relevant services to people. This ubiquitous intelligence will change the computing landscape because it will enable new breeds of applications and systems to be developed and the realm of computing possibilities will be significantly extended. By enhancing everyday objects with intelligence many tasks and processes could be simplified, more efficient and more enjoyable. Ubiquitous computing is to create such intelligent/smart environments, services and applications.

 Ubiquitous sensors, devices, networks and information are paving the way towards a smart world in which computational intelligence is distributed throughout the physical environment to provide reliable and relevant services to people. This ubiquitous intelligence will change the computing landscape because it will enable new breeds of applications and systems to be developed and the realm of computing possibilities will be significantly extended. By enhancing everyday objects with intelligence, many tasks and processes could be simplified, more efficient and more enjoyable. Ubiquitous computing is to create such intelligent/smart environments, services and applications. Research on ubiquitous intelligence is an exciting field covering many disciplines. A series of grand challenges exist to move from the current computing services to the ubiquitous intelligent/smart things. UIC 2024 is the next edition of the successful series, previously held as UIC 2023 in Portsmouth UK, UIC 2022 in Haikou China, UIC 2021 in Atlanta USA, UIC 2020 Melbourne AU, UIC 2019 Leicester UK, UIC 2018 Guangzhou China, UIC 2017 San Jose USA, UIC 2016 Toulouse France, UIC 2015 Beijing China, UIC 2014 Bali Indonesia, UIC 2013 Vietri sul Mare Italy, UIC 2012 Fukuoka Japan, UIC 2011 Banff Canada, UIC 2010 Xi'an China, UIC 2009 Brisbane Australia, UIC 2008 Oslo Norway, UIC 2007 Hong Kong, UIC 2006 Wuhan China, UIC 2005 Nagasaki Japan, and UIC 2004 Taipei.

 Abstract  
 Cognitive tools for uncovering useful abstractions  
 In the 17th century, the Cartesian coordinate system was groundbreaking. It exposed the unity between algebra and geometry, accelerating the development of the math that took humans to the moon. It was not just another concept, but a cognitive tool that people could wield to express abstract ideas in visual form, thereby expanding their capacity to think and generate new insights about a variety of other problems. Research in my lab aims to uncover the psychological mechanisms that explain how people have come to deploy these technologies in such innovative ways to learn, share knowledge, and create new things. In the first part of this talk, I will provide an overview of our recent work investigating drawing — one of our most enduring and versatile tools. Across several empirical and computational studies, I’ll argue that drawing not only provides a window into how we perceive and understand the visual world, but also accelerates humans’ ability to learn and communicate useful abstractions. In the second part, I will describe an emerging line of work investigating how humans discover new abstractions when building physical structures, and externalize these abstractions to support planning and collaboration. I will close by noting the broader implications of embracing such complex, naturalistic behaviors for advancing theories of human cognition and enhancing real-world impact, including in AI and education.

 Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2023  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format  , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2- column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.  
 Revised Papers from Prior Submission:  To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2023 paper submission process.  
 Submission Information  
 Submission Platform   
 All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS 2.0 by the abstract and paper deadline | . 
  In PCS 2.0, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2023” and “UIST 2023 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, please consider papers in the range of ~7,500-10,000 words. 
    
 Accompanying Video   
 Optional, but highly encouraged 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  No more than five minutes long 
  Size: < 200 MB 
  Subtitles are required (3-day grace period) using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Maximum File Size   
 Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB 
    
 Anonymity   
 Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) | [anonymity policy] 
    
 Selection Process   
 Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers 
    
 Publication   
 Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Final Publication Format   
 As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library. 
  For | LaTeX authors | , your source files will be used to auto-generate 1) a double-column PDF ( | example PDF | ), and 2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) that will be placed in the Digital Library. 
  For | Word authors | , you will need to submit your paper in | single-column format | to correctly auto-generate 1) a double-column PDF ( | example PDF | ), and 2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) in the Digital Library. 
    
 Presentation Format   
 Talk at the conference by one or more authors of the paper 
  Update: Due to a large increase in the number of submissions, we have less time for each submission than initially communicated. All papers will have 8 minutes for presentation, followed by 4 minutes for Q&A. An assigned session chair will help moderate. 
    
 Video Preview   
 Video previews are mandatory. 
  Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec

  Size: < 150 MB 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
  Please see the | video guide | for more information on producing a video preview. 
  We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under | Making Video Figures Accessible | . 
    
 Demo   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST | demo session | . 

 Additional Notes  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format | , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2- column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template. 
  We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
  We will also use a two-week rebuttal period for papers (Thursday, May 25 to Thursday, June 8, 2023). Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Papers Co-chairs as much as possible. 
  The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. The video is due on Friday, April 7, 2023. 
  Accessibility is a key concern for the UIST 2023 Program Chairs | . We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible and will allow 6 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. These additional materials are due on Tuesday, April 11, 2023. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2023 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | accessibility2023@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the April 11, 2023 deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.

  Demos  
 Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR and large interactive installations.  
 All demo submissions go through a rigorous curation process. The demo chairs will announce recommendations for presentation formats, logistics and provide early access for technical setup before the conference.

  In PCS 2.0, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2023” and “UIST 2023 Demos, respectively, and press “Go.” 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 Demo Abstract 
  We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
   
  Floor Plan 
  The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
  This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. 
   
  Demo Video 
  This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work 
  It shows the working demo in appropriate detail 
  It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website 
  Length: up to 5 min 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec

  Size: < 150 MB 
  Length: 30 seconds 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Anonymity   
 Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process. 
    
 Selection Process   
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
  Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
    
 Publication   
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
  Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
    
 Lab Demos   
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
    
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission   
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track 
    
 Novelty of Work   
 Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed 
    
 Demos of Accepted UIST 2023 Papers   
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo have to  submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | (1) Regular demo submission  : authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors. | (2) Fast track  : Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). 
    
 Changes in author list and affiliations   
 Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS 
  It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission 
  It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission

  Workshops  
 Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping, in combination with talks and keynotes. Workshops activities should target an audience of approximately 20 participants. All workshop participants will be required to register for the main conference, and there will be an additional fee to attend workshops to cover the additional logistical expenses.  
 Given space limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop. Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other. These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be more lightly reviewed than papers by an external jury.

  Visions  
 Back for its sixth year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI. The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are. The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate issues might be: future trends, foundational technologies that we need to make progress on, significant, compelling problems that the community might address, something that is missing, or an alternative perspective on what we do.

 Selection Process   
 Juried by the UIST Student Innovation Contest chairs and invited panelists. 
  Maximum 10 teams will be selected. 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is requested to present their demo during SIC sessions and to speak with conference attendees. 

 The UIST SIC is your opportunity to shine and impress the world with your creative ideas! Participants will demo their work during the conference program, and contest winners will be announced during the conference. A jury composed of senior UIST community members will select one team to receive the SIC jury award. On top of that, conference attendees will get a chance to vote for their favorite teams in the People’s Choice category. Each selected team will have access to LLM API usage, which is made possible through our generous sponsor Anthropic AI.  
 UIST 2023 SIC Challenge: Beyond Words  
   
 Your goal is to design and implement a novel interactive system, utilizing the LLM API provided to you. This system should leverage LLMs, and you may incorporate any other prototyping resources available. This year, we encourage participants to be innovative and think outside the box when integrating LLMs into interactive systems. Specifically, we encourage teams to explore novel use cases or applications of LLMs, such as those that incorporate different input/output modalities—exploring how LLMs can interact with audio, images, videos, etc., and broadening design possibilities.  
 To successfully address this challenge, you need to figure out what task(s) you want your system to support, and what interaction(s) you want your system to enable. Your system should motivate the use case and articulate a clear set of assumptions on how it will benefit users. Finally, your system does not have to be limited to one user— ideas that involve well-executed, multi-user, simultaneous interactions are often crowd favorites at UIST! We favor radical ideas that showcase fresh angles and novel uses of LLMs in interactive systems. We also encourage you to think about how you can connect LLMs to your own research. You will submit a video of your project demo by October 25th, and demonstrate your idea live at the in-person UIST event on October 29th - November 1st. Your video will be uploaded and shared on the official ACM SIGCHI YouTube channel (e.g., see UIST 2022 SIC videos  ).  
 Anthropic Claude API  
   
 This year, we’ll provide selected teams with access to the Anthropic Console. The Anthropic’s console provides access to LLM models with unique features.  
 One of the strongest LLM models: strong performance in code understanding/generation and quantitative reasoning (e.g., solving math problems) and scores well in exams such as the GRE and Bar 
  Long context support of up to 100,000 tokens - useful for processing very long documents (e.g., hundreds of pages, books) 
  Claude API includes Instant versions of the model designed for very fast responses 
  Logging into the Anthropic console provides access to the web-based chat GUI which allows for fast and easy experimentation. The console also allows for the creation of API keys for integration into external systems and applications. API keys support unlimited queries but may be subject to a rate limit. Use of the Anthropic must adhere to the Acceptable Use Policy ( https://console.anthropic.com/legal  ).  
 The API can be queried with standard REST requests, and documentation and API reference are available online ( https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs  ). Anthropic provides example code for Python and Typescript ( https://github.com/anthropics  ) and example applications to illustrate API usage.  
 We highly suggest incorporating any other software or hardware available at your disposal, to make more innovative and compelling projects:  
 Any additional APIs you want to integrate (object detection, OCR, speech recognition) 
  Any additional devices you want to use (gesture control, camera, robotic arm). 
  If you consider integrating various I/O modalities with LLMs, you can use tools to transform these modalities into text or generate them based on texts. For instance, you could employ image captioning and object recognition to convert images or videos into text that LLMs can understand. Additionally, there are a growing number of open-sourced AI models that combine various modalities, which you can consider using in your system. For example, the BLIP-2  and LLaVA  models for image-to-text processing; CLIP  and CLAP  for joint embedding spaces of text-image and text-audio, respectively.  
 To assist the students in developing their applications, we (the SIC chairs) will provide technical support if they have any questions.  
 Application Areas and Design Space  
 You can build and design your system in many configurations, which affords the exploration of numerous design primitives. The primary requirements are to utilize the provided Claude API and to ensure that users can interact with the system in a meaningful way. With these requirements in mind, you may focus on one or more application areas. Below, we have listed some example application areas and corresponding existing works for inspiration.  
   
 (From top-left: SayCan, TaleBrush, LLM4UI, Generative Agents, Opal, Visual Captions)  
 LLM + Robotics (E.g. | SayCan | , | Stargazer | ) 
  LLM + Visual Generation (E.g. | Opal | , | Promptify | , | 3DALL-E | ) 
  LLM + Agent/Gaming (E.g. | Generative Agents | ) 
  LLM + Direct Manipulation (E.g. | TaleBrush | ) 
  LLM + Visual Communication (E.g. | Visual Captions | ) 
  LLM + UI/Code (E.g., | LLM4UI | , | Stylette | , | PromptInfuser | ) 
  LLM + Audio/Music/Podcast (E.g. | Podly.ai | ) 
  LLM + Learning/Education (E.g. | Khanmingo | ) 
  Novel Interface for LLM (E.g. | Graphologue | , | Sensecape | ) 
  LLM + Sensor/Activity Detection 
  LLM + Accessibility 
  LLM + Fabrication 
  Many Others! 
  Logistics  
 Team members from selected proposals will be given an Anthropic account that allows access to a chat interface and API keys, which can be integrated into custom applications. Anthropic’s website and GitHub repositories contain documentation and example code that could be useful for development. Teams are encouraged to open source their efforts, and even build on each other’s work. To get you moving fast, we will also provide a list of tutorials and mentoring sessions to ensure you have everything you need to make your vision a reality!  
 Ethics and Broader Impact Statement  
 In our commitment to responsible innovation, all proposals must include an Ethics and Broader Impact statement. Authors submitting proposals must follow the NeurIPS Ethics Guidelines  . In particular, “whenever there are risks associated with the proposed methods, methodology, application or data collection and data usage, authors are expected to elaborate on the rationale of their decision and potential mitigations.” We ask the authors to reflect on the potential ethical dimensions of their project at its inception. This statement should be a concise exploration of potential ethical concerns, biases, and societal implications that the project could raise. Additionally, authors should describe how they plan to mitigate any potential negative outcomes. For detailed writing guide, please read A Guide to Writing the NeurIPS Impact Statement  . Should you have an questions, please reach out to the SIC co-chairs at sic2023@uist.org  .

Not to mention the free conference registration and SV T-shirt! We are happy to report that we plan on continuing the “rockstar” Q&A sessions with senior researchers; these will most likely be held virtually the week following the conference.  
 If you are a UIST Student Volunteer, you get:  
 Free conference registration 
  Exclusive SV “rockstar” Q&A sessions with senior faculty and researchers 
  Access to a tight SV community 
  A free UIST 2023 SV T-shirt 
  The chance to closely work together with both presenters and the conference organizing committee 
  Logistics and Duties  
 Our goal is to make sure SVs can attend the sessions that they are interested in. In 2023, we expect to have around 35 SVs who will work approximately 14 hours before or during the conference.  
 SVs will do a mix of tasks before and during the conference. Any hours spent doing pre-conference tasks will count towards your total SV hours. Some pre-conference tasks may need to be done several weeks before the conference begins; please indicate your availability to do pre-conference tasks on the lottery questionnaire and we will try to accommodate everyone’s preferences as best as possible.  
 UIST 2023 is intended to be a fully in-person conference (see Attending  ). Most SV tasks will be in person and we expect all SVs to attend the conference in person.  
 Thanks so much for applying! We look forward to seeing you at UIST 2023!!

 Ubiquitous sensors, devices, networks and information are paving the way toward a smart world in which computational intelligence is distributed throughout the physical environment to provide reliable and relevant services to people. This ubiquitous intelligence will change the computing landscape because it will enable new breeds of applications and systems to be developed, and the realm of computing possibilities will be significantly extended. By enhancing everyday objects with intelligence, many tasks and processes could be simplified, the physical spaces where people interact, like workplaces and homes, could become more efficient, safer and more enjoyable. Ubiquitous computing, or pervasive computing, uses these many “smart things” or “u-things” to create smart environments, services and applications. A smart thing can be endowed with different levels of intelligence, and may be c- text-aware, active, interactive, reactive, proactive, assistive, adaptive, automated, sentient, perceptual, cognitive, autonomic and/or thinking. Research on ubiquitous intelligence is an emerging research field covering many disciplines. A series of grand challenges exists to move from the current level of computing services to the smart world of adaptive and intelligent services. Started in 2005, the series of UIC conferences has been held in Taipei, Nagasaki, Three Gorges (China), Hong Kong, Oslo and Brisbane. The proceedings contain the papers presented at the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing (UIC 2010), held in Xi’an, China, October 26–29, 2010. The conference was accompanied by six vibrant workshops on a variety of research challenges within the area of ubiquitous intelligence and computing.

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 PCS Submissions     
 Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2024  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format  , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.  
 Your submission must be original  . UIST only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to UIST 2024 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to the author guide   for details. Additionally, authors should avoid generated context by AI-agents (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar).  
 Revised Papers from Prior Submissions:  To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2024 paper submission process.  
 Submission Information  
 Submission Platform   
 All required materials must be | submitted electronically to PCS | by the abstract and paper deadline. 
  In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2024” and “UIST 2024 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline. 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 Required Paper PDF and source files

  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, consider | Short Papers | being submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
  Standard Length Papers | being submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words are considered standard length (about 7,000-8,000 words on average).

 Publication   
 Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Final Publication Format   
 As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library. 
  For | LaTeX authors | , your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( | example PDF | ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) that will be placed in the Digital Library. 
  For | Word authors | , you will need to submit your paper in | single-column format | to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( | example PDF | ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) in the Digital Library. 
    
 Presentation Format   
 Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper 
    
 Video Preview   
 Video previews are mandatory. 
  Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec

  We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under | Making Video Figures Accessible | . 
    
 Demo   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST | demo session | . 

 Additional Notes  
 We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
  Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible. 
  The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2024 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | accessibility2024@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.

  Posters  
 Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress, and work that is already presented in other venues but to share more with the UIST community. Posters are non-archival and will be more lightly reviewed (curated) than papers.  
 For questions, please email the poster chairs at posters2024@uist.org  .

  Demos  
 Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos — from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR and large interactive installations. All demo submissions go through a rigorous curation process. The demo chairs will announce recommendations for presentation formats, logistics and provide early access for technical setup before the conference.  
 For questions, please email the demo chairs at demos2024@uist.org  .

  In PCS 2.0, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2024” and “UIST 2024 Demos, respectively, and press “Go.” 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 Demo Abstract 
  We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
   
  Floor Plan 
  The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
  This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. 
   
  Demo Video 
  Optional, but strongly encouraged for regular demo submissions. 
  This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work 
  It shows the working demo in appropriate detail 
  It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website 
  Length: up to 5 min 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Preview Video   
 Video previews are mandatory 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  Size: < 150 MB 
  Length: 30 seconds 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Anonymity   
 Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process. 
    
 Selection Process   
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
  Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
    
 Publication   
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
  Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
    
 Lab Demos   
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
    
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission   
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track 
    
 Novelty of Work   
 Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed 
    
 Demos of Accepted UIST 2024 Papers   
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo have to  submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | (1) Regular demo submission  : authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors. Since demo publications are non-archival, authors are welcome to adapt content from their full UIST paper or other prior publication. We encourage authors to use a distinct title from the full paper (e.g., “Demonstration of …”) to avoid confusion in citations and search results. | (2) Fast track  : Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). We intend to accept as many fast track demos as logistics and space allows. 
    
 Changes in author list and affiliations   
 Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS 
  It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission 
  It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission

  Workshops  
 Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping. Workshops activities should target the active participation of approximately 20-60 participants. Workshop participants will not   be required to register for the main conference; there will be a fee to attend workshops.  
 Given space and activity limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop.  
 Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other. We encourage not just typical UIST topics of interest but also intersections between UIST and other communities within and beyond HCI. These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be selected by the organizers based on topic fit, quality of anticipated interaction, and anticipated interest.  
 For questions, please email the workshop chairs at workshops2024@uist.org  .

  Visions  
 Back for its seventh year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI.  
 The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are.  
 The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate topics might be:  
 future trends 
  foundational technologies that we need to make progress on 
  significant, compelling problems that the community might address 
  topics that are absent from the community’s work 
  an alternative perspective on what we do

 Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2024  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format  , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.  
 Your submission must be original  . UIST only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to UIST 2024 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to the author guide   for details. Additionally, authors should avoid generated context by AI-agents (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar).  
 Revised Papers from Prior Submissions:  To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2024 paper submission process.  
 Submission Information  
 Submission Platform   
 All required materials must be | submitted electronically to PCS | by the abstract and paper deadline. 
  In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2024” and “UIST 2024 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline. 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 Required Paper PDF and source files 
  We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the | double-column format | ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, consider | Short Papers | being submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
  Standard Length Papers | being submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words are considered standard length (about 7,000-8,000 words on average).

 Demo   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST | demo session | . 

 Additional Notes  
 We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
  Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible. 
  The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2024 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | accessibility2024@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.

  Posters  
 Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress, and work that is already presented in other venues but to share more with the UIST community. Posters are non-archival and will be more lightly reviewed (curated) than papers.  
 For questions, please email the poster chairs at posters2024@uist.org  .

  Demos  
 Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos — from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR and large interactive installations. All demo submissions go through a rigorous curation process. The demo chairs will announce recommendations for presentation formats, logistics and provide early access for technical setup before the conference.  
 For questions, please email the demo chairs at demos2024@uist.org  .

  In PCS 2.0, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2024” and “UIST 2024 Demos, respectively, and press “Go.” 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 Demo Abstract 
  We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
   
  Floor Plan 
  The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
  This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. 
   
  Demo Video 
  Optional, but strongly encouraged for regular demo submissions. 
  This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work 
  It shows the working demo in appropriate detail 
  It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website 
  Length: up to 5 min 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Preview Video   
 Video previews are mandatory 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  Size: < 150 MB 
  Length: 30 seconds 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Anonymity   
 Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process. 
    
 Selection Process   
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
  Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
    
 Publication   
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
  Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
    
 Lab Demos   
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
    
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission   
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track 
    
 Novelty of Work   
 Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed 
    
 Demos of Accepted UIST 2024 Papers   
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo have to  submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | (1) Regular demo submission  : authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors. Since demo publications are non-archival, authors are welcome to adapt content from their full UIST paper or other prior publication. We encourage authors to use a distinct title from the full paper (e.g., “Demonstration of …”) to avoid confusion in citations and search results. | (2) Fast track  : Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). We intend to accept as many fast track demos as logistics and space allows. 
    
 Changes in author list and affiliations   
 Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS 
  It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission 
  It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission

  Workshops  
 Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping. Workshops activities should target the active participation of approximately 20-60 participants. Workshop participants will not   be required to register for the main conference; there will be a fee to attend workshops.  
 Given space and activity limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop.  
 Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other. We encourage not just typical UIST topics of interest but also intersections between UIST and other communities within and beyond HCI. These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be selected by the organizers based on topic fit, quality of anticipated interaction, and anticipated interest.  
 For questions, please email the workshop chairs at workshops2024@uist.org  .

  Visions  
 Back for its seventh year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI.  
 The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are.  
 The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate topics might be:  
 future trends 
  foundational technologies that we need to make progress on 
  significant, compelling problems that the community might address 
  topics that are absent from the community’s work 
  an alternative perspective on what we do

 Research Interests  
 What are the challenges in creating interfaces that allow a user to intuitively act and express his/her intentions? Today's Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems include virtual / augmented reality are limited, and exploit only visual and auditory sensations. However, in daily life, we exploit a variety of input and output modalities, and modalities that involve contact with our bodies can dramatically affect our ability to experience and express ourselves in physical and virtual worlds. Using modern physiological understandings of sensation and perception, emerging electronic devices, and agile computational methods, we now have an opportunity to design a new generation of "Human-Computer Integrated" systems.  
 We have archived several improvements that use multi/cross modal interfaces for enhancing human I/O. They include Transparent Cockpit, Stop-Motion Goggle, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation, JINS MEME (electrooculography (EOG)-based smart glasses) and Superhuman Sports.  
 Our challenges include:  
  (1) Understanding human factors  
  (2) Enhancing human I/O  
  (3) Designing new body schema  
  (4) Experience engineering and entertainment computing

 Call for Papers: Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025  
 The call for papers is now open.  

 The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy. USEC ’25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas. We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields.  
 To honor significant contributions that have had a lasting impact on the field, USEC ’25 will also feature a Test of Time Award  . This award will celebrate research demonstrating enduring relevance and influence in usable security and privacy over the past 14 years of USEC. We will invite nominations for this award from the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and authors submitting their works to USEC ’25. This recognition will honor research that continues to shape and inspire current and future investigations in the discipline.  

 Submission Guidelines for Papers  
 All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. All papers should be written in English. We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use the templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events  .  
 Research Track:  The research track is intended to report on mature work that has been completed. The goal of the USEC’s research track is to disseminate results of interest to the broader usable security and privacy community. Papers must not be more than 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Try to scale the length of the paper according to the contributions you describe therein. Authors have the option to attach to their paper‘s supplementary appendices with study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Meta-Science Track:  The Meta-Science Track is intended to report on mature work and seeks to disseminate results that contribute to the broader understanding and improvement of research practices, including the replicability of studies and the systematization of existing knowledge. Submissions in this track may include comprehensive evaluations of research methodologies, studies that replicate and verify prior findings, meta-analyses that synthesize existing literature, and SoK papers that systematically organize and analyze research in a specific domain. Papers must not exceed 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Vision Track:  The vision track is intended to report on work in progress or concrete ideas for work that has yet to begin. The focus of the vision track is to spark discussion with the goal of providing the authors helpful feedback, pointers to potentially related investigations, and new ideas to explore. Suitable submissions to the vision track include traditional work-in-progress pieces such as preliminary results of pre-studies but also research proposals and position papers outlining future research. Papers must be up to 5 pages in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.  
 The submission portal for papers: https://usec25.hotcrp.com/    
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Areas of Interest  
 Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
  New applications of existing models or technology 
  Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned 
  Security testing of new or existing usability features 
  Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy 
  Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research 
    
 Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments 
  Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience 
  Systematization of Knowledge 
  Inclusive security and privacy 
  Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research 
  Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems 
  Usability in smart manufacturing 

 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline: | 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, | Anywhere-on-earth (AOE) 
  Reviews Due: 16 December 2024 
  Discussion Period: 16-19 December 2024 
  Notification of Acceptance: 20 December 2024 
  Camera Ready Deadline: 28 January 2025 
  Workshop Date: 24 February 2025 
  Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.

Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Areas of Interest  
 Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
  New applications of existing models or technology 
  Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned 
  Security testing of new or existing usability features 
  Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy 
  Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research 
    
 Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments 
  Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience 
  Systematization of Knowledge 
  Inclusive security and privacy 
  Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research 
  Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems 
  Usability in smart manufacturing 

 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline: | 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, | Anywhere-on-earth (AOE) 
  Reviews Due: 16 December 2024 
  Discussion Period: 16-19 December 2024 
  Notification of Acceptance: 20 December 2024 
  Camera Ready Deadline: 28 January 2025 
  Workshop Date: 24 February 2025 
  Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.

 Call for Full and Short Papers  

 The 33rd International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2025) is the premier international conference bringing together research in AI and HCI to support effective human-AI collaboration via interactive systems that can model, adapt and personalize to their users  .  

 ACM UMAP  2025 is sponsored by ACM SIGCHI  and SIGWEB  . User Modeling Inc.  , as the core Steering Committee, oversees the conference organization. ACM UMAP operates under the ACM Conference Code of Conduct  . The main conference proceedings, published by ACM, will be part of the ACM Digital Library.  

 The theme of ACM UMAP 2025  is “Shaping Personalization and FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) in Human-Centered Generative AI”   .  

 ACM UMAP  2025 will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from around the world to discuss the latest developments in human-centered approaches to design and use AI systems that adapt to human needs while ensuring user control, fairness, accountability, transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability. While we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only. As always, contributions from academia, industry, and other organizations discussing open challenges or novel research approaches are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to claims (e.g., user study, system evaluation, computational analysis).

 Submission Guidelines  

 All submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system, https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025  , by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.  

 Format.  We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM two-column format:  
 Long papers | ( | 8 pages | at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value. They should reflect more complex innovations or studies and should have a more thorough discussion of related work. Each accepted long paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented in a plenary session as part of the main conference program. 
  Short papers | ( | 4 pages | at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper – they are not “work-in-progress” reports but rather complete reports on a smaller or simpler-to-describe but complete research work on advances that can be described, set into context, and evaluated concisely. In particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance to this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental validation or lacking a strong theoretical foundation. Each accepted short paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented either as an oral presentation or at a poster session as part of the main conference program. 
  We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.  

 Anonymity.  Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection. It is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization.  

 Templates.  Following the ACM Publication Workflow  , all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format  . Instructions for authors are given below:  
 LaTeX: | Please use the latest version of the | Primary Article Template | – LaTeX to create your submission. Start the document with the \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} command to generate the output in a double-column format. Please see the | LaTeX documentation | and | ACM’s LaTeX best practices guide | for further instructions, ignoring the single-column instructions. Do not use the “manuscript” option, otherwise, the document will not be compiled in double-column, as required. Check the sample-sigconf.tex file included in the template package for a formatting example. To ensure 100% compatibility with The ACM Publishing System (TAPS), please restrict the use of packages to the | whitelist of approved LaTeX packages | . 
  Overleaf: | (use \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | preparing your article with Overleaf | . 
  Word: | Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | preparing your article with Microsoft Word 

 Accessibility.  Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. The descriptive text will be displayed in place of a float if the float cannot be loaded. This benefits the author and it broadens the reader base for the author’s work. Moreover, the alt text provides in-depth float descriptions to search engine crawlers, which helps to properly index these floats. Additionally, authors should follow the ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures  .  

 Submission Policy.  All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy  , which is why submitted manuscripts should not be currently under review at another publication venue. Particularly, please consider the following ACM’s publication policies:  
 “By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all | ACM Publications Policies | , including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.” | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects 
  “Please ensure that you and your co-authors | obtain an ORCID ID | , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a | commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors | . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.” 

 Review Process  

 Review.  ACM UMAP uses a double-blind  review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.  

 Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field. Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on whether the length is appropriate for the contribution. In addition, ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation  , offering a small window for authors to optionally discuss the initial decision of their submission, enhancing the transparency and quality of the reviewing process.  

 The ACM Code of Ethics  gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Furthermore, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection.  

 Registration and Presentation Policy  

 Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration  , completed by the early registration date cut-off  . Each accepted paper must be presented in person  to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM  , and available via the ACM Digital Library  . The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of UMAP 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

 Camera-ready Submission  

 Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting  . Users of the Word template must use either the version for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats, such as Open Office, etc., are not admitted) for the camera-ready submission to avoid incompatibility issues.  

 Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided after acceptance. This might include instructions to prepare a video of the accepted contribution. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be later submitted using ACM’s new production platform  , where authors will be able to review PDF and HTML output formats before publication.  

 Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations  

 ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.

 Overview  
 The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting.  
 We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.  
 Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.  
 There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers.  
 Submission Type: Full vs. Short  
 USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper. For further details, see the submission instructions  .  
 Deployed Systems Track  
 USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track.  
 Early Rejection Notifications  
 USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent.  
 Authors' Response Period  
 USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above.  
 Confidentiality  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 On the Use of Generative AI  
 While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers including sections generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org  .  
 Questions?  
 Please direct any questions to the program co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org  or to the USENIX office at submissionspolicy@usenix.org  .

 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025)  
 July 14–19, 2025  
 Washington, DC and Online  
   
 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

  PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.  
 Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):  
 Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts) 
  Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data) 
  Scripts for data processing or simulations 
  Machine-generated proofs 
  Formal specifications 
  Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts) 
   
 Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of utility, and feedback is given to the authors. Issues considered include software bugs, readability of documentation and appropriate licensing. After your artifact has been approved by the committee, we will accompany the paper link on petsymposium.org  with a link to the artifact along with an artifact badge so that interested readers can find and use your artifact.
