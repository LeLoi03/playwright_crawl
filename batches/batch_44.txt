In particular, we invite the student participants of IPCO 2024 and its summer school to promote their areas of interest.  
   
  If you would like to present a poster at IPCO, please send a proposal to ipcoconf2024  (at)  gmail.com  in the following form:  
   
 The subject of the email should include | [poster] | . 
  The message should include: | Name of the presenter 
  Title of the poster 
  A short abstract of the research results to be presented 
   
  The deadline for submitting poster proposals is May 15.  
   
  The proposals sent earlier will be processed as they arrive and only undergo light refereeing. As the poster session is an informal part of IPCO, you are welcome to submit posters that have been recently presented at other venues. We plan to list the presenters on the IPCO webpage, but they will not be included in the official proceedings of IPCO.  
   
  The organizers will provide stands where the posters will be placed. The presenters will be responsible for bringing the printed posters and attending the poster during the dedicated poster session(s).  
   Scope  
 The IPCO conference is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications. The scope of IPCO is viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in integer programming and combinatorial optimization as well as revealing computational studies and novel applications of discrete optimization to practical problems.  
 Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of their recent work by November 6, 2023; see the submission guidelines below for more information. The Program Committee will select the papers to be presented on the basis of the submitted extended abstracts. Contributions are expected to be original, unpublished and not under review by journals or conferences with proceedings before the notification date (January 26, 2024). Papers violating these requirements will not be considered by the Program Committee.  
 During the conference, approximately 33 papers will be presented in single-track sessions. Each lecture will be 30 minutes long and given by one of the authors in person (on-site). The proceedings will be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science. They will contain extended abstracts of all accepted submissions. It is expected that revised and extended versions will subsequently be submitted for publication in appropriate journals, for example in the special issue of Mathematical Programming B that will be devoted to IPCO 2024.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The Best Paper Award of IPCO 2024 is awarded to the paper:  
  
  Gérard Cornuéjols, Siyue Liu and R. Ravi. Approximately Packing Dijoins via Nowhere-Zero Flows.   
 Submission Guidelines and Instructions for Authors  
 The extended abstract must not exceed 12 pages in Springer LNCS format, plus references. Please check the Springer Information for LNCS Authors  for additional information. If necessary, an appendix containing additional technical material can be added and may be considered at the discretion of the Program Committee. Alternatively, authors are encouraged to include a link to a full version in a freely accessible online repository.  
 The first page should contain the title, the authors’ names with their affiliations, and a short abstract. The introduction should be a broadly accessible exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve the results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work. In particular, the introduction should convey to the non-expert why the paper should be accepted to IPCO. Submitted extended abstracts will be reviewed according to the standards of top tier reviewed conferences. The main acceptance criteria used by the Program Committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. It is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. The claimed results must be correct and new.  
 A paper will not be considered in any of the following cases:  
 It has already been published. 
  It is under review by a journal or another conference with proceedings. 
  It has a member of the Program Committee among its authors. 
  It is submitted after the submission deadline. 
  It is not allowed to submit a paper that has been submitted to IPCO 2024 to a journal or a conference with proceedings before the notification date.

 IPCO 2024 Summer School  
   
 July 1-2, 2024  
 Speakers  
     
 Sophie Huiberts  , CNRS  : Open problems about the simplex method   
 The simplex method is a very efficient algorithm, but little is understood about why it is so. In these lectures we will learn about a few of the state-of-the-art theories for explaining this observation and what their shortcomings are. We will discuss what it takes for a mathematical model to explain an algorithm’s qualities. Following this, we question what the simplex method really is, and learn what LP solver developers teach us about where theory can go next.  
 Along the way we will talk about women’s history, Newton’s laws of motion, and the moral and political implications of the diet problem.  
 Sophie Huiberts is a CNRS researcher at LIMOS in Clermont-Ferrand, France. She performed her PhD research at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam and was a Simons fellow at Columbia University in NYC. Her research focuses on the algorithms typically incorporated in popular MIP solvers such as the simplex method, interior point methods, cutting planes and branch-and-bound.   

 Vera Traub,  University of Bonn  : Approximation algorithms for Steiner trees   
 The Steiner tree problem is one of the most studied network design problems. It asks to connect a given set of terminals in the cheapest  
  possible way.  
 In these lectures we will give an introduction to approximation algorithms for Steiner trees. In particular, we will discuss a new local search technique inspired by recent progress on related network design problems and discuss possible directions for future research.  
 Vera Traub is a professor at the University of Bonn, working in the area of combinatorial optimization and approximation algorithms. She obtained her PhD in 2020 from the University of Bonn and afterwards spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich. In 2023 she received a Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize and a Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Prize for her work on approximation algorithms for the traveling salesman problem and network design problems.   
      
 Neil Olver,  London School of Economics  : Equilibrium behaviour of flow-over-time traffic models   
 Flows over time, introduced already by Ford and Fulkerson, are by now classical objects in combinatorial optimization. Selfish routing – the study of equilibrium behaviour in network congestion games – has received a lot of attention in the past few decades. The combination of the two – the study of equilibria of truly dynamic, time-varying traffic models – is a more recent topic. In the Vickrey bottleneck model (or deterministic queueing model), congestion is modelled through time-varying queues that form whenever the flow into a link exceeds its capacity. In these lectures, I will give an overview of our theoretical understanding of equilibrium behaviour in this model, which exhibits a rich combinatorial structure. Classical tools, including LP duality, will play a starring role. Many fundamental questions remain open, and I will mention a number of them.  
 Neil Olver is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He obtained his PhD from McGill University in 2010, after which he spent several years as an Instructor in Applied Mathematics at MIT and as faculty at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam before joining LSE.  
   
  Neil works broadly in combinatorial optimization. His recent work focuses on approximation algorithms for network design problems; understanding the structure of equilibria in flow-over-time traffic models; and strongly polynomial algorithms for generalized flow problems. He has received a number of grants for his work, including VENI and VIDI grants from the Dutch Science Foundation.

 Kernelizing Temporal Exploration Problems   
 Authors:  Emmanuel Arrighi, Fedor V. Fomin, Petr A. Golovach, and Petra Wolf  
  Abstract    
 We study the kernelization of exploration problems on temporal graphs. A temporal graph consists of a finite sequence of snapshot graphs 𝒢 = (G₁, G₂, … , G_L) that share a common vertex set but might have different edge sets. The non-strict temporal exploration problem (NS-TEXP for short) introduced by Erlebach and Spooner, asks if a single agent can visit all vertices of a given temporal graph where the edges traversed by the agent are present in non-strict monotonous time steps, i.e., the agent can move along the edges of a snapshot graph with infinite speed. The exploration must at the latest be completed in the last snapshot graph. The optimization variant of this problem is the k-arb NS-TEXP problem, where the agent’s task is to visit at least k vertices of the temporal graph. We show that under standard computational complexity assumptions, neither of the problems NS-TEXP nor k-arb NS-TEXP allow for polynomial kernels in the standard parameters: number of vertices n, lifetime L, number of vertices to visit k, and maximal number of connected components per time step γ; as well as in the combined parameters L+k, L + γ, and k+γ. On the way to establishing these lower bounds, we answer a couple of questions left open by Erlebach and Spooner. We also initiate the study of structural kernelization by identifying a new parameter of a temporal graph p(𝒢) = ∑_{i=1}^L (|E(G_i)|) - |V(G)| + 1. Informally, this parameter measures how dynamic the temporal graph is. Our main algorithmic result is the construction of a polynomial (in p(𝒢)) kernel for the more general Weighted k-arb NS-TEXP problem, where weights are assigned to the vertices and the task is to find a temporal walk of weight at least k.

 Cluster Editing with Overlapping Communities   
 Authors:  Emmanuel Arrighi, Matthias Bentert, Pål Grønås Drange, Blair D. Sullivan, and Petra Wolf  
  Abstract    
 Cluster Editing, also known as correlation clustering, is a well-studied graph modification problem. In this problem, one is given a graph and allowed to perform up to k edge additions and deletions to transform it into a cluster graph, i.e., a graph consisting of a disjoint union of cliques. However, in real-world networks, clusters are often overlapping. For example, in social networks, a person might belong to several communities - e.g. those corresponding to work, school, or neighborhood. Another strong motivation comes from language networks where trying to cluster words with similar usage can be confounded by homonyms, that is, words with multiple meanings like "bat". The recently introduced operation of vertex splitting is one natural approach to incorporating such overlap into Cluster Editing. First used in the context of graph drawing, this operation allows a vertex v to be replaced by two vertices whose combined neighborhood is the neighborhood of v (and thus v can belong to more than one cluster). The problem of transforming a graph into a cluster graph using at most k edge additions, edge deletions, or vertex splits is called Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting and is known to admit a polynomial kernel with respect to k and an O(9^{k²} + n + m)-time (parameterized) algorithm. However, it was not known whether the problem is NP-hard, a question which was originally asked by Abu-Khzam et al. [Combinatorial Optimization, 2018]. We answer this in the affirmative. We further give an improved algorithm running in O(2^{7klog k} + n + m) time.

 Existential Second-Order Logic over Graphs: Parameterized Complexity   
 Authors:  Max Bannach, Florian Chudigiewitsch, and Till Tantau  
  Abstract    
 By Fagin’s Theorem, NP contains precisely those problems that can be described by formulas starting with an existential second-order quantifier, followed by only first-order quantifiers (eso formulas). Subsequent research refined this result, culminating in powerful theorems that characterize for each possible sequence of first-order quantifiers how difficult the described problem can be. We transfer this line of inquiry to the parameterized setting, where the size of the set quantified by the second-order quantifier is the parameter. Many natural parameterized problems can be described in this way using simple sequences of first-order quantifiers: For the clique or vertex cover problems, two universal first-order quantifiers suffice ("for all pairs of vertices ... must hold"); for the dominating set problem, a universal followed by an existential quantifier suffice ("for all vertices, there is a vertex such that ..."); and so on. We present a complete characterization that states for each possible sequence of first-order quantifiers how high the parameterized complexity of the described problems can be. The uncovered dividing line between quantifier sequences that lead to tractable versus intractable problems is distinct from that known from the classical setting, and it depends on whether the parameter is a lower bound on, an upper bound on, or equal to the size of the quantified set.

 On the Complexity of Finding a Sparse Connected Spanning Subgraph in a Non-Uniform Failure Model   
 Authors:  Matthias Bentert, Jannik Schestag, and Frank Sommer  
  Abstract    
 We study a generalization of the classic Spanning Tree problem that allows for a non-uniform failure model. More precisely, edges are either safe or unsafe and we assume that failures only affect unsafe edges. In Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity we are given an undirected graph G = (V,E) in which the edge set E is partitioned into a set S of safe edges and a set U of unsafe edges and the task is to find a set T of at most k edges such that T - {u} is connected and spans V for any unsafe edge u ∈ T. Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity generalizes both Spanning Tree and Hamiltonian Cycle. We study Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity in terms of fixed-parameter tractability (FPT). We show an almost complete dichotomy on which parameters lead to fixed-parameter tractability and which lead to hardness. To this end, we obtain FPT-time algorithms with respect to the vertex deletion distance to cluster graphs and with respect to the treewidth. By exploiting the close relationship to Hamiltonian Cycle, we show that FPT-time algorithms for many smaller parameters are unlikely under standard parameterized complexity assumptions. Regarding problem-specific parameters, we observe that Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity admits an FPT-time algorithm when parameterized by the number of unsafe edges. Furthermore, we investigate a below-upper-bound parameter for the number of edges of a solution. We show that this parameter also leads to an FPT-time algorithm.

 Difference Determines the Degree: Structural Kernelizations of Component Order Connectivity   
 Authors:  Sriram Bhyravarapu, Satyabrata Jana, Saket Saurabh, and Roohani Sharma  
  Abstract    
 We consider the question of polynomial kernelization of a generalization of the classical Vertex Cover problem parameterized by a parameter that is provably smaller than the solution size. In particular, we focus on the c-Component Order Connectivity problem (c-COC) where given an undirected graph G and a non-negative integer t, the objective is to test whether there exists a set S of size at most t such that every component of G-S contains at most c vertices. Such a set S is called a c-coc set. It is known that c-COC admits a kernel with {O}(ct) vertices. Observe that for c = 1, this corresponds to the Vertex Cover problem. We study the c-Component Order Connectivity problem parameterized by the size of a d-coc set (c-COC/d-COC), where c,d ∈ ℕ with c ≤ d. In particular, the input is an undirected graph G, a positive integer t and a set M of at most k vertices of G, such that the size of each connected component in G - M is at most d. The question is to find a set S of vertices of size at most t, such that the size of each connected component in G - S is at most c. In this paper, we give a kernel for c-COC/d-COC with O(k^{d-c+1}) vertices and O(k^{d-c+2}) edges. Our result exhibits that the difference in d and c, and not their absolute values, determines the exact degree of the polynomial in the kernel size. When c = d = 1, the c-COC/d-COC problem is exactly the Vertex Cover problem parameterized by the solution size, which has a kernel with O(k) vertices and O(k²) edges, and this is asymptotically tight [Dell & Melkebeek, JACM 2014]. We also show that the dependence of d-c in the exponent of the kernel size cannot be avoided under reasonable complexity assumptions.

 The Parameterised Complexity Of Integer Multicommodity Flow   
 Authors:  Hans L. Bodlaender, Isja Mannens, Jelle J. Oostveen, Sukanya Pandey, and Erik Jan van Leeuwen  
  Abstract    
 The Integer Multicommodity Flow problem has been studied extensively in the literature. However, from a parameterised perspective, mostly special cases, such as the Disjoint Path problem, have been considered. Therefore, we investigate the parameterised complexity of the general Integer Multicommodity Flow problem. We show that the decision version of this problem on directed graphs for a constant number of commodities, when the capacities are given in unary, is XNLP-complete with pathwidth as parameter and XALP-complete with treewidth as parameter. When the capacities are given in binary, the problem is NP-complete even for graphs of pathwidth at most 13. We give related results for undirected graphs. These results imply that the problem is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable by these parameters. In contrast, we show that the problem does become fixed-parameter tractable when weighted tree partition width (a variant of tree partition width for edge weighted graphs) is used as parameter.

 Treewidth Is NP-Complete on Cubic Graphs   
 Authors:  Hans L. Bodlaender, Édouard Bonnet, Lars Jaffke, Dušan Knop, Paloma T. Lima, Martin Milanič, Sebastian Ordyniak, Sukanya Pandey, and Ondřej Suchý  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we show that Treewidth is NP-complete for cubic graphs, thereby improving the result by Bodlaender and Thilikos from 1997 that Treewidth is NP-complete on graphs with maximum degree at most 9. We add a new and simpler proof of the NP-completeness of treewidth, and show that Treewidth remains NP-complete on subcubic induced subgraphs of the infinite 3-dimensional grid.

 Stretch-Width   
 Authors:  Édouard Bonnet and Julien Duron  
  Abstract    
 We introduce a new parameter, called stretch-width, that we show sits strictly between clique-width and twin-width. Unlike the reduced parameters [BKW '22], planar graphs and polynomial subdivisions do not have bounded stretch-width. This leaves open the possibility of efficient algorithms for a broad fragment of problems within Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic on graphs of bounded stretch-width. In this direction, we prove that graphs of bounded maximum degree and bounded stretch-width have at most logarithmic treewidth. As a consequence, in classes of bounded stretch-width, Maximum Independent Set can be solved in subexponential time 2^{Õ(n^{8/9})} on n-vertex graphs, and, if further the maximum degree is bounded, Existential Counting Modal Logic [Pilipczuk '11] can be model-checked in polynomial time. We also give a polynomial-time O(OPT²)-approximation for the stretch-width of symmetric 0,1-matrices or ordered graphs. Somewhat unexpectedly, we prove that exponential subdivisions of bounded-degree graphs have bounded stretch-width. This allows to complement the logarithmic upper bound of treewidth with a matching lower bound. We leave as open the existence of an efficient approximation algorithm for the stretch-width of unordered graphs, if the exponential subdivisions of all graphs have bounded stretch-width, and if graphs of bounded stretch-width have logarithmic clique-width (or rank-width).

 Minimum Separator Reconfiguration   
 Authors:  Guilherme C. M. Gomes, Clément Legrand-Duchesne, Reem Mahmoud, Amer E. Mouawad, Yoshio Okamoto, Vinicius F. dos Santos, and Tom C. van der Zanden  
  Abstract    
 We study the problem of reconfiguring one minimum s-t-separator A into another minimum s-t-separator B in some n-vertex graph G containing two non-adjacent vertices s and t. We consider several variants of the problem as we focus on both the token sliding and token jumping models. Our first contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes (if one exists) a minimum-length sequence of slides transforming A into B. We additionally establish that the existence of a sequence of jumps (which need not be of minimum length) can be decided in polynomial time (by an algorithm that also outputs a witnessing sequence when one exists). In contrast, and somewhat surprisingly, we show that deciding if a sequence of at most 𝓁 jumps can transform A into B is an NP-complete problem. To complement this negative result, we investigate the parameterized complexity of what we believe to be the two most natural parameterized counterparts of the latter problem; in particular, we study the problem of computing a minimum-length sequence of jumps when parameterized by the size k of the minimum s-t-separators and when parameterized by the number 𝓁 of jumps. For the first parameterization, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable, but does not admit a polynomial kernel unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly. We complete the picture by designing a kernel with 𝒪(𝓁²) vertices and edges for the length 𝓁 of the sequence as a parameter.

 Kernels for the Disjoint Paths Problem on Subclasses of Chordal Graphs   
 Authors:  Juhi Chaudhary, Harmender Gahlawat, Michal Włodarczyk, and Meirav Zehavi  
  Abstract    
 Given an undirected graph G and a multiset of k terminal pairs 𝒳, the Vertex-Disjoint Paths (VDP) and Edge-Disjoint Paths (EDP) problems ask whether G has k pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths and k pairwise edge-disjoint paths, respectively, connecting every terminal pair in 𝒳. In this paper, we study the kernelization complexity of VDP and EDP on subclasses of chordal graphs. For VDP, we design a 4k vertex kernel on split graphs and an 𝒪(k²) vertex kernel on well-partitioned chordal graphs. We also show that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable on threshold graphs. For EDP, we first prove that the problem is NP-complete on complete graphs. Then, we design an 𝒪(k^{2.75}) vertex kernel for EDP on split graphs, and improve it to a 7k+1 vertex kernel on threshold graphs. Lastly, we provide an 𝒪(k²) vertex kernel for EDP on block graphs and a 2k+1 vertex kernel for clique paths. Our contributions improve upon several results in the literature, as well as resolve an open question by Heggernes et al. [Theory Comput. Syst., 2015].

 Parameterized Complexity Classification for Interval Constraints   
 Authors:  Konrad K. Dabrowski, Peter Jonsson, Sebastian Ordyniak, George Osipov, Marcin Pilipczuk, and Roohani Sharma  
  Abstract    
 Constraint satisfaction problems form a nicely behaved class of problems that lends itself to complexity classification results. From the point of view of parameterized complexity, a natural task is to classify the parameterized complexity of MinCSP problems parameterized by the number of unsatisfied constraints. In other words, we ask whether we can delete at most k constraints, where k is the parameter, to get a satisfiable instance. In this work, we take a step towards classifying the parameterized complexity for an important infinite-domain CSP: Allen’s interval algebra (IA). This CSP has closed intervals with rational endpoints as domain values and employs a set A of 13 basic comparison relations such as "precedes" or "during" for relating intervals. IA is a highly influential and well-studied formalism within AI and qualitative reasoning that has numerous applications in, for instance, planning, natural language processing and molecular biology. We provide an FPT vs. W[1]-hard dichotomy for MinCSP(Γ) for all Γ ⊆ A. IA is sometimes extended with unions of the relations in A or first-order definable relations over A, but extending our results to these cases would require first solving the parameterized complexity of Directed Symmetric Multicut, which is a notorious open problem. Already in this limited setting, we uncover connections to new variants of graph cut and separation problems. This includes hardness proofs for simultaneous cuts or feedback arc set problems in directed graphs, as well as new tractable cases with algorithms based on the recently introduced flow augmentation technique. Given the intractability of MinCSP(A) in general, we then consider (parameterized) approximation algorithms. We first show that MinCSP(A) cannot be polynomial-time approximated within any constant factor and continue by presenting a factor-2 fpt-approximation algorithm. Once again, this algorithm has its roots in flow augmentation.

 An FPT Algorithm for Temporal Graph Untangling   
 Authors:  Riccardo Dondi and Manuel Lafond  
  Abstract    
 Several classical combinatorial problems have been considered and analysed on temporal graphs. Recently, a variant of Vertex Cover on temporal graphs, called MinTimelineCover, has been introduced to summarize timeline activities in social networks. The problem asks to cover every temporal edge while minimizing the total span of the vertices (where the span of a vertex is the length of the timestamp interval it must remain active in). While the problem has been shown to be NP-hard even in very restricted cases, its parameterized complexity has not been fully understood. The problem is known to be in FPT under the span parameter only for graphs with two timestamps, but the parameterized complexity for the general case is open. We settle this open problem by giving an FPT algorithm that is based on a combination of iterative compression and a reduction to the Digraph Pair Cut problem, a powerful problem that has received significant attention recently.

 Budgeted Matroid Maximization: a Parameterized Viewpoint   
 Authors:  Ilan Doron-Arad, Ariel Kulik, and Hadas Shachnai  
  Abstract    
 We study budgeted variants of well known maximization problems with multiple matroid constraints. Given an 𝓁-matchoid ℳ on a ground set E, a profit function p:E → ℝ_{≥ 0}, a cost function c:E → ℝ_{≥ 0}, and a budget B ∈ ℝ_{≥ 0}, the goal is to find in the 𝓁-matchoid a feasible set S of maximum profit p(S) subject to the budget constraint, i.e., c(S) ≤ B. The budgeted 𝓁-matchoid (BM) problem includes as special cases budgeted 𝓁-dimensional matching and budgeted 𝓁-matroid intersection. A strong motivation for studying BM from parameterized viewpoint comes from the APX-hardness of unbudgeted 𝓁-dimensional matching (i.e., B = ∞) already for 𝓁 = 3. Nevertheless, while there are known FPT algorithms for the unbudgeted variants of the above problems, the budgeted variants are studied here for the first time through the lens of parameterized complexity. We show that BM parametrized by solution size is W[1]-hard, already with a degenerate single matroid constraint. Thus, an exact parameterized algorithm is unlikely to exist, motivating the study of FPT-approximation schemes (FPAS). Our main result is an FPAS for BM (implying an FPAS for 𝓁-dimensional matching and budgeted 𝓁-matroid intersection), relying on the notion of representative set - a small cardinality subset of elements which preserves the optimum up to a small factor. We also give a lower bound on the minimum possible size of a representative set which can be computed in polynomial time.

 Computing Complexity Measures of Degenerate Graphs   
 Authors:  Pål Grønås Drange, Patrick Greaves, Irene Muzi, and Felix Reidl  
  Abstract    
 We show that the VC-dimension of a graph can be computed in time n^{⌈log d+1⌉} d^{O(d)}, where d is the degeneracy of the input graph. The core idea of our algorithm is a data structure to efficiently query the number of vertices that see a specific subset of vertices inside of a (small) query set. The construction of this data structure takes time O(d2^dn), afterwards queries can be computed efficiently using fast Möbius inversion. This data structure turns out to be useful for a range of tasks, especially for finding bipartite patterns in degenerate graphs, and we outline an efficient algorithm for counting the number of times specific patterns occur in a graph. The largest factor in the running time of this algorithm is O(n^c), where c is a parameter of the pattern we call its left covering number. Concrete applications of this algorithm include counting the number of (non-induced) bicliques in linear time, the number of co-matchings in quadratic time, as well as a constant-factor approximation of the ladder index in linear time. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with several implementations and run experiments on more than 200 real-world datasets - the largest of which has 8 million edges - where we obtain interesting insights into the VC-dimension of real-world networks.

 An Improved Kernelization Algorithm for Trivially Perfect Editing   
 Authors:  Maël Dumas and Anthony Perez  
  Abstract    
 In the Trivially Perfect Editing problem one is given an undirected graph G = (V,E) and an integer k and seeks to add or delete at most k edges in G to obtain a trivially perfect graph. In a recent work, Dumas et al. [Dumas et al., 2023] proved that this problem admits a kernel with O(k³) vertices. This result heavily relies on the fact that the size of trivially perfect modules can be bounded by O(k²) as shown by Drange and Pilipczuk [Drange and Pilipczuk, 2018]. To obtain their cubic vertex-kernel, Dumas et al. [Dumas et al., 2023] then showed that a more intricate structure, so-called comb, can be reduced to O(k²) vertices. In this work we show that the bound can be improved to O(k) for both aforementioned structures and thus obtain a kernel with O(k²) vertices. Our approach relies on the straightforward yet powerful observation that any large enough structure contains unaffected vertices whose neighborhood remains unchanged by an editing of size k, implying strong structural properties.

 From Data Completion to Problems on Hypercubes: A Parameterized Analysis of the Independent Set Problem   
 Authors:  Eduard Eiben, Robert Ganian, Iyad Kanj, Sebastian Ordyniak, and Stefan Szeider  
  Abstract    
 Several works have recently investigated the parameterized complexity of data completion problems, motivated by their applications in machine learning, and clustering in particular. Interestingly, these problems can be equivalently formulated as classical graph problems on induced subgraphs of powers of partially-defined hypercubes. In this paper, we follow up on this recent direction by investigating the Independent Set problem on this graph class, which has been studied in the data science setting under the name Diversity. We obtain a comprehensive picture of the problem’s parameterized complexity and establish its fixed-parameter tractability w.r.t. the solution size plus the power of the hypercube. Given that several such FO-definable problems have been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable on the considered graph class, one may ask whether fixed-parameter tractability could be extended to capture all FO-definable problems. We answer this question in the negative by showing that FO model checking on induced subgraphs of hypercubes is as difficult as FO model checking on general graphs.

 Approximate Monotone Local Search for Weighted Problems   
 Authors:  Barış Can Esmer, Ariel Kulik, Dániel Marx, Daniel Neuen, and Roohani Sharma  
  Abstract    
 In a recent work, Esmer et al. describe a simple method - Approximate Monotone Local Search - to obtain exponential approximation algorithms from existing parameterized exact algorithms, polynomial-time approximation algorithms and, more generally, parameterized approximation algorithms. In this work, we generalize those results to the weighted setting. More formally, we consider monotone subset minimization problems over a weighted universe of size n (e.g., Vertex Cover, d-Hitting Set and Feedback Vertex Set). We consider a model where the algorithm is only given access to a subroutine that finds a solution of weight at most α ⋅ W (and of arbitrary cardinality) in time c^k ⋅ n^{𝒪(1)} where W is the minimum weight of a solution of cardinality at most k. In the unweighted setting, Esmer et al. determine the smallest value d for which a β-approximation algorithm running in time dⁿ ⋅ n^{𝒪(1)} can be obtained in this model. We show that the same dependencies also hold in a weighted setting in this model: for every fixed ε > 0 we obtain a β-approximation algorithm running in time 𝒪((d+ε)ⁿ), for the same d as in the unweighted setting. Similarly, we also extend a β-approximate brute-force search (in a model which only provides access to a membership oracle) to the weighted setting. Using existing approximation algorithms and exact parameterized algorithms for weighted problems, we obtain the first exponential-time β-approximation algorithms that are better than brute force for a variety of problems including Weighted Vertex Cover, Weighted d-Hitting Set, Weighted Feedback Vertex Set and Weighted Multicut.

 Consistency Checking Problems: A Gateway to Parameterized Sample Complexity   
 Authors:  Robert Ganian, Liana Khazaliya, and Kirill Simonov  
  Abstract    
 Recently, Brand, Ganian and Simonov introduced a parameterized refinement of the classical PAC-learning sample complexity framework. A crucial outcome of their investigation is that for a very wide range of learning problems, there is a direct and provable correspondence between fixed-parameter PAC-learnability (in the sample complexity setting) and the fixed-parameter tractability of a corresponding "consistency checking" search problem (in the setting of computational complexity). The latter can be seen as generalizations of classical search problems where instead of receiving a single instance, one receives multiple yes- and no-examples and is tasked with finding a solution which is consistent with the provided examples. Apart from a few initial results, consistency checking problems are almost entirely unexplored from a parameterized complexity perspective. In this article, we provide an overview of these problems and their connection to parameterized sample complexity, with the primary aim of facilitating further research in this direction. Afterwards, we establish the fixed-parameter (in)-tractability for some of the arguably most natural consistency checking problems on graphs, and show that their complexity-theoretic behavior is surprisingly very different from that of classical decision problems. Our new results cover consistency checking variants of problems as diverse as (k-)Path, Matching, 2-Coloring, Independent Set and Dominating Set, among others.

 Finding Degree-Constrained Acyclic Orientations   
 Authors:  Jaroslav Garvardt, Malte Renken, Jannik Schestag, and Mathias Weller  
  Abstract    
 We consider the problem of orienting a given, undirected graph into a (directed) acyclic graph such that the in-degree of each vertex v is in a prescribed list λ(v). Variants of this problem have been studied for a long time and with various applications, but mostly without the requirement for acyclicity. Without this requirement, the problem is closely related to the classical General Factor problem, which is known to be NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if no list λ(v) contains large "gaps" [Cornuéjols, J. Comb. Theory B, 1988]. In contrast, we show that deciding if an acyclic orientation exists is NP-hard even in the absence of such "gaps". On the positive side, we design parameterized algorithms for various, natural parameterizations of the acyclic orientation problem. A special case of the orientation problem with degree constraints recently came up in the context of reconstructing evolutionary histories (that is, phylogenetic networks). This phylogenetic setting imposes additional structure onto the problem that can be exploited algorithmically, allowing us to show fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by either the treewidth of G (a smaller parameter than the frequently employed "level"), by the number of vertices v for which |λ(v)| ≥ 2, by the number of vertices v for which the highest value in λ(v) is at least 2. While the latter result can be extended to the general degree-constraint acyclic orientation problem, we show that the former cannot unless FPT=W[1].

 Graph Clustering Problems Under the Lens of Parameterized Local Search   
 Authors:  Jaroslav Garvardt, Nils Morawietz, André Nichterlein, and Mathias Weller  
  Abstract    
 Cluster Editing is the problem of finding the minimum number of edge-modifications that transform a given graph G into a cluster graph G', that is, each connected component of G' is a clique. Similarly, in the Cluster Deletion problem, we further restrict the sought cluster graph G' to contain only edges that are also present in G. In this work, we consider the parameterized complexity of a local search variant for both problems: LS Cluster Deletion and LS Cluster Editing. Herein, the input also comprises an integer k and a partition 𝒞 of the vertex set of G that describes an initial cluster graph G^*, and we are to decide whether the "k-move-neighborhood" of G^* contains a cluster graph G' that is "better" (uses less modifications) than G^*. Roughly speaking, two cluster graphs G₁ and G₂ are k-move-neighbors if G₁ can be obtained from G₂ by moving at most k vertices to different connected components. We consider parameterizations by k + 𝓁 for some natural parameters 𝓁, such as the number of clusters in 𝒞, the size of a largest cluster in 𝒞, or the cluster-vertex-deletion number (cvd) of G. Our main lower-bound results are that LS Cluster Editing is W[1]-hard when parameterized by k even if 𝒞 has size two and that both LS Cluster Deletion and LS Cluster Editing are W[1]-hard when parameterized by k + 𝓁, where 𝓁 is the size of the largest cluster of 𝒞. On the positive side, we show that both problems admit an algorithm that runs in k^{𝒪(k)}⋅ cvd^{3k} ⋅ n^{𝒪(1)} time and either finds a better cluster graph or correctly outputs that there is no better cluster graph in the k-move-neighborhood of the initial cluster graph. As an intermediate result, we also obtain an algorithm that solves Cluster Deletion in cvd^{cvd} ⋅ n^{𝒪(1)} time.

 Bandwidth Parameterized by Cluster Vertex Deletion Number   
 Authors:  Tatsuya Gima, Eun Jung Kim, Noleen Köhler, Nikolaos Melissinos, and Manolis Vasilakis  
  Abstract    
 Given a graph G and an integer b, Bandwidth asks whether there exists a bijection π from V(G) to {1, …, |V(G)|} such that max_{{u, v} ∈ E(G)} | π(u) - π(v) | ≤ b. This is a classical NP-complete problem, known to remain NP-complete even on very restricted classes of graphs, such as trees of maximum degree 3 and caterpillars of hair length 3. In the realm of parameterized complexity, these results imply that the problem remains NP-hard on graphs of bounded pathwidth, while it is additionally known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treedepth of the input graph. In contrast, the problem does become FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number of the input graph. In this paper, we make progress towards the parameterized (in)tractability of Bandwidth. We first show that it is FPT when parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number cvd plus the clique number ω of the input graph, thus generalizing the previously mentioned result for vertex cover. On the other hand, we show that Bandwidth is W[1]-hard when parameterized only by cvd. Our results generalize some of the previous results and narrow some of the complexity gaps.

 Collective Graph Exploration Parameterized by Vertex Cover   
 Authors:  Siddharth Gupta, Guy Sa'ar, and Meirav Zehavi  
  Abstract    
 We initiate the study of the parameterized complexity of the Collective Graph Exploration (CGE) problem. In CGE, the input consists of an undirected connected graph G and a collection of k robots, initially placed at the same vertex r of G, and each one of them has an energy budget of B. The objective is to decide whether G can be explored by the k robots in B time steps, i.e., there exist k closed walks in G, one corresponding to each robot, such that every edge is covered by at least one walk, every walk starts and ends at the vertex r, and the maximum length of any walk is at most B. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-hard even on trees [Fraigniaud et al., 2006]. Further, we prove that the problem remains W[1]-hard parameterized by k even for trees of treedepth 3. Due to the para-NP-hardness of the problem parameterized by treedepth, and motivated by real-world scenarios, we study the parameterized complexity of the problem parameterized by the vertex cover number (vc) of the graph, and prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by vc. Additionally, we study the optimization version of CGE, where we want to optimize B, and design an approximation algorithm with an additive approximation factor of O(vc).

 Drawn Tree Decomposition: New Approach for Graph Drawing Problems   
 Authors:  Siddharth Gupta, Guy Sa'ar, and Meirav Zehavi  
  Abstract    
 Over the past decade, we witness an increasing amount of interest in the design of exact exponential-time and parameterized algorithms for problems in Graph Drawing. Unfortunately, we still lack knowledge of general methods to develop such algorithms. An even more serious issue is that, here, "standard" parameters very often yield intractability. In particular, for the most common structural parameter, namely, treewidth, we frequently observe NP-hardness already when the input graphs are restricted to have constant (often, being just 1 or 2) treewidth. Our work deals with both drawbacks simultaneously. We introduce a novel form of tree decomposition that, roughly speaking, does not decompose (only) a graph, but an entire drawing. As such, its bags and separators are of geometric (rather than only combinatorial) nature. While the corresponding parameter - like treewidth - can be arbitrarily smaller than the height (and width) of the drawing, we show that - unlike treewidth - it gives rise to efficient algorithms. Specifically, we get slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithms parameterized by our parameter. We present a general scheme for the design of such algorithms, and apply it to several central problems in Graph Drawing, including the recognition of grid graphs, minimization of crossings and bends, and compaction. Other than for the class of problems we discussed in the paper, we believe that our decomposition and scheme are of independent interest and can be further extended or generalized to suit even a wider class of problems. Additionally, we discuss classes of drawings where our parameter is bounded by 𝒪(√n) (where n is the number of vertices of the graph), yielding subexponential-time algorithms. Lastly, we prove which relations exist between drawn treewidth and other width measures, including treewidth, pathwidth, (dual) carving-width and embedded-width.

 Single Machine Scheduling with Few Deadlines   
 Authors:  Klaus Heeger, Danny Hermelin, and Dvir Shabtay  
  Abstract    
 We study single-machine scheduling problems with few deadlines. We focus on two classical objectives, namely minimizing the weighted number of tardy jobs and the total weighted completion time. For both problems, we give a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for a constant number of different deadlines. This algorithm is complemented with an ETH-based, almost tight lower bound. Furthermore, we study the case where the number of jobs with a nontrivial deadline is taken as parameter. For this case, the complexity of our two problems differ: Minimizing the total number of tardy jobs becomes fixed-parameter tractable, while minimizing the total weighted completion time is W[1]-hard.

 Twin-Width of Graphs with Tree-Structured Decompositions   
 Authors:  Irene Heinrich and Simon Raßmann  
  Abstract    
 The twin-width of a graph measures its distance to co-graphs and generalizes classical width concepts such as tree-width or rank-width. Since its introduction in 2020 [Édouard Bonnet et al., 2022; Édouard Bonnet et al., 2020], a mass of new results has appeared relating twin width to group theory, model theory, combinatorial optimization, and structural graph theory. We take a detailed look at the interplay between the twin-width of a graph and the twin-width of its components under tree-structured decompositions: We prove that the twin-width of a graph is at most twice its strong tree-width, contrasting nicely with the result of [Édouard Bonnet and Hugues Déprés, 2023; Édouard Bonnet and Hugues Déprés, 2022], which states that twin-width can be exponential in tree-width. Further, we employ the fundamental concept from structural graph theory of decomposing a graph into highly connected components, in order to obtain optimal linear bounds on the twin-width of a graph given the widths of its biconnected components. For triconnected components we obtain a linear upper bound if we add red edges to the components indicating the splits which led to the components. Extending this approach to quasi-4-connectivity, we obtain a quadratic upper bound. Finally, we investigate how the adhesion of a tree decomposition influences the twin-width of the decomposed graph.

 Dynamic Programming on Bipartite Tree Decompositions   
 Authors:  Lars Jaffke, Laure Morelle, Ignasi Sau, and Dimitrios M. Thilikos  
  Abstract    
 We revisit a graph width parameter that we dub bipartite treewidth, along with its associated graph decomposition that we call bipartite tree decomposition. Bipartite treewidth can be seen as a common generalization of treewidth and the odd cycle transversal number. Intuitively, a bipartite tree decomposition is a tree decomposition whose bags induce almost bipartite graphs and whose adhesions contain at most one vertex from the bipartite part of any other bag, while the width of such decomposition measures how far the bags are from being bipartite. Adapted from a tree decomposition originally defined by Demaine, Hajiaghayi, and Kawarabayashi [SODA 2010] and explicitly defined by Tazari [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2012], bipartite treewidth appears to play a crucial role for solving problems related to odd-minors, which have recently attracted considerable attention. As a first step toward a theory for solving these problems efficiently, the main goal of this paper is to develop dynamic programming techniques to solve problems on graphs of small bipartite treewidth. For such graphs, we provide a number of para-NP-completeness results, FPT-algorithms, and XP-algorithms, as well as several open problems. In particular, we show that K_t-Subgraph-Cover, Weighted Vertex Cover/Independent Set, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Maximum Weighted Cut are FPT parameterized by bipartite treewidth. We also provide the following complexity dichotomy when H is a 2-connected graph, for each of the H-Subgraph-Packing, H-Induced-Packing, H-Scattered-Packing, and H-Odd-Minor-Packing problems: if H is bipartite, then the problem is para-NP-complete parameterized by bipartite treewidth while, if H is non-bipartite, then the problem is solvable in XP-time. Beyond bipartite treewidth, we define 1-ℋ-treewidth by replacing the bipartite graph class by any graph class ℋ. Most of the technology developed here also works for this more general parameter.

 Kernelization for Counting Problems on Graphs: Preserving the Number of Minimum Solutions   
 Authors:  Bart M. P. Jansen and Bart van der Steenhoven  
  Abstract    
 A kernelization for a parameterized decision problem 𝒬 is a polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm that reduces any parameterized instance (x,k) into an instance (x',k') whose size is bounded by a function of k alone and which has the same yes/no answer for 𝒬. Such preprocessing algorithms cannot exist in the context of counting problems, when the answer to be preserved is the number of solutions, since this number can be arbitrarily large compared to k. However, we show that for counting minimum feedback vertex sets of size at most k, and for counting minimum dominating sets of size at most k in a planar graph, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that either outputs the answer or reduces to an instance (G',k') of size polynomial in k with the same number of minimum solutions. This shows that a meaningful theory of kernelization for counting problems is possible and opens the door for future developments. Our algorithms exploit that if the number of solutions exceeds 2^{poly(k)}, the size of the input is exponential in terms of k so that the running time of a parameterized counting algorithm can be bounded by poly(n). Otherwise, we can use gadgets that slightly increase k to represent choices among 2^{𝒪(k)} options by only poly(k) vertices.

 On the Parameterized Complexity of Multiway Near-Separator   
 Authors:  Bart M. P. Jansen and Shivesh K. Roy  
  Abstract    
 We study a new graph separation problem called Multiway Near-Separator. Given an undirected graph G, integer k, and terminal set T ⊆ V(G), it asks whether there is a vertex set S ⊆ V(G) ⧵ T of size at most k such that in graph G-S, no pair of distinct terminals can be connected by two pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths. Hence each terminal pair can be separated in G-S by removing at most one vertex. The problem is therefore a generalization of (Node) Multiway Cut, which asks for a vertex set for which each terminal is in a different component of G-S. We develop a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for Multiway Near-Separator running in time 2^{𝒪(k log k)} ⋅ n^{𝒪(1)}. Our algorithm is based on a new pushing lemma for solutions with respect to important separators, along with two problem-specific ingredients. The first is a polynomial-time subroutine to reduce the number of terminals in the instance to a polynomial in the solution size k plus the size of a given suboptimal solution. The second is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a graph G and terminal set T ⊆ V(G) along with a single vertex x ∈ V(G) that forms a multiway near-separator, computes a 14-approximation for the problem of finding a multiway near-separator not containing x.

 Sunflowers Meet Sparsity: A Linear-Vertex Kernel for Weighted Clique-Packing on Sparse Graphs   
 Authors:  Bart M. P. Jansen and Shivesh K. Roy  
  Abstract    
 We study the kernelization complexity of the Weighted H-Packing problem on sparse graphs. For a fixed connected graph H, in the Weighted H-Packing problem the input is a graph G, a vertex-weight function w : V(G) → ℕ, and positive integers k, t. The question is whether there exist k vertex-disjoint subgraphs H₁, …, H_k of G such that H_i is isomorphic to H for each i ∈ [k] and the total weight of these k ⋅ |V(H)| vertices is at least t. It is known that the (unweighted) H-Packing problem admits a kernel with 𝒪(k^{|V(H)|-1}) vertices on general graphs, and a linear kernel on planar graphs and graphs of bounded genus. In this work, we focus on case that H is a clique on h ≥ 3 vertices (which captures Triangle Packing) and present a linear-vertex kernel for Weighted K_h-Packing on graphs of bounded expansion, along with a kernel with 𝒪(k^{1+ε}) vertices on nowhere-dense graphs for all ε > 0. To obtain these results, we combine two powerful ingredients in a novel way: the Erdős-Rado Sunflower lemma and the theory of sparsity.

 How Can We Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity? Parameterized Approaches for Networks   
 Authors:  Mark Jones and Jannik Schestag  
  Abstract    
 Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) is a measure of the overall biodiversity of a set of present-day species (taxa) within a phylogenetic tree. We consider an extension of PD to phylogenetic networks. Given a phylogenetic network with weighted edges and a subset S of leaves, the all-paths phylogenetic diversity of S is the summed weight of all edges on a path from the root to some leaf in S. The problem of finding a bounded-size set S that maximizes this measure is polynomial-time solvable on trees, but NP-hard on networks. We study the latter from a parameterized perspective. While this problem is W[2]-hard with respect to the size of S (and W[1]-hard with respect to the size of the complement of S), we show that it is FPT with respect to several other parameters, including the phylogenetic diversity of S, the acceptable loss of phylogenetic diversity, the number of reticulations in the network, and the treewidth of the underlying graph.

 Sidestepping Barriers for Dominating Set in Parameterized Complexity   
 Authors:  Ioannis Koutis, Michał Włodarczyk, and Meirav Zehavi  
  Abstract    
 We study the classic Dominating Set problem with respect to several prominent parameters. Specifically, we present algorithmic results that sidestep time complexity barriers by the incorporation of either approximation or larger parameterization. Our results span several parameterization regimes, including: (i,ii,iii) time/ratio-tradeoff for the parameters treewidth, vertex modulator to constant treewidth and solution size; (iv,v) FPT-algorithms for the parameters vertex cover number and feedback edge set number; and (vi) compression for the parameter feedback edge set number.

 Approximate Turing Kernelization and Lower Bounds for Domination Problems   
 Authors:  Stefan Kratsch and Pascal Kunz  
  Abstract    
 An α-approximate polynomial Turing kernelization is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an (α c)-approximate solution for a parameterized optimization problem when given access to an oracle that can compute c-approximate solutions to instances with size bounded by a polynomial in the parameter. Hols et al. [ESA 2020] showed that a wide array of graph problems admit a (1+ε)-approximate polynomial Turing kernelization when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph and left open whether Dominating Set also admits such a kernelization. We show that Dominating Set and several related problems parameterized by treewidth do not admit constant-factor approximate polynomial Turing kernelizations, even with respect to the much larger parameter vertex cover number, under certain reasonable complexity assumptions. On the positive side, we show that all of them do have a (1+ε)-approximate polynomial Turing kernelization for every ε > 0 for the joint parameterization by treewidth and maximum degree, a parameter which generalizes cutwidth, for example.

 A Parameterized Approximation Scheme for the Geometric Knapsack Problem with Wide Items   
 Authors:  Mathieu Mari, Timothé Picavet, and Michał Pilipczuk  
  Abstract    
 We study a natural geometric variant of the classic Knapsack problem called 2D-Knapsack: we are given a set of axis-parallel rectangles and a rectangular bounding box, and the goal is to pack as many of these rectangles inside the box without overlap. Naturally, this problem is NP-complete. Recently, Grandoni et al. [ESA'19] showed that it is also 𝖶[1]-hard when parameterized by the size k of the sought packing, and they presented a parameterized approximation scheme (PAS) for the variant where we are allowed to rotate the rectangles by 90° before packing them into the box. Obtaining a PAS for the original 2D-Knapsack problem, without rotation, appears to be a challenging open question. In this work, we make progress towards this goal by showing a PAS under the following assumptions: - both the box and all the input rectangles have integral, polynomially bounded sidelengths; - every input rectangle is wide - its width is greater than its height; and - the aspect ratio of the box is bounded by a constant. Our approximation scheme relies on a mix of various parameterized and approximation techniques, including color coding, rounding, and searching for a structured near-optimum packing using dynamic programming.

 A Contraction-Recursive Algorithm for Treewidth   
 Authors:  Hisao Tamaki  
  Abstract    
 Let tw(G) denote the treewidth of graph G. Given a graph G and a positive integer k such that tw(G) ≤ k + 1, we are to decide if tw(G) ≤ k. We give a certifying algorithm RTW ("R" for recursive) for this task: it returns one or more tree-decompositions of G of width ≤ k if the answer is YES and a minimal contraction H of G such that tw(H) > k otherwise. Starting from a greedy upper bound on tw(G) and repeatedly improving the upper bound by this algorithm, we obtain tw(G) with certificates. RTW uses a heuristic variant of Tamaki’s PID algorithm for treewidth (ESA2017), which we call HPID. Informally speaking, PID builds potential subtrees of tree-decompositions of width ≤ k in a bottom up manner, until such a tree-decomposition is constructed or the set of potential subtrees is exhausted without success. HPID uses the same method of generating a new subtree from existing ones but with a different generation order which is not intended for exhaustion but for quick generation of a full tree-decomposition when possible. RTW, given G and k, interleaves the execution of HPID with recursive calls on G /e for edges e of G, where G / e denotes the graph obtained from G by contracting edge e. If we find that tw(G / e) > k, then we have tw(G) > k with the same certificate. If we find that tw(G / e) ≤ k, we "uncontract" the bags of the certifying tree-decompositions of G / e into bags of G and feed them to HPID to help progress. If the question is not resolved after the recursive calls are made for all edges, we finish HPID in an exhaustive mode. If it turns out that tw(G) > k, then G is a certificate for tw(G') > k for every G' of which G is a contraction, because we have found tw(G / e) ≤ k for every edge e of G. This final round of HPID guarantees the correctness of the algorithm, while its practical efficiency derives from our methods of "uncontracting" bags of tree-decompositions of G / e to useful bags of G, as well as of exploiting those bags in HPID. Experiments show that our algorithm drastically extends the scope of practically solvable instances. In particular, when applied to the 100 instances in the PACE 2017 bonus set, the number of instances solved by our implementation on a typical laptop, with the timeout of 100, 1000, and 10000 seconds per instance, are 72, 92, and 98 respectively, while these numbers are 11, 38, and 68 for Tamaki’s PID solver and 65, 82, and 85 for his new solver (SEA 2022).

 PACE Solver Description: The PACE 2023 Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge: Twinwidth   
 Authors:  Max Bannach and Sebastian Berndt  
  Abstract    
 This article is a report by the challenge organizers on the 8th Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE 2023). As was common in previous iterations of the competition, this year’s iteration implemented an exact and heuristic track for a parameterized problem that has gained attention in the theory community. This year, the problem was to compute the twinwidth of a graph, a recently introduced width parameter that measures the similarity of a graph to a cograph. In the exact track, the competition participants were asked to develop an exact algorithm that can solve as many instances as possible from a benchmark set of 100 instances - with a time limit of 30 minutes per instance. The same task must be accomplished within 5 minutes in the heuristic track. However, the result in this track is not required to be optimal. As in previous iterations, the organizers handed out awards to the best solutions in both tracks and to the best student submissions. New this year is a dedicated theory award that appreciates new theoretical insights found by the participants during the development of their tools.

 PACE Solver Description: Hydra Prime   
 Authors:  Yosuke Mizutani, David Dursteler, and Blair D. Sullivan  
  Abstract    
 This note describes our submission to the 2023 PACE Challenge on the computation of twin-width. Our solver Hydra Prime combines modular decomposition with a collection of upper- and lower-bound algorithms, which are alternatingly applied on the prime graphs resulting from the modular decomposition. We introduce two novel approaches which contributed to the solver’s winning performance in the Exact Track: timeline encoding and hydra decomposition. Timeline encoding is a new data structure for computing the width of a given contraction sequence, enabling faster local search; the hydra decomposition is an iterative refinement strategy featuring a small vertex separator.

 PACE Solver Description: Exact (GUTHMI) and Heuristic (GUTHM)   
 Authors:  Alexander Leonhardt, Holger Dell, Anselm Haak, Frank Kammer, Johannes Meintrup, Ulrich Meyer, and Manuel Penschuck  
  Abstract    
 Twin-width (tww) is a parameter measuring the similarity of an undirected graph to a co-graph [Édouard Bonnet et al., 2022]. It is useful to analyze the parameterized complexity of various graph problems. This paper presents two algorithms to compute the twin-width and to provide a contraction sequence as witness. The two algorithms are motivated by the PACE 2023 challenge, one for the exact track and one for the heuristic track. Each algorithm produces a contraction sequence witnessing (i) the minimal twin-width admissible by the graph in the exact track (ii) an upper bound on the twin-width as tight as possible in the heuristic track. Our heuristic algorithm relies on several greedy approaches with different performance characteristics to find and improve solutions. For large graphs we use locality sensitive hashing to approximately identify suitable contraction candidates. The exact solver follows a branch-and-bound design. It relies on the heuristic algorithm to provide initial upper bounds, and uses lower bounds via contraction sequences to show the optimality of a heuristic solution found in some branch.

 PACE Solver Description: Zygosity   
 Authors:  Emmanuel Arrighi, Pål Grønås Drange, Kenneth Langedal, Farhad Vadiee, Martin Vatshelle, and Petra Wolf  
  Abstract    
 The graph parameter twin-width was recently introduced by Bonnet et al. Twin-width is a parameter that measures a graph’s similarity to a cograph, which is a graph that can be reduced to a single vertex by repeatedly contracting twins. This brief description introduces Zygosity, a heuristic for computing a low-width contraction sequence that achieved second place in the 2023 edition of Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE). Zygosity starts by repeatedly contracting twins. Then, any attached trees are contracted down to a single pendant vertex. The remaining graph is then contracted using a randomized greedy algorithm.

  About IEEE IRI  
  Data science has become the new frontier for self-driving cars and AI. Such intelligent applications derive from Information Reuse and Integration  (IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations and ontologies. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it; and, it applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.  
 This conference explores three major tracks: information reuse  , information integration  , and reusable systems  . Information reuse  explores the theory and practice of optimizing representations; information integration  focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel domains; and reusable systems  focus on developing and deploying models and corresponding processes that enable Information Reuse  and Integration  to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains.  
 The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and keynote speeches.

 Paper Submission Deadline: Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST.  
   
 Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers: March 31, 2025.  
   
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025)  , sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory ( SIGACT  ), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23  to Friday, June 27  .  
 Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.  
 Submission format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below)  , and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
   
  Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
   
  STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…").  
   
  The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
   
  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
   
  PC Member Submissions:  Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.  
   
  Recommended Best Practices for References:  Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages.  
   
  Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.  
 Conflict of Interest Policy:  The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here  ) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy  . Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate  affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  
 Submission Instructions:  Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  
 The submission server  is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.   
 It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:  The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.  
 Presentation of Accepted Papers:  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
  
 Dates and other relevant information:  
 Paper submission deadline:  Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.  
   
  Notification date:  by email on or before February 1, 2025.  
   
  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:  A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format  , and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers.  
   
  STOC talks:  Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.  
   
 Publication date:  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best Paper Award:  The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html  .  
 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:  A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html  .  
 Access to Proceedings:  The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025.  
 Student Travel Awards:  SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.

 Emerging Trends in Data Visualization   
 Since the IT industry progresses, new technologies for data visualization appear. They give birth to new trends and approaches for visual analytics.  
 Conferences are usually centered around new technologies and emerging trends. In 2024, AI in data visualization and data storytelling will be popular topics discussed in data visualization conferences.  
 AI in Data Visualization   
 Popular data visualization tools, such as PowerBI and Tableau, implement AI to enrich existing features and add new ones. For instance, Power BI extensively promotes Natural Language Query (NLQ), allowing non-technical users to clearly understand their data. They just need to write a question in simple language and get a response from the AI-based assistant.  
 Another example of the AI implementation in modern data visualization tools is the anomaly detection. This primarily refers to outliers far beyond the usual data range values. Such anomalies significantly impact the results of visual analysis, so they should be detected and removed.  
 AI can also be used in predictive analytics and forecasting. It takes a series of data from different timelines and apps, detects tendencies, and forms patterns. Based on these findings, AI can shape probable scenarios on user behavior, market trends, and other crucial business areas.  
 Interactive and Real-time Data Visualization   
 Instead of creating different dispersed charts, you can consider comprehensive dashboards. You can design them on your own or take pre-configured templates:  
 Tableau dashboard templates 
  Looker Studio dashboard templates 
  That way, you can observe departmental or the overall business performance at a glance. You can even set up the real-time data supply to have the most recent and accurate data at hand. For that, consider data integration tools.  
 Skyvia  is a universal cloud platform designed for a wide range of data-related tasks. It’s suitable for data integration, SaaS backup, and other operations on data.

 Data Storytelling   
 This is the next level of data visualization. It explains complex data in digestive format through infographics or interactive maps combined with descriptive text.  
 Data storytelling is used within business teams as well as for external communications. It helps to discover gaps in business performance and find points for improvement through visuals. At the same time, it can communicate business success to clients and stakeholders.  
 Tips for Making the Most of Data Visualization Conferences   
 Сonferences are usually large-scale events involving hundreds if not thousands of people. Since they include lots of activities, such events are planned long beforehand. You also need to put some effort into preparation before any data visualization conference and think of how you can benefit from it.  
 Planning and Preparation   
 It’s highly recommended that you prepare in advance for the selected data visualization conference. This applies to administrative procedures and subject-oriented preparation.  
 Here are some tips that can be useful for getting ready for a conference:  
 Explore the event website to get details about the location and agenda. 
  See whether you need a visa to enter the country where the conference will take place. 
  Book a flight and make a room reservation for your stay during the conference. 
  Monitor news in the data field, focusing on data visualization topics. 
  Watch the highlights from previous years of the same conference. 
  Make sure you follow the paper submission deadlines if you participate as a speaker at the scientific conference. 
  Networking Strategies   
 Conferences are places where one usually meets new people who can potentially convert into business partners or employees. Communicating with people you hardly know isn’t easy, so it’s a good idea to explore networking tips and use them during an event.  
 Prepare some conversation starters. | Think of some phrases about the common interests that unite the conference members. That could be the event-related subjects, such as topics discussed, data visualization trends, conference location, etc. Also, explore some | ideas for small talk | . 
  Use formal language. | Using formal language in a professional environment is a rule of thumb. 
  Get the list of networking events. | The conference agenda usually includes general breakfast or lunch times as well as table discussions, which are suitable for networking. 
  Prepare a brief presentation of yourself and your projects. | Write down several sentences about your professional experience and interests on paper. 
  Have an exit strategy. | The conversation might go in the wrong direction from your point of view. For instance, people may start discussing topics or projects that don’t interest you. In such cases, have an exit phrase or two in your pocket. For instance, you may say that you need to go to the next workshop or training session. 
  Take business cards with you. | At present, business card exchange is the fastest way to share your business contact details. 
  Visit afterparties. | Such events help people to interact with each other in a less formal environment. This helps to build human-to-human relationships, which adds trust in professional collaboration. 
  Follow up the conversations. | Make sure to add people who interest you on LinkedIn or other social media. That way, you can maintain connections in the future. 
  Note that most networking opportunities are available in the offline mode. So, if you expect to get to know new people, your physical presence at a conference is a must.  
 Post-Conference Follow-Up   
 During data visualization events, you learn a lot of new information. However, it would make no sense if you didn’t put it into practice. When you are back at the office, try the new experiences you gained during the conference. This should better be done in test mode so you’ll know exactly which things work for you and which don’t.  
 Take a look at the video records and other materials available on the conference website. This will help you to refresh the recently gained knowledge and share it with your colleagues.  
 Conclusion   
 Data visualization itself is already a breakthrough phenomenon in the IT industry. It translates complex data into comprehensive dashboards.  
 As the industry evolves, new approaches and trends in data visualization appear. To be the first to discover them, consider attending conferences. Get ready in advance by exploring the data visualization trends and planning your trip.  
 Take advantage of the networking opportunities and experience sharing during the conference. This will help to lead your business ahead of competitors and gain success in the market.

  Abstract:  The last two years literature witnesses an explosion of contributions on agent systems and technologies. It seems that research and development in this field is hype, papers describe systems which are intelligent, mobile, autonomous and/or any other combination of these attributes. Research in this area is already rather old, but the effort in this field grew only in the last years, the years of INTERNET growth and of the telecommunication services.

  Abstract:  Given a process whose output is a dynamic function of time, the traditional discrete event specification (DEVS) approximates the input, output, and state trajectories through piecewise constant segments, where the segments correspond to discrete time intervals that are not necessarily equal in length. For processes that defy accurate modeling through piecewise constant segments, this paper presents GDEVS, a generalized discrete event specification, wherein the trajectories are organized through piecewise polynomial segments. The utilization of arbitrary polynomial functions for segments promises higher accuracies in modeling continuous processes as discrete event abstractions. In general, discrete event systems including DEVS and GDEVS execute faster on host computers because executions occur corresponding to significant changes in the system unlike in continuous simulations where execution is on a continuous basis. GDEVS' superiority over DEVS lies in its ability to discretize a system characteristic. A key contribution of GDEVS is that it permits the development of a uniform simulation environment for hybrid, i.e. both continuous and discrete, systems. GDEVS is illustrated for a first order system and a hybrid system, with piecewise linear segments. Two representative systems have been modeled under GDEVS and executed on a simulator developed for GDEVS.

  Abstract:  Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will enable new applications that increase safety and convenience of the passengers in the car. Most applications for VANETs use information provided by other cars, and road side units. Different complementary means exist to establish a trustworthy and privacy preserving system; they include certification, reputation systems, plausibility checking, and frequently changing pseudonyms. Often, these measures are tailored to specific aspects of the system and cannot easily be used by application developers, nor can they easily be combined. We present an architecture to integrate trust and privacy services for the use in vehicular environments. The main contributions of this paper are (1) an architecture for securing vehicular communications that can easily be used by application developers, (2) the principle of trust tagging including a model for trust establishment for the vehicular domain and (3) the context mix model for preserving location privacy of vehicles

  Abstract:  Web service may be used to construct autonomic business processes, where several Web services interact with each other to carry out complex transactions or workflows. During the execution of an autonomic process, if one component service fails or becomes overloaded, a mechanism is needed to ensure that the running process is not interrupted and the failed service is quickly and efficiently replaced. In this paper, we present two algorithms to solve the problem. The first algorithm uses the backup path approach so that the predecessor of a failed service may quickly switch to a predefined backup path. The second algorithm uses the replacement path approach to re-construct a new process by skipping a failed service. All these dynamic adaptations can be done by business process itself or a QoS broker which is part of an autonomic system. The simulation result shows that, when producing the information needed for dynamic adaptation, the running time of business process composition increases only by a constant factor regardless of the system size.

 ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM  
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the eighteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  .  
 We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.  
 Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.  
 Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  , published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.  
 PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 Please select Paper Submissions  from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.  
 Any questions regarding paper submissions should be sent to the Program Committee Chairs (Claudio Gentille and Aldo Pacchiano) at the email address isaim-l@lists.ou.edu  .

 Theme: Decarbonizing the Construction Industry   
  
 Topics Framework  
 The technical areas summarize the paper topic areas of interest, which represents all the research themes that are relevant to ISARC/IAARC. This is an important mechanism for the technical committee to consolidate the knowledge accumulated from each year’s conference while allowing for the smooth incorporation of new research topics and trends in the community.  
 Please note that we require authors upon submission to roughly classify their paper by a multiple choice mode for each of the 3 axis of the topic framework.   
 The areas will be used to facilitate submission review management 
  The number of areas does not necessarily map one-on-one to the Area Chairs; depending on the submission number, some technical areas could have more than one Area Chair while other areas might have none 
  Based on the previous years’ ISARC, the technical areas are grouped into the following three Axes; upon submission of the full paper, authors need to select one and only one major Axis, and up to three areas (among all the Axes) 
    
 Axis 1: Automation tools and techniques  – comprises but is not limited to the following topics:

 Paper and Presentation Types  
 With a minimum change to the ISARC history, we introduced in 2021 different types of papers and presentations for ISARC. These intend to improve the conference’s quality and attendees’ experience.  
 Two types of papers | Scientific Papers | These are the regular “technical papers” as in previous ISARC. 
  It stresses stronger requirements on scientific contributions and the intellectual merits of the accepted papers. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: 6~8 pages, including references. 
  Short Papers | To attract more industry attendance to ISARC, we introduce this new type of paper with a higher focus on practical applications and case studies in real construction projects 
  This type of paper is more friendly for case study papers or industry submissions. 
  This is similar to extended abstracts or industry papers in other conferences. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: no more than 4 pages, including references. 
  Three types of presentation | Presentation Template (.PPTX) – TBA 
  Presentation types are not necessarily connected with the paper types indicated above. 
  The presentation types are decided by the technical committee based on the area chairs and reviewers’ recommendations. | The ranking of all papers is based on the average paper ratings from the reviewers and the presentation types recommended by area chairs. 
  Keynote & Plenary talks | The top papers will be classified as keynote and plenary talks based on their ranking. The number of top papers will be determined based on the number of submissions and the duration of the conference. Typically, there might be 1 keynote + 2 plenary talks/day. 
  Each keynote talk is a 20-minute live presentation + 10-minute Q&A. 
  Each plenary talk is a 15-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Parallel talks | Parallel track names are determined by the technical committee. 
  Each parallel talk is a 8-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Poster talks | Depending on the conference setting/infrastructure, the papers selected for Poster presentation will be displayed during the whole conference, starting from the reception event. In general, during the welcome reception there will be dedicated sessions for Q&A of posters.

 ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM  
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the eighteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  .  
 We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.  
 Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.  
 Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  , published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.  
 PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 Please select Paper Submissions  from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.  
 Any questions regarding paper submissions should be sent to the Program Committee Chairs (Claudio Gentille and Aldo Pacchiano) at the email address isaim-l@lists.ou.edu  .

 Paper and Presentation Types  
 With a minimum change to the ISARC history, we introduced in 2021 different types of papers and presentations for ISARC. These intend to improve the conference’s quality and attendees’ experience.  
 Two types of papers | Scientific Papers | These are the regular “technical papers” as in previous ISARC. 
  It stresses stronger requirements on scientific contributions and the intellectual merits of the accepted papers. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: 6~8 pages, including references. 
  Short Papers | To attract more industry attendance to ISARC, we introduce this new type of paper with a higher focus on practical applications and case studies in real construction projects 
  This type of paper is more friendly for case study papers or industry submissions. 
  This is similar to extended abstracts or industry papers in other conferences. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: no more than 4 pages, including references. 
  Three types of presentation | Presentation Template (.PPTX) – TBA 
  Presentation types are not necessarily connected with the paper types indicated above. 
  The presentation types are decided by the technical committee based on the area chairs and reviewers’ recommendations. | The ranking of all papers is based on the average paper ratings from the reviewers and the presentation types recommended by area chairs. 
  Keynote & Plenary talks | The top papers will be classified as keynote and plenary talks based on their ranking. The number of top papers will be determined based on the number of submissions and the duration of the conference. Typically, there might be 1 keynote + 2 plenary talks/day. 
  Each keynote talk is a 20-minute live presentation + 10-minute Q&A. 
  Each plenary talk is a 15-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Parallel talks | Parallel track names are determined by the technical committee. 
  Each parallel talk is a 8-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Poster talks | Depending on the conference setting/infrastructure, the papers selected for Poster presentation will be displayed during the whole conference, starting from the reception event. In general, during the welcome reception there will be dedicated sessions for Q&A of posters.

 Scope  
 IWCIA'24 is the twenty second of a series of international meetings on combinatorial image analysis. It will take place in Fort Lauderdale, FL, January 8-10, 2024. Previous meetings were held in Paris (France, 1991), Ube (Japan, 1992), Washington DC (USA, 1994), Lyon (France, 1995), Hiroshima (Japan, 1997), Madras (India, 1999), Caen (France, 2000), Philadelphia (USA, 2001), Palermo (Italy, 2003), Auckland (New Zealand, 2004), Berlin (Germany, 2006), Buffalo, NY (USA, 2008), Playa del Carmen (Mexico, 2009), Madrid (Spain, 2011), Austin (Texas, 2012), Brno (Czech Republic, 2014), Kolkata (India, 2015), Porto (Portugal, 2018), Novi Sad (Serbia, 2020), and Messina (Italy, 2022).  
 Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the "discrete approach" to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.  
 The scientific program of the workshop consists of keynote talks and contributed papers.  
 The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer's "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" series (pending approval).  
 Topics  
 The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:  
 Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space; Lattice polygons and polytopes 
  Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology 
  Digital manifolds; Geometry of digital curves and surfaces 
  Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as "pinched digital surfaces") 
  Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons 
  Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries 
  Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors 
  Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching 
  Computational geometry and imaging sciences 
  Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis 
  Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction 
  Processing "very large" digital pictures; Methods for image compression 
  Parallel architectures and algorithms 
  Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis 
  Discrete tomography 
  Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata 
  Mathematical morphology and image analysis 
  Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others 
  The submitted papers are expected to meet high standards satisfying serious evaluation criteria. Each paper will be reviewed thoroughly by at least two members of the Program Committee. Double-blind review process will be applied to ensure maximal objectiveness.

 ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM  
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the eighteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  .  
 We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.  
 Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.  
 Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  , published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.  
 PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 Please select Paper Submissions  from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.

 Paper and Presentation Types  
 With a minimum change to the ISARC history, we introduced in 2021 different types of papers and presentations for ISARC. These intend to improve the conference’s quality and attendees’ experience.  
 Two types of papers | Scientific Papers | These are the regular “technical papers” as in previous ISARC. 
  It stresses stronger requirements on scientific contributions and the intellectual merits of the accepted papers. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: 6~8 pages, including references. 
  Short Papers | To attract more industry attendance to ISARC, we introduce this new type of paper with a higher focus on practical applications and case studies in real construction projects 
  This type of paper is more friendly for case study papers or industry submissions. 
  This is similar to extended abstracts or industry papers in other conferences. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: no more than 4 pages, including references. 
  Three types of presentation | Presentation Template (.PPTX) – TBA 
  Presentation types are not necessarily connected with the paper types indicated above. 
  The presentation types are decided by the technical committee based on the area chairs and reviewers’ recommendations. | The ranking of all papers is based on the average paper ratings from the reviewers and the presentation types recommended by area chairs. 
  Keynote & Plenary talks | The top papers will be classified as keynote and plenary talks based on their ranking. The number of top papers will be determined based on the number of submissions and the duration of the conference. Typically, there might be 1 keynote + 2 plenary talks/day. 
  Each keynote talk is a 20-minute live presentation + 10-minute Q&A. 
  Each plenary talk is a 15-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Parallel talks | Parallel track names are determined by the technical committee. 
  Each parallel talk is a 8-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Poster talks | Depending on the conference setting/infrastructure, the papers selected for Poster presentation will be displayed during the whole conference, starting from the reception event. In general, during the welcome reception there will be dedicated sessions for Q&A of posters.

 Paper and Presentation Types  
 With a minimum change to the ISARC history, we introduced in 2021 different types of papers and presentations for ISARC. These intend to improve the conference’s quality and attendees’ experience.  
 Two types of papers | Scientific Papers | These are the regular “technical papers” as in previous ISARC. 
  It stresses stronger requirements on scientific contributions and the intellectual merits of the accepted papers. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: 6~8 pages, including references. 
  Short Papers | To attract more industry attendance to ISARC, we introduce this new type of paper with a higher focus on practical applications and case studies in real construction projects 
  This type of paper is more friendly for case study papers or industry submissions. 
  This is similar to extended abstracts or industry papers in other conferences. 
  Included in annual ISARC proceedings (available | online | at no cost) and Scopus listing 
  Recommended length: no more than 4 pages, including references. 
  Three types of presentation | Presentation Template (.PPTX) – TBA 
  Presentation types are not necessarily connected with the paper types indicated above. 
  The presentation types are decided by the technical committee based on the area chairs and reviewers’ recommendations. | The ranking of all papers is based on the average paper ratings from the reviewers and the presentation types recommended by area chairs. 
  Keynote & Plenary talks | The top papers will be classified as keynote and plenary talks based on their ranking. The number of top papers will be determined based on the number of submissions and the duration of the conference. Typically, there might be 1 keynote + 2 plenary talks/day. 
  Each keynote talk is a 20-minute live presentation + 10-minute Q&A. 
  Each plenary talk is a 15-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Parallel talks | Parallel track names are determined by the technical committee. 
  Each parallel talk is a 8-minute live presentation + 5-minute Q&A. 
  Poster talks | Depending on the conference setting/infrastructure, the papers selected for Poster presentation will be displayed during the whole conference, starting from the reception event. In general, during the welcome reception there will be dedicated sessions for Q&A of posters.

 In June 2018, Riksdagen (the Swedish Parliament) decided to pass the law on electronic invoicing as a result of public procurement (SFS 2018:1277). The law states that all purchases, regardless of value, as a result of the procurement laws LOU, LUF, LUFS or LUK must be done using electronic invoices.  
 For more information about electronic invoicing and legislation, see digg.se  , sfti.se  and skr.se  as well as riksdagen.se  .

  Authors may include as many pages of appendices as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. If you wish to include an appendix, please add it after your references and keep in mind the double blind guidelines. 
  If any content in the Research Paper is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools, authors must transparently and thoroughly describe their use in the methods, acknowledgment, or equivalent section of the paper. Description is not necessary for tools used solely for improving spelling, grammar, and general editing. Authors are accountable for the accuracy of information provided by AI tools and for referencing any supporting work based on that information. 
  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper’s track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers’ outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee’s meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025. 
  For a paper to be included in the IEEE Xplore proceedings, at least one author must present it at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be excluded from the proceedings. 
  One author is eligible for a complimentary conference participation pass. 
  Every paper presenter needs to submit a short, pre-recorded summary video of the paper before the conference. 
  Presentation slides and short videos will be available on the event platform (Swapcard) for registered attendees. 
  Travel, accommodation, registration fees for other authors, and other such expenses will not be covered by the ISC organizers. 

 Hans Meuer Award  

 Named in honor of ISC’s founding father, the winning research paper will receive a 3000 euro cash prize and an award certificate.

 This document is intended to serve as a set of guidelines for submissions to the 52 nd  IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA 2025). The format is derived from the ACM template's sample-sigconf.tex file, and is used with an objective of keeping the submission version similar to the camera ready version. In an effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all submissions to ISCA 2025 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed below. Submissions that violate these instructions may not be reviewed, at the discretion of the program chairs, in order to maintain a review process that is fair to all potential authors.  

  Paper Evaluation Objectives  
 The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation – while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in ISCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc.  

  Paper Formatting  
 Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a maximum of 11 pages  of single-spaced two-column text, not including references  . You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions. If you are using LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you use the ISCA 2025 ACM template  . The sample paper  was prepared with that template. The general ACM templates (Latex, Microsoft Word or Overleaf) can be accessed here  .  
 Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission.  This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality.  

  View Sample Paper    

 Field | Value 
 Page Limit | 11 pages, not including references 
 File Format | PDF 
 Paper Size | US Letter: 8.5in x 11in 
 References | no page limit, list all authors' names 

  Content  
 Reviewing will be double blind  : please do not include any author names on any submitted documents except in the space provided on the submission form. You must also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. For example, if you are building on your own  prior work in the papers, you would say something like: “While the authors of [x][y] did X, Y, and Z, this paper additionally does W and is therefore much better.” Do NOT omit or anonymize references for blind review. There is one exception to this for your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL, arXiv, workshops without archived proceedings, etc., as discussed later in this document.  
 Figures and Tables  
 Ensure that the figures and tables are legible. Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main text. Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly distinguishable in grayscale.  
 References  
 There is no length limit for references. Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper. Papers not meeting this requirement will be rejected. Authors of NSF proposals should be familiar with this requirement. Knowing all authors of related work will help find the best reviewers. Since there is no length limit for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space here.  

  Paper Submission Instructions  
 Guidelines for Determining Authorship  
 ACM guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a substantial intellectual contribution.  It is assumed that all authors have had a significant role in the creation of an article that bears their names. In particular, the authorship credit must be reserved only for individuals who have met each of the following conditions:  
 Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the article; 
  Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content; and 
  Approved the final version of the article as accepted for publication, including references. 
  A detailed description of the ACM authorship guidelines and responsibilities is available here  . Per these guidelines, it is not acceptable to award honorary authorship or gift authorship. Please keep these guidelines in mind while determining the author list of your paper.  
 Declaring Authors  
 Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  
 Areas and Topics  
 Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of ISCA, please check with the program chairs – ISCA is a broad multidisciplinary conference and encourages new topics.  
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected.  
 Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper. A conflict occurs in the following cases:  
 Between advisors and advisees, forever. 
  Between family members, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  Between people who have collaborated in the last FIVE years. This collaboration can consist of a joint research or development project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the potential reviewer (as opposed to company funding) to an author of the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as tutorials or studies, is not cause for conflict. When in doubt, the author should check with the | program chairs | . 
  Between people from the same institution or who were in the same institution in the last FIVE years. 
  Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment. 
  "Service" collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects.  
 On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The program chairs may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.  
 Most reviews will be solicited among the members of the program committee and the external review committee but other members from the community may also write reviews. Please declare all your conflicts (not just restricted to the PC and ERC)  on the submission form. When in doubt, contact the program chairs.  
 Concurrent Submissions and Workshops  
 By submitting a manuscript to ISCA 2025, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference journal, or the archived proceedings of a workshop (e.g., in the ACM/IEEE digital library) – see exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be under review for any other conference or journal or an archived proceedings of a workshop during the ISCA 2025 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.  
 The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors' own papers in (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM/IEEE digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL or arXiv where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. In all such cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the above work to preserve author anonymity. This information must, however, be provided on the submission form – the PC chair will make this information available to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review. If you have already put your manuscript on arXiv, in the interest of double blind review, modify the title for the version you submit to ISCA. As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program chairs  .  
 Finally, the ACM Plagiarism Policy  and the IEEE Plagiarism Policy  cover a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one's own work.  

  Additional Rules for Authors  
 Authors MUST:  
 Abide by the ACM code of ethics and the IEEE code of ethics. 
  Abide by the criterion for authorship laid out by ACM and IEEE. Authorship is reserved only for individuals making substantial intellectual contributions. Gifting authorship is strictly prohibited. 
  List all legitimate CoIs and only legitimate CoIs. Asking someone for feedback on a draft of the paper or discussing the idea with someone does not create a CoI. 
  Abide by the Concurrent Submission Policy (see above). 
  Anonymize their submission for double-anonymous reviewing. This means not having any author names on any submitted documents, including in PDF metadata, except in the space provided on the submission form. If referring to one’s work, authors must do so in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. References must not be omitted or anonymized. 
  Fully anonymize any link to artifacts produced by them concerning the submission (e.g., GitHub repository). Remove any links to artifacts that cannot be fully anonymized. 
  Report any allegations of submission or reviewing misconduct to the Program Chairs, who has the responsibility to follow up on them. The only exception is if the complaint is about the Program Chairs; in this case, the Steering Committee should be contacted. 
  Make no assumptions as to whether a particular paper represents a “community paper” and whether its co-authors are or are not conflicted with each other. The decision rests entirely with the Program Chairs, who must be either petitioned explicitly or will be presented with the choice through a conflict-tracking tool. A community paper is defined as a paper presenting a survey, compendium, tool, or artifact to which multiple authors contribute without engaging in an actual project collaboration (e.g., a paper describing an open-source software framework to which the authors have contributed different modules). 
  Authors MUST NOT:  
 Contact reviewers or PC members about any submission, including their own. This includes asking about the outcome of a submission following the online discussion period and the PC meeting. Similarly, authors are not allowed to ask another party to contact the reviewers on their behalf. 
  List potential reviewers as conflicts of interest based solely on fear or suspicion of a negative bias. If an author believes there exists clear and articulable evidence of a negative bias against their work from a potential reviewer, the author may contact the Program Chairs and present such evidence in support of their case. The Program Chairs must acknowledge receipt and may solicit additional information. The Program Chairs are not required to notify the authors of any decision taken. 
  Attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively. 
  Contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers. 
  Disclose the content of reviews for one’s paper publicly before the results are announced. Any grievances should be directed to the Program Chairs.

  Authors may include as many pages of appendices as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. If you wish to include an appendix, please add it after your references and keep in mind the double blind guidelines. 
  If any content in the Research Paper is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools, authors must transparently and thoroughly describe their use in the methods, acknowledgment, or equivalent section of the paper. Description is not necessary for tools used solely for improving spelling, grammar, and general editing. Authors are accountable for the accuracy of information provided by AI tools and for referencing any supporting work based on that information. 
  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper’s track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers’ outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee’s meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025. 
  For a paper to be included in the IEEE Xplore proceedings, at least one author must present it at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be excluded from the proceedings. 
  One author is eligible for a complimentary conference participation pass. 
  Every paper presenter needs to submit a short, pre-recorded summary video of the paper before the conference. 
  Presentation slides and short videos will be available on the event platform (Swapcard) for registered attendees. 
  Travel, accommodation, registration fees for other authors, and other such expenses will not be covered by the ISC organizers. 

 Hans Meuer Award  

 Named in honor of ISC’s founding father, the winning research paper will receive a 3000 euro cash prize and an award certificate.
