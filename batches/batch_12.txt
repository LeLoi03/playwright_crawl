 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”

 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 Language matters  
 At the IAS, we actively use language that puts people first. This is because words have power: they bestow or remove dignity, build or break stigma, and divide or unite the HIV response. Through the words we choose to use at the IAS, we acknowledge that a person is so much more than a condition; we promote inclusivity, dialogue and equality.

 Disseminating the latest research  

 We make the latest HIV knowledge available to a wide audience  

 Recognizing the importance of widespread knowledge exchange, the IAS offers two programmes to share the latest HIV research with a broad audience.  
 The Journal of the International AIDS Society  (JIAS)  , a renowned open-access scientific journal, covers various aspects of HIV science, with a special focus on implementation science.  
 The IAS Educational Fund  aims to facilitate bridging the gap between evidence-based science, policy and action. It keeps regional stakeholders updated on the latest HIV research through workshops, symposia and webinars. The fund also provides inclusive educational opportunities to key stakeholders through mentorship opportunities and scholarships for IAS conferences.

 Knowledge Discovery (KD) is an interdisciplinary domain focusing upon methodologies for identifying valid, hidden, novel, potentially useful and meaningful information from within data of all kinds. Knowledge discovery encompasses an end-to-end process involving: data preparation, the application of learning techniques and the presentation of the acquired knowledge. The learning techniques used range from statistically-based data mining, through sophisticated machine learning to deep learning facilitated but recent increases in computer processing power. Current trends in the field of KD include Explainable AI, Hybrid-learning, and the application of knowledge discovery to ever increasingly diverse data sets. Information Retrieval (IR), in turn, is concerned with the gathering of relevant information, from unstructured and semantically fuzzy data in texts and other media, typically in response to a user query. This encompasses searching for information within documents and for metadata about documents, as well as searching relational databases and the Web. Automation of IR enables the reduction of what has been called "information overload". The tools and techniques of KD are increasingly used to enhance and automate information retrieval processes. Current trends in IR include learning to rank models, data representation using embedding techniques, and the use of knowledge graph technology. The scope of the KDIR conference covers all aspect KD and IR, and the overlap between the two.

 The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence, covering both applications and current research work. On one side it focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, and also Distributed Problem Solving. On the other side it focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception. Applications are in both areas. They are using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Legal Technologies and Quantum Computing.  
   
  The last four years the research emphasis has shifted towards Explainable AI and Interpretable AI with a focus on trustworthiness, fairness, privacy, safety, security and ethical issues. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications.

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI 2025)    

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series that focuses on the study of Artificial Intelligence systems that cooperate synergistically, proactively and purposefully with humans, amplifying instead of replacing human intelligence. HHAI aims for AI systems that work together with humans, emphasizing the need for adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems. HHAI systems leverage human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses, while taking into account social, ethical and legal considerations.  
 HHAI 2025 will be held on June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy, and is the fourth conference in the series.   
 The HHAI field is driven by developments in AI, but it also requires fundamentally new approaches and solutions. Thus, we encourage collaborations across research domains such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy and ethics, complex systems, and others. In this fourth international conference, we invite scholars from these fields to submit their best original – new as well as in progress – works, and visionary ideas on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 14th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (IC3K): how it was and who got the Best Paper Award?  
 October 26, 2022  October 29, 2022    Anastasija Nikiforova      
  
 In this post I would like to briefly elaborate on a truly insightful 14th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (IC3K)   , where I was honored to participate as a speaker, presenting our paper “ Putting FAIR principles in the context of research information: FAIRness for CRIS and CRIS for FAIRness    ” (authors: Otmane Azeroual, Joachim Schopfel and Janne Polonen, and Anastasija Nikiforova), and as a chair of two absolutely amazing sessions, where live and fruitful discussions took place, which is a real indicator of the success of such! And spoiler, our paper was recognized as the Best Paper! (i.e., best paper award goes to… :))  

 IC3K consists of three subconferences, namely 14th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval (KDIR), 14th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development (KEOD),   and 14th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Information Systems (KMIS)   ,  where the latter is the one, to which my paper has been accepted, and also won the Best Paper Award – I know, this is a repetition, but I am glad to receive it, same as the euroCRIS community is proud for us – read more here…    !  
 Briefly about our study, with which we mostly wanted to urge a call for action in the area of CRIS and their FAIRness. Of course, this is all about the digitization, which take place in various domain, including but not limited to the research domain, where it refers to the increasing integration and analysis of research information as part of the research data management process. However, it is not clear whether this research information is actually used and, more importantly, whether this information and data are of sufficient quality, and value and knowledge could be extracted from them. It is considered that FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) represent a promising asset to achieve this. Since their publication (by one of the colleagues I work together in European Open Science Cloud), they have rapidly proliferated and have become part of both national and international research funding programs. A special feature of the FAIR principles is the emphasis on the legibility, readability, and understandability of data. At the same time, they pose a prerequisite for data and their reliability, trustworthiness, and quality. In this sense, the importance of applying FAIR principles to research information and respective systems such as Current Research Information Systems (CRIS, also known as RIS, RIMS), which is an underrepresented subject for research, is the subject of our study. What should be kept in mind is that the research information is not just research data, and research information management systems such as CRIS are not just repositories for research data. They are much more complex, alive, dynamic, interactive and multi-stakeholder objects. However, in the real-world they are not directly subject to the FAIR research data management guiding principles. Thus, supporting the call for the need for a ”one-stop-shop and register-once use-many approach”, we argue that CRIS is a key component of the research infrastructure landscape / ecosystem, directly targeted and enabled by operational application and the promotion of FAIR principles. We hypothesize that the improvement of FAIRness is a bidirectional process, where CRIS promotes FAIRness of data and infrastructures, and FAIR principles push further improvements to the underlying CRIS. All in all, three propositions on which we elaborate in our paper and invite everyone representing this domain to think of, are:  
 1. research information management systems (CRIS) are helpful to assess the FAIRness of research data and data repositories;  
 2. research information management systems (CRIS) contribute to the FAIRness of other research infrastructure;  
 3. research information management systems (CRIS) can be improved through the application of the FAIR principles.   
 Here, we have raised a discussion on this topic showing that the improvement of FAIRness is a dual or bidirectional process, where CRIS promotes and contributes to the FAIRness of data and infrastructures, and FAIR principles push for further improvement in the underlying CRIS data model and format, positively affecting the sustainability of these systems and underlying artifacts. CRIS are beneficial for FAIR, and FAIR is beneficial for CRIS. Nevertheless, as pointed out by (Tatum and Brown, 2018), the impact of CRIS on FAIRness is mainly focused on the (1) findability (“F” in FAIR) through the use of persistent identifiers and (2) interoperability (“I” in FAIR) through standard metadata, while the impact on the other two principles, namely accessibility and reusability (“A” and “R” in FAIR) seems to be more indirect, related to and conditioned by metadata on licensing and access. Paraphrasing the statement that “FAIRness is necessary, but not sufficient for ‘open’” (Tatum and Brown, 2018), our conclusion is that “CRIS are necessary but not sufficient for FAIRness”.  
 This study differs significantly from what I typically talk about, but it was to contribute to it, thereby sharing the experience I gain in European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and respective Task Force I am involved in – “FAIR metrics and data quality”. It also allowed me to provide some insights on what we are dealing with within this domain and how our activities contribute to the currently limited body of knowledge on this topic.

 A bit about the sessions I chaired and topics raised within them, which were very diverse but equally relevant and interesting. I was kindly invited to chair two sessions, namely “ Big Data and Analytics  ” and “ Knowledge management Strategies and Implementations  ”, where the papers on the following topics were presented:  
 Decision Support for Production Control based on Machine Learning by Simulation-generated Data (Konstantin Muehlbauer, Lukas Rissmann, Sebastian Meissner, Landshut University of Applied Sciences, Germany); 
  Exploring the Test Driven Development of a Fraud Detection Application using the Google Cloud Platform (Daniel Staegemann, Matthias Volk, Maneendra Perera, Klaus Turowski, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany) – this paper was also recognized as the best student paper; 
  Decision Making with Clustered Majority Judgment (Emanuele D’ajello , Davide Formica, Elio Masciari, Gaia Mattia, Arianna Anniciello, Cristina Moscariello, Stefano Quintarelli, Davide Zaccarella, University of Napoli Federico II, Copernicani, Milano, Italy. 
  Virtual Reality (VR) Technology Integration in the Training Environment Leads to Behaviour Change (Amy Rosellini, University of North Texas, USA) 
  Innovation in Boutique Hotels in Valletta, Malta: A Multi-level Investigation (Kristina, University of Malta, Malta) 

 And, of course, as is the case for each and every conference, the keynotes are panelists are those, who gather the highest number of attendees, which is obvious, considering the topic they elaborate on, as well as the topics they raise and discuss. IC3K is not an exception, and the conference started with a very insightful discussion on Current Data Security Regulations and the discussion on whether they Serve or rather Restrict the Application of the Tools and Techniques of AI. Each of three speakers, namely Catholijn Jonker, Bart Verheijen, and Giancarlo Guizzardi, presented their views considering the domain they represent. As a result, both were very different, but at the same time leading you to “ I cannot agree more  ” feeling!  
 One of panelists – Catholijn Jonker (TU Delft) delivered then an absolutely exceptional keynote speech on Self-Reflective Hybrid Intelligence: Combining Human with Artificial Intelligence and Logic. Enjoyed not only the content, but also the style, where the propositions are critically elaborated on, pointing out that they are not indented to serve as a silver bullet, and the scope, as well as side-effects should be determined and considered. Truly insightful and, I would say, inspiring talk.  
 All in all, thank you, organizers – INSTICC (Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication), for bringing us together!

 CFP for AMCIS2025 “Sustainable Digital and Data Ecosystems – Navigating the Age of AI” mini-track  
 December 4, 2024  December 4, 2024    Anastasija Nikiforova      

 The Association for Information Systems (AIS) organized America’s Conference on Information Systems is coming! This year it will be held in Montreal (Canada), running under the general theme of “ Intelligent technologies for a better future  ” and the revised list of (mini-)tracks, where the special attention I invite you to draw to is a new “Sustainable Digital and Data Ecosystems – Navigating the Age of AI”  mini-track (chairs: Anastasija Nikiforova, Daniel Staegemann, George Marakas, Martin Lnenicka).  
   
 In an increasingly data-driven world, well-designed and managed digital and data ecosystems are critical to strategic innovation and competitive advantage. With the rise of new data architectures, the shift from centralized to decentralized systems, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in data management, these ecosystems are becoming more dynamic, interconnected, and complex.  
 The growing importance of emerging data architectures such as data lakehouses and data meshes coupled with the emerging technologies of AI, blockchain, cloud computing to name a few, requires us to rethink how we manage, govern, and secure data across these ecosystems. Moreover, AI is no longer a mere component but an active agent/actor in these ecosystems, transforming processes such as data governance, data quality management, and security. Simultaneously, there is a pressing need to address how these systems can remain resilient and sustainable in the face of technological disruption and societal challenges, and how interdisciplinary approaches can provide new insights into managing these digital environments.  
 This mini-track seeks to explore the evolving nature of these ecosystems and their role in fostering sustainable, resilient, and innovative digital environments.  
 We encourage research from an ecosystem perspective (grounded in systems theory) that takes a holistic view, as well as more focused studies on specific components such as policies, strategies, interfaces, methodologies, or technologies. Special attention will be paid to the ongoing evolution of these ecosystems, especially their capacity to remain trustworthy, sustainable, and resilient over time.  
 Potential topics include but are not limited to:  
 data management and governance in emerging data architectures (data lakehouse, data mesh, etc.), including data governance, data quality management, and security; 
  the role of AI in data management, including AI-augmented governance, data quality management, and security; 
  AI-driven resilience and sustainability in digital and data ecosystems, incl. AI-augmentation of data lifecycle- and business- processes; 
  conceptualization and evolution of digital and data ecosystem components and their interrelationships; 
  emerging technologies, such as blockchain, cloud computing, sensors etc., shaping the strategic development of digital and data ecosystems; 
  case studies on the transition from centralized (data warehouse, data lake, data lakehouse) to decentralized data architectures (e.g., data mesh); 
  human/user factors in digital and data ecosystems (acceptance, interactions, participation etc.); 
  empirical studies on the sustainability, trustworthiness, and resilience of digital ecosystems | ; 
  methodologies and strategies for managing evolving digital ecosystems in different sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare, government / public sector, education). 
  interdisciplinary approaches to building, managing, and sustaining digital and data ecosystems. 
  The research and innovation in digital and data ecosystems requires an interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, this track invites papers from various disciplines such as information systems, computer science, management science, data science, decision science, organizational design, policy making, complexity, and behavioral economics, and social science to continue the problematization exploration of concepts, theories, models, and tools for building, managing and sustaining ecosystems. These can be conceptual, design science research, empirical studies, industry and government case studies, and theoretical papers, including literature reviews.  
 As such, this mini-track will serve as a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue on the critical role of sustainable digital and data ecosystems in driving strategic innovation and competitive advantage. We invite researchers and practitioners alike to share their insights, theoretical perspectives, and empirical findings in this rapidly evolving domain.  
  
 This mini-track is part of “Strategic & Competitive Uses of Information and Digital Technologies (SCUIDT)” track (chairs: Jack Becker, Russell Torres, Parisa Aasi, Vess Johnson).  
 For more information, see AMCIS2025 website  (for this (min-)track, navigate to “Strategic & Competitive Uses of Information and Digital Technologies (SCUIDT)” track).  
 Is your research related to any of the above topics? Then do not wait – submit! 📅📅📅  Submissions are due February 28, 2025  .

 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems - ACSOS 2025  
   
 We are happy to announce that the fifth edition of the International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) will take place in Tokyo, Japan from September 29th to October 03rd, 2025.  
 The International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum to share the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly embracing autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.

 The 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum for sharing the latest research results, ideas, and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation, and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly relying on autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture, to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.  
 Despite this rise in autonomic and self-* systems, there remains a wide range of fundamental challenges in understanding how to design, control, reason about, and trust such systems. The ACSOS conference solicits novel research on these topics in fundamentals and methods as well as applications for autonomic and self-* systems. ACSOS is particularly proud of its long-standing academic breadth and innovative industry contributions and regularly features work from computational biologists through to operating systems researchers – united by the common theme of autonomous systems. The conference program will include research papers, in-practice experience reports, posters, demos, and a doctoral symposium. ACSOS 2024 solicits contributions from among (but not limited to) the following autonomic, self-adaptive and self-organizing theories, methods, and applications:

 Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics. To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes. There should be a statement about the novel scientific contribution. The relation to prior work must be well-developed. The paper ought to report a full and satisfying discussion of its findings.   
 Papers on generative AI, machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics. 
  Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged. 
  Papers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations. 
  Papers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation. 
  All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes.

  All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes. 
  It is highly recommended that code and data be published alongside the papers for all submissions to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews.   
 Paper must formatted using the ACM sigconf template (for LaTeX) or the interim template layout.docx (for Word), both at  http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   All papers should be converted to PDF prior to electronic submission. Papers that do not adhere to these conditions will be rejected without review.   
 Submissions should be uploaded to the conference support system (to be supplied soon) by the submission deadline.   
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper, the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved.   
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper.   
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review.   

 Calls For Workshops  

 ICAIL 2025 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June the 16th and Friday, June the 20th. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest. Proposals should be 2 to 4 pages and include at least the following information:   
 The workshop or tutorial topic and goals, their significance, and their appropriateness for ICAIL 2025 
  The intended audience, including the research areas from which participants may come, the likely number of participants (with some of their names, if known), and plans for publicizing the workshop 
  Organization of the workshop or tutorial, including the intended format (such as invited talks, presentations, panel discussions, or other methods for ensuring an interactive atmosphere) and the expected length (full day or half day) 
  Organizers’ details: a description of the main organizers’ background in the proposed topic; and complete addresses including web pages of all organizers and committee members (if applicable) 
  Proposals for workshops and tutorials must be submitted in a filling form (to be supplied soon), by the submission deadline.   

 Calls For Demonstrations  

 A session will be organized for the demonstration of creative, robust, and practical working applications and tools.  Where a demonstration is not connected to a submitted paper, a two-page extended abstract about the system should be submitted for review  ,  via the conference support system and following the instructions on paper submission. Accepted extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. For those demonstrations that are connected to a submitted paper, no separate statement about the demonstration needs to be submitted, but the author(s) should send an email to the Program Chair by the demo submission deadline to register their interest in demonstrating their work at this session.

 ICAART is sponsored by INSTICC  – Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication  
    
  SCOPE  
 The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence, covering both applications and current research work. On one side it focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, and also Distributed Problem Solving. On the other side it focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception. Applications are in both areas. They are using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Legal Technologies and Quantum Computing.  
   
  The last four years the research emphasis has shifted towards Explainable AI and Interpretable AI with a focus on trustworthiness, fairness, privacy, safety, security and ethical issues. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications.  

  Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICAART with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.  

  Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website.

 Long-term Research Interests in Multi-discipline AI  

 I am interested in apply AI technologies (Computer vision, Natural language processing, Data analytics, etc.) to assist/support non-AI background researchers from multi-discipline to find the best solution for their research topics. And target joint grant applications and joint supervision opportunities to  cultivate Ph.D. students with comprehensive abilities who can solve research problems using State-of-the-art Technologies. Areas may include but not limited to health  , education  , agriculture  , astronomy  , and engineering  . I am always open to research questions from Multi-discipline and always stay hungry, and stay foolish to the knowledge I do not know.   

 One Research Question  

 Do Deep Neural Network models have a memory to remember things like humans rather than just comparing features?

 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems - ACSOS 2025  
   
 We are happy to announce that the fifth edition of the International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) will take place in Tokyo, Japan from September 29th to October 03rd, 2025.  
 The International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum to share the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly embracing autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2017 edition, 7.89%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 52.14%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 8.57%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 17.86%  of all publications and 21.43%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.

  All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes. 
  It is highly recommended that code and data be published alongside the papers for all submissions to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews.   
 Paper must formatted using the ACM sigconf template (for LaTeX) or the interim template layout.docx (for Word), both at  http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   All papers should be converted to PDF prior to electronic submission. Papers that do not adhere to these conditions will be rejected without review.   
 Submissions should be uploaded to the conference support system (to be supplied soon) by the submission deadline.   
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper, the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved.   
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper.   
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review.   

 Calls For Workshops  

 ICAIL 2025 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June the 16th and Friday, June the 20th. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest.

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 About ICAISC 2025  
 The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing ICAISC 2025 will be held in Zakopane (situated in the High Tatra mountains), Poland in June 22-26, 2025 in Bachleda Kasprowy Zakopane Hotel  . The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and engineers to present and discuss the latest scientific results and methods. The conference will include keynote addresses, contributed papers, and numerous lectures and tutorials on a wide range of topics. The Conference will be held in the hybrid mode: online and on-site in Zakopane  . The authors of accepted papers will have a choice to present their papers on-line, or on site in Zakopane, Mercury Kasprowy Hotel, Poland. All accepted papers, irrespective of the presentation mode, will be included in the LNAI conference proceedings.  
 The working language of the conference is English. Only original, unpublished papers are invited. Authors should submit an electronic version of papers by the conference web page. The papers should be organized in accordance with a common scientific structure (abstract, state of the art in the field, intention, used methodology, obtained results and references). Papers will undergo double-blind reviewing by an international committee, and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the conference topics. Please prepare anonymized versions of the paper being submitted. Please preserve anonymity by avoiding providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements, links to websites and the literature references. After the notification of acceptance, authors will be allowed to make a correction in accordance with the suggestions of the reviewers and submit final camera-ready papers in Latex format only. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer LNAI proceedings will be available online shortly after the conference. Accepted papers must be presented by the author(s) personally to be published in the conference proceedings.  
 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Venue  
 The conference is organized in Poland's premier mountain resort Zakopane, the beautiful and picturesque capital of the Polish High Tatra Mountains. Even though Zakopane is called Poland's winter capital, it is an excellent place to visit in spring. Situated at the foot of the Tatra Mountains and the Tatra National Park (with Poland's highest peak, Rysy mountain (2499m)), it offers you a chance to hike on over 240km of marked hiking trails for beginners as well as experienced climbers and explore caves (accessible only in summer). The town boasts many historic monuments, museums, art galleries and exhibitions. On your way to Zakopane you may visit Cracow, one of the most historic Polish cities, with a wonderfully preserved old city center and the largest medieval square in Europe.

 From Cracow to Zakopane  From Balice Airport in Cracow you have to get to the Cracow PKP Railway Station area to take a bus to Zakopane. To do so you can:  
 call a taxi (phone numbers e.g. 9661 or 9622 in Cracow) cost apr 40 PLN, 
  or take a bus number 192 or 208 (ticket is less than 3 PLN). 
   
 When you arrive in Cracow you do not need to book a bus to Zakopane as there are frequent shuttle buses to Zakopane, which leave apr. every 40 min. from the area of the PKP Railway Station. The Cracow-Zakopane line is serviced by Szwagropol, trans-Frej and PKS companies. The ticket costs apr. 10 PLN. Alternatively you can use a train but the train is slower ( Polish State Railways Time-table  ).  
   
 How to reach ICAISC from Zakopane  
 Participants who arrive in Zakopane are advised to take a private mini-bus (or a taxi) in the direction to Bachleda Kasprowy Zakopane Hotel. The cost of taxi is apr. 30PLN. You can call a taxi from a payphone (phone number in Zakopane: 919 or (+48)(20) 66666).

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP)  
 ICALP joined SafeToC http://safetoc.org/  (code of conduct here  )  
 The International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) is the flagship conference and annual meeting of the EATCS. The conference was launched in 1972 and covers all aspects of theoretical computer science. ICALP customarily takes place during the second or third week of July.  
 ICALP’s scientific program is split into two parts: Track A of the meeting corresponds to Algorithms, Complexity, and Games, and Track B to Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming. Typical topics are: algorithmic aspects of network economics, approximation and online algorithms, automata theory, combinatorial optimisation, computational complexity, design and analysis of algorithms, formal aspects of security, foundations of databases, games and logic, logic and semantics of programs, mathematical aspects of programming, models of concurrent, reactive and stochastic systems, networked computation, parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, randomness in computing, type systems, verification and synthesis.  
 EATCS presents annually the Best EATCS Paper Award  , the Best Student  and best ICALP Paper  Awards, all awarded at ICALP. Jointly with ACM SIGLOG, EACSL and the Kurt Goedel Society, EATCS presents the Alonzo Church award. Jointly with ACM SIGACT, EATCS awards the Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science. The award ceremony takes place alternately at ICALP and STOC.  
 The proceedings of ICALP are published since 2015 in the open-access series Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik (LIPIcs) and are available at https://dblp.org/db/conf/icalp/index.html  .

 The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling  (ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology.  
 ICAPS 2025  is the 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025. The conference will be co-located with the following events:  
 KR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
  CPAIOR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research. 
  Planning and Optimisation Summer School 2025 | , the details of which will be announced here at a future date. 
  The organisers of ICAPS 2025 invite technical paper submissions  from researchers and industrial practitioners, on all aspects of automated planning and scheduling technology. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited to:  
 Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms; 
  Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved; 
  Novel tools and frameworks for analysing and verifying the properties of systems executing plans, policies or schedules; 
  Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight. 
  The following video has been prepared by the Program Committee to walk interested parties through the major changes in the organisation of the conference with respect to previous editions:

 Call for Tools Papers  
 The ICAPS 2025 Program Committee have introduced a new type of submission that follows the example of conferences such as TACAS  and CAV  to encourage and reward with visibility community efforts towards developing, maintaining and extending publicly available tools that enable and facilitate research into planning and scheduling.  
 It is common place that submissions to ICAPS include a brief section discussing implementation and engineering issues. The purpose of introducing a specific type of submissions with slightly different instructions to the rest is to put into focus the engineering issues in a self-contained and autonomous fashion, separate from contributions that focus on algorithms, theory or representations.  
 Doing so provides useful context to evaluate novelty of submissions. The subject of Tools papers can be refinements or optimizations of existing algorithms or techniques. Therefore, these submissions may not be novel from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but may well be so from an engineering perspective and have wide-ranging, long-standing impact.  
 For instance, the “two-literal watch rule” was not a significant innovation from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but its introduction along with other important techniques, had profound impacts in the applications and direction of research in Boolean Satisfiability.  
 Specific Instructions for Tools Papers  
 Submissions must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the ICAPS community.  
 Tools papers are required to provide an “artifact” along with a paper (either long or short) whose format and content satisfies the requirements given in the Call for Papers  . Arfifacts are defined as additional material (software, data sets, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and renders them fully replicable  . An artifact may for instance consist of a tool and its accompanying documentation, the input files used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper, and configuration files or other documents that describe the parameters used in the experiments.  
 Papers in this category must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, a discussion of how the tool is used and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tool along with a comparison with other tools and previous versions of the tool.  
 Reviewers are instructed to read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria included in our instructions for reviewers  :  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper, 
  completeness, 
  documentation and ease of use, 
  availability in a permanent online repository. 
  There is no requirement of anonymising the artifact, so these submissions are de-facto single-blind  . Still, we expect that the paper submitted for review satisfy the requirements of double-blind review outlined in the Call for Papers  .  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifacts must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Materials section in the OpenReview submission form. The following text files must be found in the ZIP archive submitted as supplementary materials:  
 an abstract (ABSTRACT) that summarises the artifact and its relation to the paper, 
  a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact that must, at the very least, allow the assigned PC members to evaluate the artifact, 
  an instructions document (README) that includes: | a hyperlink to the artifact (not the binary or source code of the artifact), 
  a script to install and configure the artifact (e.g. Docker file or similar), 
  detailed instructions that enable the PC to quickly verify that the artifact is running properly, 
  detailed instructions for using the artifact to replicate the results in the paper, including estimated resources if these are non-trivial. 
  We recommend the use of Markdown  to format these text files. We recommend that artifacts are configured for broad availability: Ubuntu 22.04 or better, Windows and MacOs. Broad availability is one of the criteria for evaluating submissions.  
 The artifact hyperlink must point to a service or repository that allows interaction with or downloading the artifact in a completely anonymous fashion  . Failure to do so, or active attempts to identify the PC members reviewing the artifact, will lead to summary desk rejection  .

 Future ICALPs  
 The International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) is the main conference and annual meeting of the EATCS. This international conference was launched in 1972 and covers all aspects of theoretical computer science. ICALP customarily takes place during the second or third week of July.  
 Traditionally ICALP’s scientific program is split into two parts: Track A of the meeting corresponds to Algorithms, Complexity, and Games, and Track B to Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming. Since 2009, Track C is available on Foundations of Networks and multi-agent systems: Models, Algorithms and Information Management.  
 Typical topics discussed during recent ICALP conferences are: automata theory, computational complexity, computational geometry, computability, cryptography, data types and data structures, design and analysis of algorithms, foundations of databases, games and logic, logic programming, logic and semantics of programs, mathematical aspects of programming, models of concurrency, networked computation, parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, type systems, theorem proving, verification and synthesis.  
 EATCS presents annually the Best EATCS Paper Award  , the Best Student  and best ICALP Paper  Awards, all awarded at ICALP. Jointly with ACM SIGACT, EATCS awards annually the Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science. The award ceremony takes place alternately at ICALP and STOC (ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing).

 Call for Tools Papers  
 The ICAPS 2025 Program Committee have introduced a new type of submission that follows the example of conferences such as TACAS  and CAV  to encourage and reward with visibility community efforts towards developing, maintaining and extending publicly available tools that enable and facilitate research into planning and scheduling.  
 It is common place that submissions to ICAPS include a brief section discussing implementation and engineering issues. The purpose of introducing a specific type of submissions with slightly different instructions to the rest is to put into focus the engineering issues in a self-contained and autonomous fashion, separate from contributions that focus on algorithms, theory or representations.  
 Doing so provides useful context to evaluate novelty of submissions. The subject of Tools papers can be refinements or optimizations of existing algorithms or techniques. Therefore, these submissions may not be novel from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but may well be so from an engineering perspective and have wide-ranging, long-standing impact.  
 For instance, the “two-literal watch rule” was not a significant innovation from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but its introduction along with other important techniques, had profound impacts in the applications and direction of research in Boolean Satisfiability.  
 Specific Instructions for Tools Papers  
 Submissions must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the ICAPS community.  
 Tools papers are required to provide an “artifact” along with a paper (either long or short) whose format and content satisfies the requirements given in the Call for Papers  . Arfifacts are defined as additional material (software, data sets, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and renders them fully replicable  . An artifact may for instance consist of a tool and its accompanying documentation, the input files used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper, and configuration files or other documents that describe the parameters used in the experiments.  
 Papers in this category must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, a discussion of how the tool is used and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tool along with a comparison with other tools and previous versions of the tool.  
 Reviewers are instructed to read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria included in our instructions for reviewers  :  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper, 
  completeness, 
  documentation and ease of use, 
  availability in a permanent online repository. 
  There is no requirement of anonymising the artifact, so these submissions are de-facto single-blind  . Still, we expect that the paper submitted for review satisfy the requirements of double-blind review outlined in the Call for Papers  .  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifacts must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Materials section in the OpenReview submission form. The following text files must be found in the ZIP archive submitted as supplementary materials:  
 an abstract (ABSTRACT) that summarises the artifact and its relation to the paper, 
  a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact that must, at the very least, allow the assigned PC members to evaluate the artifact, 
  an instructions document (README) that includes: | a hyperlink to the artifact (not the binary or source code of the artifact), 
  a script to install and configure the artifact (e.g. Docker file or similar), 
  detailed instructions that enable the PC to quickly verify that the artifact is running properly, 
  detailed instructions for using the artifact to replicate the results in the paper, including estimated resources if these are non-trivial. 
  We recommend the use of Markdown  to format these text files. We recommend that artifacts are configured for broad availability: Ubuntu 22.04 or better, Windows and MacOs. Broad availability is one of the criteria for evaluating submissions.  
 The artifact hyperlink must point to a service or repository that allows interaction with or downloading the artifact in a completely anonymous fashion  . Failure to do so, or active attempts to identify the PC members reviewing the artifact, will lead to summary desk rejection  .

 Call for Tools Papers  
 The ICAPS 2025 Program Committee have introduced a new type of submission that follows the example of conferences such as TACAS  and CAV  to encourage and reward with visibility community efforts towards developing, maintaining and extending publicly available tools that enable and facilitate research into planning and scheduling.  
 It is common place that submissions to ICAPS include a brief section discussing implementation and engineering issues. The purpose of introducing a specific type of submissions with slightly different instructions to the rest is to put into focus the engineering issues in a self-contained and autonomous fashion, separate from contributions that focus on algorithms, theory or representations.  
 Doing so provides useful context to evaluate novelty of submissions. The subject of Tools papers can be refinements or optimizations of existing algorithms or techniques. Therefore, these submissions may not be novel from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but may well be so from an engineering perspective and have wide-ranging, long-standing impact.  
 For instance, the “two-literal watch rule” was not a significant innovation from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but its introduction along with other important techniques, had profound impacts in the applications and direction of research in Boolean Satisfiability.  
 Specific Instructions for Tools Papers  
 Submissions must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the ICAPS community.  
 Tools papers are required to provide an “artifact” along with a paper (either long or short) whose format and content satisfies the requirements given in the Call for Papers  . Arfifacts are defined as additional material (software, data sets, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and renders them fully replicable  . An artifact may for instance consist of a tool and its accompanying documentation, the input files used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper, and configuration files or other documents that describe the parameters used in the experiments.  
 Papers in this category must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, a discussion of how the tool is used and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tool along with a comparison with other tools and previous versions of the tool.  
 Reviewers are instructed to read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria included in our instructions for reviewers  :  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper, 
  completeness, 
  documentation and ease of use, 
  availability in a permanent online repository. 
  There is no requirement of anonymising the artifact, so these submissions are de-facto single-blind  . Still, we expect that the paper submitted for review satisfy the requirements of double-blind review outlined in the Call for Papers  .  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifacts must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Materials section in the OpenReview submission form. The following text files must be found in the ZIP archive submitted as supplementary materials:  
 an abstract (ABSTRACT) that summarises the artifact and its relation to the paper, 
  a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact that must, at the very least, allow the assigned PC members to evaluate the artifact, 
  an instructions document (README) that includes: | a hyperlink to the artifact (not the binary or source code of the artifact), 
  a script to install and configure the artifact (e.g. Docker file or similar), 
  detailed instructions that enable the PC to quickly verify that the artifact is running properly, 
  detailed instructions for using the artifact to replicate the results in the paper, including estimated resources if these are non-trivial. 
  We recommend the use of Markdown  to format these text files. We recommend that artifacts are configured for broad availability: Ubuntu 22.04 or better, Windows and MacOs. Broad availability is one of the criteria for evaluating submissions.  
 The artifact hyperlink must point to a service or repository that allows interaction with or downloading the artifact in a completely anonymous fashion  . Failure to do so, or active attempts to identify the PC members reviewing the artifact, will lead to summary desk rejection  .

 “Planning is the art and practice of thinking before acting.”  
 P@trik Haslum   
  The primary objectives of ICAPS are to further the field of automated planning and scheduling through the organization of technical meetings, including the annual ICAPS conference, through the organization of summer schools, tutorials and training activities at various events, through the organization of planning and scheduling competitions, benchmarking and other means of advancing and assessing the state of the art in the field, by promoting the involvement of young scientists in the field through scholarships and other means, and by promoting and disseminating publications, planning and scheduling systems, domains, simulators, software tools and technical material.  
  
 “Probably the biggest problem I had was I didn’t understand the importance of scheduling.”  
 Anne Donovan   
    ICAPS’s greatest strengths come from the people who make up our community. ICAPS is committed to fostering an inclusive community with opportunities for all participants without regard to age, religion, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. We strive to remove barriers and obstacles that limit participation, and we work to uncover biases that create unfair practices. Every ICAPS participant is encouraged to engage in civil discourse when opinions and points of view differ. We value and respect one another, and we will hold one another accountable when we falter. Differences are welcomed and celebrated. Join us.
