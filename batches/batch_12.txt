 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence.

 The application of artificial intelligence within information security  Willem de Ru    
 2012  
 Computer-based information systems will probably always have to contend with security issues. Much research have already gone into the field of information security. These research results have yielded some very sophisticated and effective security mechanisms and procedures. However, due to the ever increasing sophistication of criminals, combined with the ever changing and evolving information technology environment, some limitations still exist within the field of information security. Recent years have seen the proliferation of products embracing so-called artificial intelligence technologies. These products are in fields as diverse as engineering, business and medicine. The successes achieved in these fields pose the question whether artificial intelligence has a role to play within the field of information secu-

 Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Cyber Security  IJRASET Publication    
 International Journal for Research in Applied Science & Engineering Technology (IJRASET), 2022  
 The cyber security industry's financial resources and human abilities to assess and battle every new type of cyber danger have been overwhelmed by the surge in cyber assaults. With the rise of the digital world, there is a rising quantity of personal and financial data that has to be secured against cyber-attacks. In reality, cyber assaults may devastate an organization's reputation or cause it to fail totally. This study investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve cyber security. Artificial intelligence has advanced to the point that it has surpassed human capability in activities like data analytics. The analysis indicated that using AI to regulate cyber attacks has both benefits and drawbacks the benefits exceed the drawbacks. This study discovers that AI systems are likely to increase the safety of customers and enterprises in cyberspace due to the fast and efficient technology necessary to operate them [2] .

 Cyber-attackers unit investment automation technology to launch strikes, whereas many organisations unit still victimisation manual efforts to mixture internal security findings and contextualising them with external threat data. Victimisation these ancient ways that, it&#39;ll take weeks or months to sight intrusions, throughout that amount attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to compromise systems and extract info. To wear down these challenges, progressive organisations unit exploring the employment of AI (AI) in their regular cyber risk management operations. The speed of processes and conjointly the amount of data to be used in defensive the cyberspace can&#39;t be handled by humans whereas not sizeable automation. However, it&#39;s hard to develop code with customarily mounted algorithms (hard-wired logic on deciding level) for effectively defensive against the dynamically evolving attacks in networks. this instance is also handled by applying methods of computing that supply...

  TCAD Paper Submission Instructions 

 TCAD Paper Submission Instructions   

 The IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD) is published monthly. Manuscripts considered for publication should focus on algorithms, methods, techniques, and tools for the automated design of integrated circuits and systems, and on related areas. Submitted papers may be of a survey or research nature. Research papers must present original contributions and must show significant new material over descriptions or derivations available elsewhere. Survey papers are only by invitation, and should review the state-of-the-art in specific CAD fields and, at the same time, provide the readers with research perspectives and future challenges in the considered topic. Proposals for the organization of special issues are not allowed in TCAD; they are only by invitation.  
 The IEEE must of necessity assume that material submitted for publication is available for general dissemination. It is the responsibility of the Author, not the IEEE, to determine whether disclosure of their material requires the prior consent of other parties and if so, to obtain it.  

 A. Process for Submission of a Manuscript    
 Only electronic submissions will be considered. Papers should be submitted at https://ieee.atyponrex.com/journal/tcad   

 B. Style for Submission of Manuscript    
 All manuscripts must be formatted using the IEEE two-column format. Style templates can be found at | http://www.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org | . (Minimum font size is 10 pt). 
  The maximum number of pages allowed for submissions is: | Regular Papers: 14 pages 
  Transactions Brief Papers: 5 pages 
  Submitted papers that are not compliant with either the style format or the allowed page lengths will be returned to the Author. 
  The manuscript should include an informative 100- to 250-word abstract, at the head of the manuscript, which will appear with the paper. Index terms and 4-to-8 keywords describing the manuscript are also required. 
  References should appear in a separate bibliography section at the end of the paper, with items referred to by numerals in square brackets, e.g., [12]. In either case, references should be complete and in IEEE style. | Style for papers: Author, first initial(s) followed by last name, title, volume, including page numbers, month, and year. 
  Style for books: Author, title, location and publisher, year, chapter or page numbers (if desired). 
  Guideline for final manuscript preparation: Detailed instructions for preparation of the final manuscript is in the | Author guidelines for final manuscript preparation | .

 All IEEE journals require an Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)  for all authors. ORCIDs enable accurate attribution and improved discoverability of an author’s published work. The author will need a registered ORCID in order to submit a manuscript or review a proof in this journal.  
 Follow these steps to link a ScholarOne account to a registered ORCID:  
 Login to ScholarOne and click on your name in the top row of the screen. 
  Click E-mail / Name in the dropdown menu. 
  In the ORCID section at the top of the page, click the appropriate link to either register for a new ORCID or associate the account with an existing ORCID. 
  A new page will open to create and/or validate your ORCID. Once the validation is complete, the new page will close and you will return to ScholarOne. 
  Save the changes to your ScholarOne user account. 
  Authors who do not have an ORCID in their ScholarOne user account will be prompted to provide one during submission.  

 E. Disclosure of Previous Submissions    
 Authors should disclose versions of this paper that were already peer-reviewed for publications in other journals and conferences within the past two years, immaterial of the outcome.  
 If an earlier version of this paper was rejected by a different publication or conference, please provide information on how reviewer and editor comments from that review were handled. This can also include remarks that point out disagreements of the author's viewpoint with review comments from other publications.  
 If an earlier version of the paper has been accepted for conference/workshop publication or has already appeared in a conference/workshop proceeding, the authors should clearly identify the substantive improvement over the earlier conference/workshop version.  
 The material in this submission should be at least 30% different in content from any prior accepted/published version, but it is up to the review process to determine whether the additional contributions are substantive. Examples of substantive enhancements include modifications/enhancements to algorithms, improvements in evaluation methodology, new insights from additional benchmarks. Examples of additional content that does not contribute to the 30% requirement include (but is not limited to): an expanded literature review or a broadening of the introductory or background material usually does not count towards the 30% requirement.  
 Concurrent submissions of any kind (journal, conference, workshop) to this Journal are not allowed and no extensions of any previously published journal version will be accepted.  
 If a submission has no previous peer-reviewed versions, it should clearly state this on the cover page.  

 F. Policy on Self-Plagiarism    
 IEEE Publications has long indicated that verbatim copying another's work (plagiarism) is unacceptable author conduct. Moreover, the IEEE Board of Directors approved in November 2002 a new policy on Duplicate Publication and Self-Plagiarism. This policy is included in the IEEE Policies document, precisely in Sections 6.4.1B(f) and 6.4.1B(h). These two sections are indicated next:  
 (f) Plagiarism is unacceptable. The verbatim copying or reuse of one's own research) as indicated in paragraph "h" below) is considered another form of plagiarism or self-plagiarism; it is unacceptable. 
  (h) Except as indicated in Section 6.3.4 (Multiple Publication of Original Technical Material in IEEE Periodicals), authors should only submit original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication nor which is under review for another refereed publication. If authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a basis for a new submission, they are required to cite the previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new submission offers substantial novel contributions beyond those of the previously published work(s). 
  As a result, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS will carefully monitor possible self-plagiarism conducts. As a result, it will not accept for review manuscripts where a significant portion of the text is a verbatim copy of the text already published in previous works. In particular, as general requirements:  
   
 The submission material shall not have more than 40% total text overlap percentage with prior accepted/published versions of the work. 
  The authors need to include both in their cover page of the submission material and in the text of the manuscript (e.g., related work section) a clear and concise statement about the contribution of the submitted paper with respect to each of their prior relevant works. The manuscript's statement must refer to the appropriate citation(s) of the authors' previous work(s). 

 G. Review Process    
 The IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS publishes only peer-reviewed papers. The Editor will assign each submitted manuscript to an Associate Editor, who will rely on anonymous reviews to decide on the acceptance of the paper, on mandatory modifications, and on the publication in full or short form. The Author is responsible for checking the galley proofs prior to publication.  
 The articles in this journal are peer-reviewed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual  . Each published article was reviewed by a minimum of two independent reviewers using a single-anonymous peer-review process, where the identities of the reviewers are not known to the authors, but the reviewers know the identities of the authors. Articles will be screened for plagiarism before acceptance.  

 H. Open Access    
 This publication is a hybrid journal, allowing either Traditional manuscript submission or Open Access (author-pays OA) manuscript submission. Upon submission, if you choose to have your manuscript be an Open Access article, you commit to paying the discounted $2,645 OA fee if your manuscript is accepted for publication in order to enable unrestricted public access. Any other applicable charges (such as over-length page charge and/or charge for the use of color in the print format) will be billed separately once the manuscript formatting is complete but prior to the publication. If you would like your manuscript to be a Traditional submission, your article will be available to qualified subscribers and purchasers via IEEE Xplore. No OA payment is required for Traditional submission.  

 I. Page Charges    
  After a manuscript has been accepted for publication, the Author’s institution will be approached with a request to pay a voluntary charge of $110 per page to cover part of the cost of publication. If the voluntary page charge is not honored, IEEE will charge a mandatory page charge of $175 per page for each page in excess of 9. Detailed instructions will accompany the page proofs. The color charge fee structure has been simplified to a flat $275 per printed color figure.  

 J. Copyright    
 It is the policy of the IEEE to own the copyright to the technical contributions it publishes. To comply with IEEE copyright policy, Authors are required to sign an IEEE Copyright Transfer Form before publication in either the print or electronic medium. Authors must submit a signed copy of this form with their manuscript.

  Welcome to Split, Croatia    
 Split, located on Croatia’s stunning Dalmatian coast, is a vibrant city that seamlessly blends ancient history with a lively, modern atmosphere. Known for its breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea, Split is centered around the UNESCO-listed Diocletian's Palace, a massive, well-preserved Roman structure dating back to the 4th century.   
 Walking through its maze of stone streets, visitors encounter a unique mix of ancient ruins, bustling marketplaces, cozy cafes, and contemporary art galleries, giving Split a charm that appeals to both history enthusiasts and modern travelers. The city’s waterfront promenade, Riva, is the social heart of Split. With its palm-lined paths, lively restaurants, and bars, it’s an ideal spot for both locals and visitors to relax and enjoy scenic views of the harbor.   
    
 Nearby, Marjan Hill offers hiking trails with panoramic views of the city, coast, and nearby islands. Split’s beaches, such as Bačvice, are a popular draw, offering both sandy and rocky spots to unwind by the crystal-clear Adriatic waters. Split is also a gateway to Croatia’s idyllic islands, such as Hvar, Brač, and Vis, making it a top destination for island hopping and maritime adventures. With its perfect blend of cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and lively atmosphere, Split captures the essence of Croatia, offering visitors a memorable and diverse experience.

 Keynotes  

 Theme 1:  The Future of Foundational Ideas of Cognitive Science    
 Cognitive Science was born from a revolution that centered the mind as the object of study, resulting in new fields that study the nature of mental representations, consciousness, the origins of knowledge, and how the brain carries out mental computations. Which of the foundational ideas and debates that emerged from the Cognitive Revolution remain important to current discourse in our field?   

 Keynote: Susan Carey  
 Harvard University  
   
 Carey investigates the origins of human conceptual representation and has conducted work on core systems of knowledge, word learning, the construction of intuitive theories, and case studies of conceptual change including number, causal reasoning, and the language of thought. Among her most important contributions is the argument that human knowledge emanates from rich innate structures that are enriched through processes of conceptual change.  

 Theme 2: The Role of AI in Theories of the Future   
 The rapid emergence of AIs and their success in modeling diverse aspects of human language and cognition raises important questions about the future of theory building in our field. Do the engineering successes of AI suggest a new theoretical path forward for Cognitive Science? What role should foundational ideas in Cognitive Science play in theory making as we look to the future?  

 Keynote: Josh Tenenbaum  
 MIT  
   
 Tenenbaum’s work investigates the computational structure of human cognition, and includes studies of concept learning, similarity judgment, causal inference, and the formation of perceptual representations. A key focus is the nature and origin of common-sense theories, and how humans construct concepts, theories and skills from minimal examples.  

 Theme 3: New Theoretical Horizons in Cognitive Science   
 What is the future of theory in the Cognitive Sciences? In this transitional moment in Cognitive Science, what questions are most central to understanding human cognition? Which of the foundational theoretical constructs of our field deserve to be preserved in the coming years? What changes are required? What paths are most likely to lead to innovation and discovery?  

 Keynote: Lauren Ross  
 UC Irvine  
   
 Ross specializes in the philosophy of science, focusing on explanation and causation within biology, neuroscience, and medicine. Her research includes projects that explore the nature of scientific explanation, the variety of causal structures and types of explanation used in these fields, and the underlying rationale for specific forms of causal reasoning. By investigating how scientists explain phenomena and infer causal relationships, her work addresses the conceptual foundations of empirical research in the life sciences and medicine.  

 2025 Recipient of the Rumelhart Prize    

 Nora Newcombe  
 Temple University  
   
 Nora S. Newcombe (Ph.D., Harvard), is Laura H. Carnell Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. Her research in cognition and cognitive development centers on spatial cognition and episodic memory, along with translational work on STEM education. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. Past honors include the Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award from SRCD, the William James Fellow Award from APS, the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from SEP, and the Award for Distinguished Service to Psychological Science from APA.   

 The Cognitive Science Society is pleased to announce the establishment of the CogSci Grove which aims to mobilise cognitive scientists to offset carbon emissions associated with their professional activities.

 Format Cycle   
 The Cognitive Science Society plans to host a fully synchronous hybrid conference every 3 years  , starting in 2025. In the other years, the conference will be in-person. The Governing Board, with guidance from the Conference Committee and the Hybridisation Committee, approved this plan after a great deal of discussion, briefly described below:   
    
 Rationale:    
  Since COVID in 2020, the Cognitive Science Society has been discussing how best to run its annual conference. The conference landscape has also been altered by changes in technology, shifting conference norms, visa issues, several major world events, and greater attention to accessibility and the climate crisis. The pandemic allowed the Society to experiment with various types of virtual conference offerings, from being online in 2020 and 2021, to being fully hybrid conference in 2022, and streaming from only the main conference room in 2023.   
 Throughout this process, we have gotten feedback from our members about their conference experiences, including very positive feedback on our 2022 synchronous hybrid conference in Toronto. We have also examined logistic constraints, our finances and conference budget. While conference expenses have allowed us to break even in the past, our hybrid conference in 2022 and semi-hybrid conference in 2023 resulted in a substantial financial loss for the society.   
 The three-year cycle will allow us to financially and logistically sustain conferences into the future, while offering a fully hybrid experience on a regular basis.   

 Location cycle   
 The three-year location cycle for the annual conference is:   
 1: Western Europe  
  2: US or Canada  
  3: Anywhere else in the world, with a preference for locations that would serve emerging cognitive science communities and that have not previously had a CogSci conference in the vicinity. Possible destinations include Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.  

 The Cognitive Science Society is pleased to announce the establishment of the CogSci Grove which aims to mobilise cognitive scientists to offset carbon emissions associated with their professional activities.

 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia:  
 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Energy, Transport and Environmental Sustainability (IEEE CIETES) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Engineering / Cyber Physical Systems (IEEE CIES) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Image, Signal Processing and Synthetic Media (IEEE CISM) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Artificial Life and Cooperative Intelligent Systems (IEEE ALIFE-CIS) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics (IEEE CISDB) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Health and Medicine (IEEE CIHM) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Financial Engineering and Economics (IEEE CiFer) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Natural Language Processing and Social Media (IEEE CI-NLPSoMe) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on Trustworthy, Explainable and Responsible CI (IEEE CITREx) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia for Multidisciplinary Computational Intelligence Incubators (IEEE MCII) 
   
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings IEEE SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non-skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants - from fast food to Michelin star - and sport activities.  
 Late Submission Opportunities   
  IEEE SSCI 2025 offers several submission options for late-breaking research:  
 Late-Breaking Papers: | Submit an extended abstract of up to 2 pages to share preliminary research, ideas, or critiques, fostering interactive discussions. 
  Poster-Only Submissions: | Submit a short abstract (up to 250 words) to present early-stage concepts or challenges for constructive feedback. 
  Journal to Conference (J2C) Submissions: | Provide a summary (up to 1 page) of recent journal articles relevant to SSCI themes, promoting broader engagement with your research.

 Our History  

 Society Creation  
 The Society was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit professional organization in Massachusetts in 1979  . The organizing committee included Roger Schank, Allan Collins, Donald Norman, and a number of other scholars from psychology, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy.  

 Conference creation  
 The first conference on cognitive science was held at LaJolla, California in August, 1979, and has occurred annually since then. The proceedings of each conference are published, and those from most years are available through Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. The annual proceedings of the Cognitive Science Conference represent a major source of information on new work and new ideas in the scientific study of thinking. In 1990, the Society, with help from an anonymous donor, established the David Marr Prize for the best student paper at each annual meeting.  

 Journal creation  
 The Journal, Cognitive Science, began publication in 1976, and is now published by Wiley-Blackwell. The Executive Editor is currently Richard P. Cooper of Birkbeck, University of London, and there are 18 Associate Editors and a 30-member editorial board. It serves as the premier outlet for research reports that intersect two or more disciplines. Copyrights for articles published in the journal are held by the Society. The Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society voted in late 2006 to found a new journal, Topics in Cognitive Science (topiCS). The Editor in Chief is Wayne Gray, Cognitive Science Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The journal seeks to fill a niche not occupied by Cognitive Science Journal or other cognitive science journals. Membership in the Society includes a subscription to Cognitive Science and TopiCS. Copyrights for articles published in the journal are held by the Society.  
 Historical information may be found via a search in the Massachusetts registry   .  

 Society bylaws  
 ARTICLE 1: NAME AND OBJECTIVE  
 The name of the Society is The Cognitive Science Society, Inc. The objectives of the Society are to promote Cognitive Science as a discipline and to foster scientific interchange among researchers in the Cognitive Sciences.  
  
 ARTICLE 2: MEMBERSHIP  
 Society membership is open to anyone engaged in scientific endeavors related to Cognitive Science. The Society retains the right to refuse membership to applicants for any or no reason.  
 The Governing Board will establish membership types, length & term of membership (i.e. one-year, two-year lengths, Jan 1 – Dec 31 terms), and membership dues. A member failing to pay dues shall, unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, be considered to have resigned from the Society.  
  
 ARTICLE 3: GOVERNING BOARD  
 3.1  Objective: The Governing Board shall exercise general supervision over the affairs of the Society, subject to these Bylaws, as amended from time to time. The Governing Board shall have full and plenary power to conduct all business, undertake all activities, set all policies, and otherwise govern and control the operations of the Society. The Governing Board’s powers include, without limitation, the ability to conduct, control, or direct the following activities:  
 Setting all policies and practices 
  Conducting all business regarding publications 
  Determining the composition, goals, and activities of committees 
  Establishing rules or procedures regarding membership, officers, or governance, including without limitation setting election or recall procedures 
  Supervising and directing the activities of the Executive Director or other managers, and establishing the duties of the same 
  The Governing Board has the ability and power to conduct any or all of its activities on its own behalf, or through delegates, committees, contractors, agents, or otherwise; delegated powers may be withdrawn or limited at any time at the sole discretion of the Governing Board.  
 3.2  The Governing Board shall consist of fifteen members (subject to the terms of these Bylaws), elected for staggered terms of six years each. Elected members of the Governing Board may not succeed themselves unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board or as provided in these Bylaws, such as in Sections 3.4 or 5.4. Upon request of the Governing Board, an Officer or Officers shall serve for an additional period of time on the Board as may be required to provide continuity with new Officers.  
 3.3  The Governing Board will on an ongoing basis appoint a non-voting Graduate Student Representative to the Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society, to serve a 2-year term. The Graduate Student Representative may participate in assigned committees and is expected to attend the annual meeting and Governing Board meetings.  
 3.4  Method of Election of Elected Representatives: The President is selected from among current Governing Board members and is elected by the Governing Board. Each elected President will serve for three years, where the first year is served as “President-Elect”, the second as President, and the third as “Past President”. The President may not serve two consecutive terms. The President must be a member of the Governing Board at the time he or she becomes President-Elect. The term of the President as a member of the Governing Board shall be extended if necessary, to cover the whole of their period as President-Elect, President, and Past President. The President shall preside at meetings of the Governing Board and at the Annual Business Meeting.  
 3.5  Committee Appointments: The Governing Board shall from time to time appoint such committees as it deems necessary to conduct the affairs of the Society.  
  
 ARTICLE 4: OFFICERS  
 4.1  The officers of the Society shall be (a) the President, (b) the President-Elect, (c) the Past President, (d) the Treasurer, and (e) the Executive Officer.  
 4.2  The Treasurer of the Society shall be the President of the Finance Committee. The Treasurer shall be elected by the Governing Board.  
 4.3  The Executive Officer shall be elected by the Governing Board to serve a term of three years. The Governing Board may remove the current Executive Officer by a majority vote, at any time and with termination to be effective on a date set by the Governing Board. There shall be no fixed limit on the number of terms the Executive Officer may serve. The Executive Officer shall be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Society as directed by the Governing Board. The Executive Officer is expected to attend and participate in all meetings of the Governing Board, but the Executive Officer is not a member of the Governing Board and may not vote upon any matters before the Governing Board.  
  
 ARTICLE 5: ELECTIONS  
 5.1  Once each year, the Executive Officer shall canvass the membership for nominations of members to serve on the Governing Board. A nominee must have been a member of the Society for at least 3 (not necessarily consecutive) years.  
 5.2  Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, the nominations committee of the Governing Board will select candidates for election by choosing among those nominated by the membership up to a total of three times the number of vacancies, and present the candidates in a report to the Governing Board for approval. Once the full Governing Board has approved the report of the nominations committee, the names shall be placed on an election ballot, which shall be circulated to all members.  
 5.3  Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, twenty-one (21) days after the circulation of the election ballot, the election shall be closed, and the ballots counted. The members receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected to fill the vacancies on the Governing Board. In case of ties, the then-current President of the Governing Board shall cast the deciding ballot.  
 5.4  Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, in the case of resignation, recall, or death of a member of the Governing Board, the resulting special vacancy shall be filled in conformity with Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this Article above, at the time of the next scheduled election. The special vacancies shall be filled last, with the nominees receiving the most votes filling the regular vacancies. Members elected to fill special vacancies shall only serve the unfilled term of office of that vacancy. However, those members are then eligible for re-election. In the event of a vacancy of one year or less, the Governing Board may appoint a member to serve the unfilled term.  
 5.5  Each year, if there is no non-North American member of the Governing Board whose term on the Governing Board extends beyond that year, then one seat on the Governing Board will be designated for a non-North American member, who will be elected in conformity with Sections 1, 2, and 3 above, provided that nominations and candidates shall be limited to members not residing in North America, or meeting such other criteria as the Governing Board may designate.  
  
 ARTICLE 6: ELECTION RECALL  
 Upon petition of 10% of the membership, or if otherwise approved by the Governing Board, an election will be held on proposals for the recall of one or more members of the Governing Board. A recall will be effective upon a majority vote of the members. The recalled Governing Board members shall be replaced in accordance with the election or appointment procedures prescribed in Article 5.

20. Conference COINE_0:
International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE), co-located with AAMAS 2020   
 Call for Papers   Paper Submissions   Committees   Accepted for Presentation   Technical Programme   Contact    
  
  Note:  The workshop proceedings of COIN 2017 and COINE 2020 have been published as a combined Springer LNCS volume and are available via SpringerLink  .  
 Objectives  
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.  
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a “good” society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (12 times), IJCAI, AAAI and ECAI since 2006 (see COIN Series Website  ), and produced 12 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. While operating in the tradition of the COIN workshop series, this edition of the workshop adds ethics to the workshop name and acronym as an explicit focus of the workshop, and includes governance of MAS in the workshop name to highlight this as the common objective uniting the various strands of research of interest to the workshop.  
 Note:  COINE will inherit COIN’s B-rating on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  .  
 This edition of COINE will be hosted by AAMAS 2020  and will complement the main conference program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Under its new COINE brand, this workshop will not only be of interest to its traditional sub-community of AAMAS participants (those researchers working on coordination, organisational, institutional and normative models and technologies for MAS), but also invites researchers investigating the growing field of ethical governance of MAS.

 Call for Papers  
 COINE 2020 is co-located with the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), Auckland, New Zealand, 9-13 May, 2020 (https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/)  
 Submission deadline (extended): 5th February, 2020  23rd February, 2020 (more details below)   
 Overview  
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a “good” society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (12 times), IJCAI, AAAI and ECAI since 2006 (see Workshop Series Website  ), and produced 12 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.  
 Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.  
 We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:  
 mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical and pragmatic issues related to the issues above; 
  modelling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS; 
  tools, prototypes and actual working systems; 
  experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies; 
  challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field. 
  The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration among researchers in these topics.  
 A specific emphasis of this year’s iteration of COINE lies on the response to the wider uptake of COINE technologies within and across AAMAS communities, such as social robotics and reinforcement learning. To leverage a broader understanding on how COINE-related themes are employed in these research disciplines, we will invite established researchers from the respective fields in order to highlight their perspectives on and adoption of COINE theory and technologies. Building on those insights, we will use this workshop to provide a platform to discuss the potentially varying viewpoints and facilitate the exploration of synergies as well as opportunities for cross-fertilisation across community boundaries.  
 COINE inherits COIN’s B-rating on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  . COIN holds a B4 rating by the Qualis ranking from CAPES (Brazil).

22. Conference COINE_1:
International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE), co-located with AAMAS 2023   
 Call for Papers   Paper Submissions   Committees   Accepted for Presentation   Keynote   Schedule   Contact    
  
 Workshop registration link available now 
  Schedule is avaible now 
  Notifications sent out on March 28, 2023 
  Paper submission deadline extended to March 5, 2023 (Closed) 
  Objectives  
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.  
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a “good” society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (15 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI in 2008 and ECAI in 2006 and 2016 (see COIN Series Website  ), and produced 14 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (see COIN Proceedings  ). The 15th volume of COINE post-proceedings is in progress. In 2020, ethics was added to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken. The workshop in the new format has been held three times (2020, 2021, and 2022). COINE has achieved a ranking of B on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  .  
 This edition of COINE will be hosted by AAMAS 2023  and will complement the main conference program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Under its new COINE brand, this workshop will not only be of interest to its traditional sub-community of AAMAS participants (those researchers working on coordination, organisational, institutional and normative models and technologies for MAS), but also invites researchers investigating the growing field of ethical governance of MAS.

 Overview  
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a “good” society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (12 times), IJCAI, AAAI and ECAI since 2006 (see Workshop Series Website  ), and produced 13 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.  
 Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.  
 We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:  
 mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical and pragmatic issues related to COINE; 
  modelling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS; 
  tools, prototypes and working systems; 
  experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies; 
  challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field; 
  methodologies for the development of trustworthy AI; and 
  trustworthy AI education within the scope of MAS. 
  The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration among researchers in these topics.  
 A specific emphasis of this year’s iteration of COINE lies on the response to growing interest in the concept of norms applied to social and human-centric AI, so we will also aim to establish better mutual awareness between COINE and that community by making explicit references in our scope for research in development methodologies and education of trustworthy AI.  
 To leverage a broader understanding on how COINE-related themes are employed in these research disciplines, we will invite established researchers from the respective fields in order to highlight their perspectives on and adoption of COINE theory and technologies. Building on those insights, we will use this workshop to provide a platform to discuss the potentially varying viewpoints and facilitate the exploration of synergies as well as collaborative opportunities across community boundaries.  
 COINE inherited COIN’s B-rating on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list ( http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  ). COIN holds a B4 rating by the Qualis ranking from CAPES (Brazil).  
 Important Dates  
 Paper submission: | January 30, 2023 | February 22, 2023 | March 5, 2023 (Closed) 
  Author notifications: | March 13, 2023 | March 27, 2023 | March 27, 2023 
  Camera-ready deadline: | April 3, 2023 | April 16, 2023 | April 16, 2023 
  Workshop: 29 May 2023 
  Instructions for Authors  
 For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page.  
 We solicit three types of papers in the LNCS format  :  
 Full research papers (16 pages, excluding references) 
  Short research papers (10 pages, excluding references) – These ‘early-innovation’ papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea. 
  Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2023 (see | https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/calls/blue-sky-ideas/ | ), focussing on the COINE topics 
  All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).    
 For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2023   
 Submitted papers will be reviewed on a “single-blind” basis by at least two reviewers.  
 Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work.  
 Proceedings  
 Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference. They will also be distributed to AAMAS 2023 registrants in electronic form.  
 As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer’s LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.  
 Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.

 Submission Details  
 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024 
 Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions) | October 30 - November 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025 | November 29, 2024 
 Camera-ready papers due | December 15, 2024 
 Tutorials and Workshops | January 19-20, 2025 
 Main Conference | January 21-24, 2025 
  
 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024 
 Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions) | October 30 - November 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025 | November 29, 2024

 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

 Dear colleagues, please note the CFP for IEEE CogSIMA conference.  
  2025 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA)  
  2 – 5 June 2025 | University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany  
  Sponsored by the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society  
 [IEEE CogSIMA 2025](http:/cogsima2025.org)  
  Improved Situation Awareness in Theory and Application  
 In its 15th edition, the CogSIMA conference series will take place in Germany for the very first time, in the city of Duisburg.  
  The conference will be held at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Duisburg, one of the leading academic institutions in the heart of Germany's industrial region, offering an ideal backdrop for a technical conference. CogSIMA 2025 is sponsored by the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMCS) and supported by the IEEE SMCS Technical Committees on Cognitive Situation Management and on Interactive and Wearable Computing and Devices.  
  The CogSIMA conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems – of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks – whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their situation awareness.  
  Application areas include autonomous vehicles, command and control systems, disaster monitoring and recovery systems, human-robot teams, human-AI teaming, physical and cyber security situation awareness and cyber warfare systems, intelligent transportation systems, health care medical situation control systems, and many others.  
  The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, artificial intelligence, human factors, cognitive science, modeling and simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.  
 Accepted papers and poster presentations will be submitted for publication in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library, which will be indexed by all major indexing and web discovery services (such as Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, DBLP, Semantic Scholar etc.).  
 Please consult http://cogsima2025.org  for further information and updates on our program, venue, submission guidelines and author requirements.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Situation sensing, perception, comprehension, and prediction 
  “Big Data” analysis and social media processing for situation awareness 
  Cognitive information fusion 
  Integration of human and signal intelligence, cyber-physical-social systems 
  Models of collaboration and emergent behavior in cognitive multi-agent systems 
  Situation recognition in autonomous systems and autonomous vehicles 
  Situation assessment in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning 
  Generative AI and Explainable AI for situation awareness and situated human-machine interaction 
  Cognitive Situation Management with Neuroergonomics and Brain-Machine Interface 
  Biologically-inspired computational models of situation management 
  Approaches to spatial and temporal reasoning, reasoning about goals, intentions and actions 
  Models of human-machine collaboration 
  Performance evaluation and metrics of human- machine systems including human-AI teaming 
  Ontology-based computing, context modeling and discovery, situation modeling, representation and identification 
  Systems, platforms and tools for situation awareness, situation control, and decision support 
  System-level experiments and application-specific research 
   SUBMISSION GUIDELINES AND PUBLICATION  
  Two types of paper submissions will be accepted:  
 Regular Papers (5-8 pages) that describe new results that advance the state-of-the-art. Each accepted paper will be allocated a slot for oral presentation during the conference. 
  Poster Papers (3-5 pages) that describe work in progress. Each accepted poster will be presented in a 5 min. talk in the poster session, and will be included in the final conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically by EDAS. Authors should prepare a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their full paper in 2-column style (main text in 10-point size). Please use the stylesheet templates provided by IEEE to assure that your submission is in line with the IEEE guidelines.

 Dear colleagues, please note the CFP for IEEE CogSIMA conference.  
  2025 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA)  
  2 – 5 June 2025 | University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany  
  Sponsored by the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society  
 [IEEE CogSIMA 2025](http:/cogsima2025.org)  
  Improved Situation Awareness in Theory and Application  
 In its 15th edition, the CogSIMA conference series will take place in Germany for the very first time, in the city of Duisburg.  
  The conference will be held at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Duisburg, one of the leading academic institutions in the heart of Germany's industrial region, offering an ideal backdrop for a technical conference. CogSIMA 2025 is sponsored by the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMCS) and supported by the IEEE SMCS Technical Committees on Cognitive Situation Management and on Interactive and Wearable Computing and Devices.  
  The CogSIMA conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems – of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks – whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their situation awareness.  
  Application areas include autonomous vehicles, command and control systems, disaster monitoring and recovery systems, human-robot teams, human-AI teaming, physical and cyber security situation awareness and cyber warfare systems, intelligent transportation systems, health care medical situation control systems, and many others.  
  The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, artificial intelligence, human factors, cognitive science, modeling and simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.  
 Accepted papers and poster presentations will be submitted for publication in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library, which will be indexed by all major indexing and web discovery services (such as Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, DBLP, Semantic Scholar etc.).  
 Please consult http://cogsima2025.org  for further information and updates on our program, venue, submission guidelines and author requirements.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Situation sensing, perception, comprehension, and prediction 
  “Big Data” analysis and social media processing for situation awareness 
  Cognitive information fusion 
  Integration of human and signal intelligence, cyber-physical-social systems 
  Models of collaboration and emergent behavior in cognitive multi-agent systems 
  Situation recognition in autonomous systems and autonomous vehicles 
  Situation assessment in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning 
  Generative AI and Explainable AI for situation awareness and situated human-machine interaction

 Submission Details  
 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024 
 Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions) | October 30 - November 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025 | November 29, 2024 
 Camera-ready papers due | December 15, 2024 
 Tutorials and Workshops | January 19-20, 2025 
 Main Conference | January 21-24, 2025 
  
 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.

  The Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems  book series        
 The COINE Steering Committee | Multi-agent systems are often understood as complex entities where a multitude of agents interact, usually with some intended individual or collective purpose. Such a view usually assumes some form of structure  , or set of norms  or conventions  that articulate or restrain interactions in order to make them more effective in attaining those goals, more certain for participants or more predictable. The engineering of effective regulatory mechanisms is a key problem for the design of open complex multi-agent systems.  
 In recent years, social  and organizational  aspects of agency have become a major issue in MAS research. Moreover recent applications of MAS on Web Services, Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing enforce the need for using these aspects in order to ensure social order within these environments. Openness heterogeneity, and scalability of MAS pose new demands on traditional MAS interaction models. The view of coordination  and control  has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal  and organization-centric  views as well.  
 Following a series of very successful events in the last years, the topics of coordination  , organization  , institutions  , norms  and ethics  have become an important area of research within the agent community. The overall problem of analyzing the social, legal, economic and technological dimensions of agent organizations, and the co-evolution of agent interactions, provide theoretically demanding and interdisciplinary research questions at different levels of abstraction.  
 In order to reach different research communities working in these related topics, some of the researchers that were working in the field have decided to create the COINE  workshop series. This workshop series will provide a space for the convergence of concerns and developments from MAS researchers that have been involved with these issues from the complementary perspectives of coordination, organizations institutions and norms. Aditionally, the series will facilitate and coordinate the organization of twin yearly events co-located with large international conferences, diverse in focus and geographically.

 Call for Papers  
 The 38th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2025) will take place June 30th-July 4th, 2025 in Lyon, France. We invite submissions of papers addressing theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly defined as a subject at the intersection of computer science, statistics and applied mathematics. We strongly support an inclusive view of learning theory, including fundamental theoretical aspects of learnability in various contexts, and theory that sheds light on empirical phenomena.  
 The topics include but are not limited to:  
 Design and analysis of learning algorithms 
  Statistical and computational complexity of learning 
  Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization 
  Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning 
  Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation 
  Learning geometric and topological structures in data, manifold learning 
  Active and interactive learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Online learning and decision-making 
  Interactions of learning theory with other mathematical fields 
  High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics 
  Kernel methods 
  Causality 
  Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models 
  Bayesian methods in learning 
  Game theory and learning 
  Learning with system constraints (e.g., privacy, fairness, memory communication) 
  Learning from complex data (e.g., networks, time series) 
  Learning in neuroscience, social science, economics and other subjects 
  Submissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged.  
 While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.  
 Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.  
 PAPER AWARDS  
 COLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission. The program committee may decline to make these awards, or may split them among several papers.  
 DUAL SUBMISSIONS POLICY  
 Conferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.  
 Journals: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.  
 REBUTTAL PHASE  
 As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.  
 REVIEWING PHILOSOPHY  
 We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.  
 We recommend the following video for a thoughtful discussion of such aims and related issues: IACR Distinguished Lecture: Caught in Between Theory and Practice   
 IMPORTANT DATES  
 (All dates are in 2025.)  
 Submission deadline: February 6, 5:00 PM EST 
  Author notification: On or before May 2 
  Conference dates: June 30–July 4 
   
 Submission Instructions  
 FORMATTING AND ANONYMIZATION  
 Formatting: This year, the submissions are limited to 12 PMLR formatted pages, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Please note that in a change from previous years, appendices must be uploaded as a separate file, and the main submission file is limited to 12 pages of text (excluding references).  
 All details, proofs and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, possibly in the appendices. However, the contribution, novelty and significance of submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), and so enough details, including proof details, must be provided in the main text to convince the reviewers of the submissions’ merits.  
 Anonymization: Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; in particular, submissions should NOT include author names or other identifying information. To the extent possible, you should avoid including directly identifying information in the text. You should still include all relevant references, discussion, and scientific content even if this might provide significant hints as to the authors’ identity. But you should generally refer to your own prior work in third person. Do not include acknowledgments in the submission. They can be added in the camera-ready version of accepted papers.  
 While submissions are anonymized, and author names are withheld from reviewers, they are known to the area chair overseeing the paper’s review. The assigned area chair is allowed to reveal author names to a reviewer during the rebuttal period, upon the reviewer’s request, if they deem such information is needed in ensuring a proper review.  
 Style files: Please use the following style files. The "[anon]" option in the LaTeX template should be used to suppress author names from appearing in the submission.  
 LaTeX style files and template 
  SUBMITTING YOUR PAPER  
 Papers should be submitted through CMT; the deadline for submissions is February 6, 2025, 5pm EST.  
 CMT submission site: TBD 
  Please contact the COLT program chairs if you have any questions about the policy or technical issues with the submission process.

 Call for Papers  
 The 38th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2025) will take place June 30th-July 4th, 2025 in Lyon, France. We invite submissions of papers addressing theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly defined as a subject at the intersection of computer science, statistics and applied mathematics. We strongly support an inclusive view of learning theory, including fundamental theoretical aspects of learnability in various contexts, and theory that sheds light on empirical phenomena.  
 The topics include but are not limited to:  
 Design and analysis of learning algorithms 
  Statistical and computational complexity of learning 
  Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization 
  Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning 
  Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation 
  Learning geometric and topological structures in data, manifold learning 
  Active and interactive learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Online learning and decision-making 
  Interactions of learning theory with other mathematical fields 
  High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics 
  Kernel methods 
  Causality 
  Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models 
  Bayesian methods in learning 
  Game theory and learning 
  Learning with system constraints (e.g., privacy, fairness, memory communication) 
  Learning from complex data (e.g., networks, time series) 
  Learning in neuroscience, social science, economics and other subjects 
  Submissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged.  
 While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.  
 Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.  
 PAPER AWARDS  
 COLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission. The program committee may decline to make these awards, or may split them among several papers.  
 DUAL SUBMISSIONS POLICY  
 Conferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.  
 Journals: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.  
 REBUTTAL PHASE  
 As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.  
 REVIEWING PHILOSOPHY  
 We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.  
 We recommend the following video for a thoughtful discussion of such aims and related issues: IACR Distinguished Lecture: Caught in Between Theory and Practice   
 IMPORTANT DATES  
 (All dates are in 2025.)  
 Submission deadline: February 6, 5:00 PM EST 
  Author notification: On or before May 2 
  Conference dates: June 30–July 4 
   
 Submission Instructions  
 FORMATTING AND ANONYMIZATION  
 Formatting: This year, the submissions are limited to 12 PMLR formatted pages, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Please note that in a change from previous years, appendices must be uploaded as a separate file, and the main submission file is limited to 12 pages of text (excluding references).  
 All details, proofs and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, possibly in the appendices. However, the contribution, novelty and significance of submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), and so enough details, including proof details, must be provided in the main text to convince the reviewers of the submissions’ merits.  
 Anonymization: Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; in particular, submissions should NOT include author names or other identifying information. To the extent possible, you should avoid including directly identifying information in the text. You should still include all relevant references, discussion, and scientific content even if this might provide significant hints as to the authors’ identity. But you should generally refer to your own prior work in third person. Do not include acknowledgments in the submission. They can be added in the camera-ready version of accepted papers.  
 While submissions are anonymized, and author names are withheld from reviewers, they are known to the area chair overseeing the paper’s review. The assigned area chair is allowed to reveal author names to a reviewer during the rebuttal period, upon the reviewer’s request, if they deem such information is needed in ensuring a proper review.  
 Style files: Please use the following style files. The "[anon]" option in the LaTeX template should be used to suppress author names from appearing in the submission.  
 LaTeX style files and template 
  SUBMITTING YOUR PAPER  
 Papers should be submitted through CMT; the deadline for submissions is February 6, 2025, 5pm EST.  
 CMT submission site: TBD 
  Please contact the COLT program chairs if you have any questions about the policy or technical issues with the submission process.

  About CollaborateCom 2024   
 Many organizations and individuals have relied on electronic collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce joint products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators. Technology has evolved from standalone tools, to open systems supporting collaboration in multi-organizational settings, and from general-purpose tools to specialized collaboration grids. Future collaboration solutions that fully realize the promises of electronic collaboration require advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction paradigms, and interoperation with application-specific components and tools.  
  The 20th International Conference on Collaborative Computing (CollaborateCom 2024) will be held in Wuzhen, China, and will continue to serve as a premier international forum for discussion among academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, and students interested in collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications.

 5th IMA and OR Society Conference on Mathematics of Operational Research  
   
 Building on the success of the four previous conferences (held in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) this biennial event will aim to draw together the considerable community of researchers and practitioners who use and / or develop innovative mathematics and data driven approaches, relevant to the applications and theory of Operational Research (OR).  
 The conference will be held at the beautiful and easily accessible Conference Centre Aston in Birmingham and will showcase activities from across all areas of OR. We welcome contributions that are empirically motivated and with a focus on application, as well as those that are theoretically driven. The conference will host plenaries from leading international experts, sessions of themed talks, as well as poster sessions, and will provide plenty of opportunities for networking. We look forward to seeing you in Birmingham in April 2025 for a terrific event and to celebrate together the successes of OR!  
 EDI   
  The IMA, the OR Society, and the conference committee strongly support diversity and inclusion. It is our intention to host a conference that is welcoming and inclusive for all, and we will be making active efforts to support the participation of individuals and groups who are under-represented at such academic events and in our discipline more broadly.  
  As part of improving understanding amongst the OR community of the different barriers individuals face, we would like to invite session leaders and individual speakers to include as part of their presentation(s) their own experiences of achievement, inclusion, and exclusion. This will be complemented with a number of focused sessions with key speakers on the particular challenges faced by different groups.  
  A pack for delegates will include details on the venue’s accessibility, baby changing facilities and the nearby Martin Luther King multi-faith prayer centre. We will also include information to signpost details on local creches, transport links, and other local amenities. We also welcome special requests and suggestions, and will accommodate them where possible.  
 Call for session organisation

 Call For Paper (CFP) Description  
 The 38th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2025) will take place June 30th-July 4th, 2025 in Lyon, France. We invite submissions of papers addressing theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly defined as a subject at the intersection of computer science, statistics and applied mathematics. We strongly support an inclusive view of learning theory, including fundamental theoretical aspects of learnability in various contexts, and theory that sheds light on empirical phenomena.  
   
  The topics include but are not limited to:  
   
  Design and analysis of learning algorithms  
  Statistical and computational complexity of learning  
  Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization  
  Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning  
  Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning  
  Supervised learning  
  Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation  
  Learning geometric and topological structures in data, manifold learning  
  Active and interactive learning  
  Reinforcement learning  
  Online learning and decision-making  
  Interactions of learning theory with other mathematical fields  
  High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics  
  Kernel methods  
  Causality  
  Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models  
  Bayesian methods in learning  
  Game theory and learning  
  Learning with system constraints (e.g., privacy, fairness, memory, communication)  
  Learning from complex data (e.g., networks, time series)  
  Learning in neuroscience, social science, economics and other subjects  
  Submissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged.  
   
  While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.  
   
  Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.

  Journals: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.  
   
  REBUTTAL PHASE  
  As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.  
   
  REVIEWING PHILOSOPHY  
  We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.  
   
  We recommend the following video for a thoughtful discussion of such aims and related issues: IACR Distinguished Lecture: Caught in Between Theory and Practice

 Call for Research Track Papers  

 Research Track  
 Effective Jan 1 2024, the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) has a new policy. See this page  to learn about its implications on CODS-COMAD authors.  
   
 We invite the submission of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in the areas of data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation and results of solutions of such advances to real-world problems. Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking. We invite two types of submissions:  
 Full papers: 8 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  Short papers: 4 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  The goal of the short papers is to provide a venue for innovative ideas such as engineered solutions, exciting work-in-progress or even negative results that would be interesting to the broader community. The review process will take place in two stages.  
 In the first stage of the review, papers will be grouped as Accept, Major Revision or Reject. 
  In the second stage of the review, authors can revise and resubmit Major Revision papers. They will then be regrouped as Accept or Reject. 
  Authors of accepted full papers must present their work as both a talk and a poster at the conference; accepted short papers must present their work as a poster. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 AI, ML, and Data Mining: | Classification and regression; Knowledge discovery; knowledge representation and knowledge-based systems; data preprocessing and wrangling; feature engineering; reinforcement learning; deep learning; Bayesian methods; time series analysis; optimization; graphical models; statistical relational learning; matrix and tensor methods; parallel and distributed learning; semi- and unsupervised learning; graph mining; network analytics; text analytics and NLP; information retrieval; learning-based computer vision; multimodal learning and analytics; human-in-the-loop learning; planning and reasoning; ML for mobiles and other resource-constrained environments; federated learning; AutoML; causality; weak supervision and data augmentation; new benchmark tasks and datasets for AI/ML/data mining. 
  Data Management: | Data management systems (subtopics including but not limited to benchmarking, monitoring, testing, and tuning database systems, cloud, distributed, decentralized and parallel data management, database systems on emerging hardware, embedded databases, IoT and Sensor networks, Storage, indexing, and physical database design, Query processing and optimization, Transaction processing, Data warehousing, OLAP, Analytics); Models and Languages (subtopics including but not limited to Data models and semantics, Declarative programming languages and optimization, Spatial and temporal data management, Graphs, social networks, web data, and semantic web, Multimedia and information retrieval, Uncertain, probabilistic, and approximate databases, Streams and complex event processing); Human-Centric Data Management (subtopics including but not limited to Data exploration, visualization, query languages, and user interfaces, Crowdsourced and collaborative data management, User-centric and human-in-the-loop data management, Natural language processing for databases); Data Governance (subtopics including but not limited to Data provenance and workflows, Data integration, information extraction, and schema matching, Data quality, data cleaning, Data security, privacy, and access control, Responsible data management and data fairness, Metadata Management). 
  Intersection of AI & Data Management: | Structured queries over unstructured data: images, video, natural language, natural language queries; machine learning methods for database engine internals; machine learning methods for database tuning; data management and metadata for machine learning pipelines; knowledge base management. 
  Data Science Ethics: | Subtopics including, but not limited to quantifying and mitigating fairness and bias issues; improving model trust, transparency and explainability; data privacy; model alignment; environmental costs; governance and regulation. 
  Sharing and Reproducibility  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative). Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.  
 Please read the Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest policies  before finalising your submission.  
 Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. Please see the Awards page  for details.  
 Partial travel Grants will be available for students (both domestic and international) whose papers are accepted.  
 Double Anonymity Requirement  
 CODS-COMAD 2025 will be using double-anonymous reviewing for Research Track papers (but not the ADS Track papers). Please review the instructions below carefully.  
 Authors’ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or anywhere else in the submission. Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. The file names of any documents submitted must not identify the authors of the submission. Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors’ names in the submission’s associated metadata. Only after acceptance at the camera-ready stage should the author list, acknowledgments, and funding sources be added to the paper.  
 To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to CODS-COMAD.  
 Be careful when referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. Authors must refer to their own past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity. Do not omit referring to your own past related work because that could reveal your identity by negation. Limit self-references to only the essential ones. Extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced. Many ACM conferences have successfully followed double anonymity for decades to offer more equity for all authors in the reviewing process. Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving double anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. It is the responsibility of the authors to do their very best to preserve double anonymity.  
 Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to Desk Rejection.  
 Important dates

  About CollaborateCom 2020   
 Over the last two decades, many organizations and individuals have relied on electronic collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce joint products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators. Technology has evolved from standalone tools, to open systems supporting collaboration in multi-organizational settings, and from general-purpose tools to specialized collaboration grids. Future collaboration solutions that fully realize the promises of electronic collaboration require advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction paradigms, and interoperation with application-specific components and tools.  
 The 16th International Conference on Collaborative Computing (CollaborateCom 2020) will be held in Shanghai, People’s Republic of China, and will continue to serve as a premier international forum for discussion among academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, and students interested in collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications.

 CAP  andrewthompson    2024-11-30T04:41:57+00:00  COMPSAC 2025 Symposium on Computer Architecture & Platforms (CAP)  

 The Computer Architecture & Platforms Symposium (CAP) aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners that study and build computer systems consisting of disparate components, using different metrics and methods, but providing synergetic effects. These systems usually act as reusable supporting platforms for a wide range of applications, potentially restricted by specific domains.   
   
 CAP is uniquely positioned within COMPSAC to address relevant topics related to the conception, design, deployment and utilization of a variety of architectures and platforms – from mobile to networked data centers. Non-limiting topics include:   
 requirements analysis 
  co-analysis, co-design and co-verification 
  modeling, design, development, testing, measurement, verification and validation for function, performance, safety, security, and dependability constraints of cyber-physical systems and networked systems. 
  The effective construction of computing systems is not restricted solely to the field of computer science and engineering, but it is truly a multidisciplinary effort. Multidisciplinary work, research and development of software prototypes, industry-university collaborations, all based on emerging and critical concepts and technologies are of particular interest to this symposium

  information about previously organized workshops (if any) 
  Please use the proposal template  to create your proposal and submit it through EasyChair by October 15, 2024  .  
 Workshop Paper Reviewing Process and Event Promotion  
 Every submitted workshop paper is reviewed by three  reviewers from the workshop’s PC that are assigned by the workshop organizers. Organizers of the accepted workshops are responsible for promoting and advertising their workshops on mailing lists and personal professional networks with proper reference to COMPSAC 2025.  
 Workshop Organizers’ Responsibility  
 Workshop organizers should organize their workshops under the direction of the COMPSAC workshop chairs. The responsibilities of the workshop organizers include (i) distributing a Call For Papers on appropriate mailing lists and to relevant research groups, (ii) updating the workshop’s webpage when needed (with the help of the COMPSAC webmaster), (iii) configuring the workshop’s paper submission system (with the help of the COMPSAC General Chair and team), and most importantly (iv) ensuring that the accepted papers are of high quality while striving for an acceptance ratio of less than 70%.  
 Workshop Paper Handling  
 COMPSAC 2025 uses a web-based paper review system. Workshops must use the same system for paper review. COMPSAC workshop chairs are responsible for configuring the dedicated workshop review system, adding the workshop organizers and inviting PC members to the workshop’s review system. Workshop papers must be processed as follows:  
 Workshop organizers have to invite PC members on the review system before their workshop papers submission opens. 
  Workshop authors submit papers to the corresponding workshop. 
  Workshop papers are limited up to 6 pages (without additional charge). Extra up to 2 pages can be added (with additional charge). 
  Workshop organizers start the paper reviewing process by assigning papers to PC members. (At least | three | reviewers must be assigned to each submitted paper.) Each reviewer reports evaluation with detailed comments. 
  Some main symposia papers, rejected from the main symposia but identified as having high enough quality and being worthy of discussion in the workshop, will be transferred to the relevant workshop. The transferred papers are already accepted and do not receive any further reviews. Workshop organizers have to accept all of these transferred papers except the case when the scope of the paper does not match to the workshop. The author of the paper may decline to be accepted as a workshop paper. 
  Workshop organizers provide a list of accepted and rejected papers (i.e., paper title, author name[s], author email address[es], and a short justification of why the paper has been accepted/rejected) to the COMPSAC workshop chairs. 
  Workshop chairs (not Workshop organizers) send notifications of accept/reject decisions to the authors and IEEE Computer Society Press sends an | Author’s Kit | to the authors of accepted workshop papers. 
  Workshop authors make author registration and send their camera-ready papers to the IEEE Computer Society according to an instruction in the | Author’s Kit | . 
  The IEEE Computer Society publishes the papers as conference proceedings. 
  Workshop organizers send a workshop program (i.e., timetable, session names, session chairs, paper titles, and name[s] of author[s]) to the COMPSAC workshop chairs. Such information will be included in the final COMPSAC Program. 
  Each accepted paper is allocated a time slot to present during the workshop sessions. Registering for and presenting the paper in the workshop is obligatory for inclusion in the workshop proceedings. Presented papers will be included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Workshop organizers have to report to the COMPSAC workshop chairs whether all papers in the workshop sessions have been presented or not. 
  Invited Speakers  
 Workshop organizers can organize invited talks, panels, etc. for their workshop. Note that there is no travel grant nor registration fee discount for such invited speakers. The following rules must be followed for the invited speakers.  
 Invited speaker is allowed to be included in the program only when there are 5 or more (non-invited) submissions for the workshop. 
  Invited speaker with full-paper is required full-registration and review process. 
  Invited speaker with two (at least one) pages abstract is required full-registration. 
  Invited speaker (without abstract) may participate with one-day registration (The name will appear only on the conference program.)
