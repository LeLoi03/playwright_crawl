 Call for Papers  
 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
  (PADL 2025)  
 PADL 2025 – : The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages – POPL 2025 (sigplan.org)   
 Denver, Colorado, United States, January 20-21, 2025   
 Co-located with ACM POPL 2025   
 Conference Description  
 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming.  
 Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
  Practical applications of theoretical results 
  New language developments and their impact on applications 
  Declarative languages and software engineering 
  Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
  Practical experiences and industrial applications 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages.  
 PADL 2025 will take place on January 20th and 21st, 2025, as a physical (in-person) event. For each accepted paper at least one author is required to register for the conference and present the paper in person.  
 Important Dates  
 Abstract submission: October 4, 2024 (AoE) 
  Paper submission: October 11, 2024 (AoE) 
  Notification: November 11, 2024 
  Symposium: January 20-21, 2025 
  Submissions  
 PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. 15 pages) and short papers (max. 8 pages) that describe original and previously unpublished research results on  
 complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages, 
  tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages, 
  technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. 
  Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.  
 PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. 3 pages) on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication.  
 Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.  
 All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see  
 Conference Proceedings guidelines | Springer | Springer — International Publisher   
 The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version -for example, details of proofs- may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit.  
 Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
 \usepackage{lineno}  
 \linenumbers  
 The conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Previous PADL proceedings can be found on SpringerLink.  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via EquinOCS (registration is required if you do not have an account): EquinOCS (springernature.com)   
 Distinguished Papers  
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP). The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.

 SUBMISSION DETAILS  
 All submissions must be written in English. Papers accepted at ICLP may appear either in  
 The ICLP 24 Technical Communication Proceedings published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). EPTCS format is described at http://style.eptcs.org 
  The journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP): (the deadline for this kind of submissions has already expired) 
  All accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Authors of accepted papers will by default be automatically included in the list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic Programming Newsletter at no cost. The forms of submission are as follows.  
 Main and Application Tracks: | All papers must describe original, previously unpublished research, and must not simultaneously be submitted for publication elsewhere. (These restrictions do not apply to previously accepted workshop papers with a limited audience and/or without archival proceedings.) Main and Application track submissions may have one of two forms: | Short papers (7 pages in EPTCS format, including references). The accepted short papers will be published in the Technical Communication Proceedings. 
  Regular papers in TPLP format: the deadline for this submission form is now expired. 
  Recently Published Research Track: | We invite extended abstracts describing previously published research (from January 2022 onwards) in selective journals and conferences, that has not been previously presented at ICLP. The extended abstract should be 2-3 pages in EPTCS format and accompanied by a title page with (i) details on where the original paper appeared, (ii) a link to the original paper, (iii) a paragraph describing why the authors believe this work warrants a presentation at ICLP. The extended abstracts will be published in the Technical Communication Proceedings. 
  System Demonstrations: | We invite extended abstracts (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format) describing systems to be demonstrated in a session of ICLP. System demonstrations should provide highlights of the novel features of the system, along with information about how to access it. Accepted abstracts will be published in the Technical Communication Proceedings. 
  Birds of a Feather (BoF) Proposals: | Finally we invite extended abstracts (2-3 pages in EPTCS format) that propose breakout sessions that may take place during the ICLP 24 conference. BOF proposals should motivate the relevance of the topic to logic programming, describe the expected audience, identify discussion leaders and their expertise, and provide a brief description of the activities during the session. BoF proposals should also discribe the planned practices to promote inclusion and to foster attendee involvement. Accepted abstracts will be published in the Technical Communication Proceedings. 
  Submissions will be made via EasyChair. The submission Web page for ICLP2023 is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp2024

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Submissions will be double blind: reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, and authors cannot see reviewer names. Having papers on arxiv is allowed per the dual submission policy outlined below.  
 We use OpenReview  to host papers and allow for public discussions that can be seen by all, comments that are posted by reviewers will remain anonymous. The program will include oral presentations and posters of accepted papers.  
 Authors can revise their paper as many times as needed up to the paper submission deadline. Changes to the paper will not be allowed while the paper is being reviewed. During the discussion phase (between area chairs, reviewers and authors), edits will again be allowed; a pdfdiff  will be done against the submission at the paper submission deadline. Authors are encouraged to be explicit and precise about changes to the paper in their response to reviews. Area chairs and reviewers reserve the right to ignore changes that are significant from the original scope of the paper.  
 As in past years, workshops will have their own organization and call for contributions.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Authors must submit paper abstracts by the abstract submission deadline of Sept 27, 2024. Please note that no changes on the authors and their orders can be made after the abstract submission deadline. Also, please make sure that all authors have an OpenReview profile with the latest information. Abstracts submitted by the abstract submission deadline must be genuine; placeholder or duplicate abstracts will be removed.  
 The full paper submission deadline is Oct 1, 2024 11:59pm AOE. Abstracts and papers must be submitted using the conference submission system at:  https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference  . The submission site will be open on September 13, 2024. Supplementary material is due at the same time as the main paper.  
 Paper length   
 New this year, the main text must be between 6 and 10 pages (inclusive). This limit will be strictly enforced. Papers with main text on the 11th page will be desk rejected. The page limit applies to both the initial and final camera ready version.  
 We encourage authors to be crisp in their writing by submitting papers with 9 pages of main text. We recommend that authors only use the longer page limit in order to include larger and more detailed figures. However, authors are free to use the pages as they wish, as long as they obey the page limits.  
 The list of references does not count towards the page limit, and unlimited additional pages are allowed for the bibliography/references.  
 Authors may use as many pages of appendices (after the bibliography) as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix.  
 Style files and Templates   
 To prepare your submission to ICLR 2025, please use the LaTeX style files provided at:  
 https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2025.zip   
 Authors are strongly encouraged to participate in the public discussion of their paper, as well as of any other paper submitted to the conference. Submissions and reviews are both anonymous. For detailed instructions about the format of the paper, please visit www.iclr.cc  .  
 Reviewing Process   
 Submissions to ICLR are uploaded on OpenReview, which enables public discussion. Official reviews are anonymous and publicly visible. During the public discussion phase, anybody who is logged in can post comments that are publicly visible, or restrict visibility to reviewers and up, ACs and up, or just PCs. In addition, the author of a comment can decide to post anonymously or not. Login is required before posting any comment. 
  Once reviews have been posted, authors are encouraged to revise their paper until the paper submission deadline. Authors can participate in the discussion about their paper, as well as about any other paper submitted to the conference, at any time. 
  Full reviews are posted by Nov 12. Reviews are anonymous and publicly visible in OpenReview. Once the reviews are posted, authors are free to upload modifications to the paper during the discussion period. 
  During the discussion period, if you choose to update the submission, a | pdfdiff | will be applied to compare new changes to the paper against the original submission. Area chairs and reviewers reserve the right to ignore changes that are significantly different from the original paper. In addition, during this period, any submission that is cited will be given an anonymous BibTex entry. 
  After discussion there will be an internal discussion period amongst reviewers and ACs with the aim of summarizing the review process, after which acceptance decisions are made. Papers that are not accepted will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not), although the OpenReview site will maintain the reviews, the comments, and links to the versions submitted to ICLR. 
  All submitted papers (accepted or rejected) will be deanonymized after the notification. The submissions and reviews will be released to the public. 
  Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement   
 New this year, there is a requirement for authors to serve as reviewers based on the number of papers they submit.  
 All authors who are on 3 or more papers must serve as a reviewer for at least 6 papers. Authors in this category that fail to finish reviews by rebuttal stage may have their paper submissions desk rejected. Authors are exempt from the reviewing requirement if they are serving as an AC, SAC, or another organizing chair for ICLR 2025. 
  In addition, all submissions must have at least one author who is registered to review at least 3 papers. The registered reviewer should be qualified to review, and they are qualified if they have at least one accepted publication at a previous ICLR/NeurIPS/ICML conference or equivalent journal. If none of the authors are qualified under this definition, then they are exempt from this requirement. We encourage submissions from researchers new to ICLR. 
  All authors will be notified to register as reviewers after the abstract deadline. If none of the authors are registered as a reviewer, it will result in desk rejection for the paper. The program chairs may grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis.  
 Code of Conduct   
 All ICLR participants, including authors, are required to adhere to the ICLR code of conduct ( https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct  ). More detailed guidance for authors, reviewers, and all other participants will be made available in due course, and participation will require acknowledging and adhering to the provided guidelines.  
 Code of Ethics   
 All ICLR participants, including authors, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics ( https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics  ). All authors of submitted papers are required to read the Code of Ethics, adhere to it, and explicitly acknowledge this during the submission process. The Code of Ethics applies to all conference participation, including paper submission, reviewing, and paper discussion.  
 Dual Submission Policy   
 Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to this or other conferences or journals, are not allowed and violate our dual submission policy. However, papers that cite previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non-peer reviewed websites (like arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have publication proceedings) do not violate the policy. The policy is enforced during the whole reviewing process period. Submission of the paper to archival repositories such as arXiv is allowed during the review period.  
 To allow citation of papers that are under review at ICLR2025, OpenReview provides BibTeX entries that do not list the authors, but does give the title, year and url. Author names are revealed at the end of the conference.  
 The Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)   
 The use of LLMs is allowed as a general-purpose assist tool. Authors and reviewers should understand that they take full responsibility for the contents written under their name, including content generated by LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts). LLMs are not eligible for authorship.  
 Withdrawal Policy   
 Authors have the right to withdraw papers from consideration at any time until paper notification. Before the paper submission deadline, if an author withdraws the paper it will be deleted from the OpenReview hosting site. However, note that after the paper submission deadline, if an author chooses to withdraw a submission, it will remain hosted by OpenReview in a publicly visible "withdrawn papers" section. Like on arXiv, submissions to ICLR cannot be deleted or modified. Withdrawn papers will be de-anonymized immediately.

 DEAR ICMI COMMUNITY,   
 We are thrilled to welcome you in-person in Costa Rica  . This year ICMI and the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing ( CSCW  ) will be held back-to-back in the same city!  
 The 26th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2024) will be held in San José, Costa Rica. ICMI is the premier international forum that brings together multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction research. Multimodal AI encompasses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modeling such as representations, fusion, data, and systems. The study of social interactions englobes both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values scientific discoveries and technical modeling achievements equally, with an eye toward impactful applications for the good of people and society.   
 We are keen to showcase novel input and output modalities and interactions to the ICMI community. ICMI 2024 will feature a single-track main conference which includes: keynote speakers, technical full and short papers (including oral and poster presentations), demonstrations, exhibits, doctoral spotlight papers, and late-breaking papers. The conference will also feature workshops and grand challenges. The proceedings of all ICMI 2024 papers, including Long and Short Papers, will be published by ACM as part of their series of International Conference Proceedings and Digital Library, and the adjunct proceedings will feature the workshop papers.

  Welcome to the ICMLA'24 Official Web Site     
   
  ICMLA'24 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML).  
 The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML, with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges. The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments, games, are especially encouraged.  
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The conference is technically co-sponsored by IEEE.  
 It is planned that ICMLA'24 will be organized as in pre-pandemics time, with participants attending the conference in person, unless Covid rules will change towards the end of the year and this will not be possible. However, facilities will be in place so that people can attend and present their papers online, although we encourage in-person attendance. For online presentation, the authors must select Main Conference Track 2 (MC2) at the time of submitting the papers. Submission of papers in all other tracks requires in-person presentation. Change of mode of presentation from in-person to online and viceversa will not be permitted.

ICMI is the premier international forum that brings together multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction research. Multimodal AI encompasses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modeling such as representations, fusion, data, and systems. The study of social interactions encompasses both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values both scientific discoveries and technical modeling achievements, with an eye towards impactful applications for the good of people and society. Novelty will be assessed along two dimensions: scientific novelty and technical novelty. Accepted papers at ICMI 2024 will need to be novel along one of the two dimensions: Scientific Novelty: Papers should bring new scientific knowledge about human social interactions, including human-computer interactions. For example, discovering new behavioral markers that are predictive of mental health or how new behavioral patterns relate to children’s interactions during learning. It is the responsibility of the authors to perform a proper literature review and clearly discuss the novelty in the scientific discoveries made in their paper. Technical Novelty: Papers should propose novelty in their computational approach for recognizing, generating or modeling multimodal data. Examples include: novelty in the learning and prediction algorithms, in the neural architecture, or in the data representation. Novelty can also be associated with new usages of an existing approach. Commitment to ethical conduct is required and submissions must adhere to ethical standards in particular when human-derived data are employed. Authors are encouraged to read the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (https://ethics.acm.org/). ICMI 2024 conference theme: The theme of this year’s ICMI conference revolves around “Equitability and environmental sustainability in multimodal interaction technologies.” The focus is on exploring how multimodal systems and multimodal interactive applications can serve as tools to bridge the digital divide, particularly in underserved communities and countries, with a specific emphasis on those in Latin America and the Caribbean. The conference aims to delve into the design principles that can render multimodal systems more equitable and sustainable in applications such as health and education, thereby catalyzing positive transformations in development for historically marginalized groups, including racial/ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples. Moreover, there is a crucial exploration of the intersection between multimodal interaction technologies and environmental sustainability. This involves examining how these technologies can be crafted to comprehend, disseminate, and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change, especially in the Latin America and Caribbean region. The conference endeavors to explore the potential of multimodal systems in fostering community resilience, raising awareness, and facilitating education related to climate change, thereby contributing to a holistic approach that encompasses both social and environmental dimensions. Additional topics of interest include but are not limited to: Affective computing and interaction Cognitive modeling and multimodal interaction Gesture, touch and haptics Healthcare, assistive technologies Human communication dynamics Human-robot/agent multimodal interaction Human-centered A.I. and ethics Interaction with smart environment Machine learning for multimodal interaction Mobile multimodal systems Multimodal behaviour generation Multimodal datasets and validation Multimodal dialogue modeling Multimodal fusion and representation Multimodal interactive applications Novel multimodal datasets Speech behaviours in social interaction System components and multimodal platforms Visual behaviours in social interaction Virtual/augmented reality and multimodal interaction  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-03-03

 WELCOME TO IPMV 2025   
 2025 7th International Conference on Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV 2025) will be held in Hong Kong, China on January 10-12, 2025, co-sponsored by Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong and University of Macau.   
 Image Processing and Machine Vision usually plays an important role in the transition from data storage to decision systems based on large databases of signals such as the obtained from sensor networks, internet services, or communication systems. These systems imply developing both computational solutions and novel models. Signals from real-world systems are usually complex such as speech, music, bio-medical, multimedia, among others. Thus, Image Processing and Machine Vision techniques are very useful for these type of systems to automate processing and analysis techniques to retrieve information from data storage.  
 IPMV is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars, professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster working relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It will put special emphasis on the participations of PhD students, Postdoctoral fellows and other young researchers from all over the world. It would be beneficial to bring together a group of experts from diverse fields to discuss recent progress and to share ideas on open questions.  
 You are invited to submit a paper for consideration all over the globe interested in the areas of machine learning methods/ algorithms, signal processing theory and methods, data mining, artificial intelligence, optimization and applications to human brain disorders like epilepsy etc. Other applications of image processing and machine vision techniques are also welcome. Looking forward to welcoming you in Hong Kong!  

 Important DATES:   

 Submission Deadline: November 20, 2024    
 Notification Date: December 10, 2024

 Important Dates  

 Paper submission deadline: Feb 16, 2025. For more dates, c heck out here.    

 Review Style  

 ACM ICMR follows a double-blind review process for full paper selection. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s). Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors:   
 Do not put your names under the title, 
  Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors, 
  Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs), 
  Check supplemental material for information that may identify the authors’ identity, 
  Avoid providing links to Websites that identify the authors. 

 Abstract and Keywords  

 The abstract and the keywords form the primary source for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.   

 Submission Instructions  

 See the  Paper Submission   section.   

 Presentation Format  

 ACM ICMR 2025 will be an in-person event. All oral talks and demonstrations must be on-site at the conference venue, otherwise they will be removed from the proceedings and no refund given. This includes full papers, BNI papers and doctoral symposium papers. Posters should be presented at the conference, but we will also facilitate online posters using our online conference platform. This platform requires the upload of a poster and short accompanying video. We will be strictly enforcing this policy across all submission types.

  ICML 2025 Call For Papers   
  
  The 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025) will be held in Vancouver, Canada, July 13–19, and is planned to be an in-person conference. In addition to the main conference sessions, the conference will include       tutorials         ,       workshops         , and an       expo         .        
 We invite submissions of papers on original and rigorous research of significant interest to the machine learning community for the main conference proceedings. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process and accepted papers will be presented at the conference.       Papers must be prepared and submitted as a single file: 8 pages for the main paper, with unlimited pages for references, the impact statement, and appendices.       There will be no separate deadline for the submission of supplementary material. The final versions of accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main paper. We require that, barring exceptional circumstances,       at least one of the authors of accepted papers attend the conference in person to present the paper       .        
 See information on    Author Instructions     (coming soon),    Style Files      and an and an       Example Paper  .        . Submitted papers that do not conform to these policies will be rejected without review.        
 Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):        
 General Machine Learning (active learning, clustering, online learning, ranking, supervised, semi- and self-supervised learning, time series analysis, etc.) 
  Deep Learning (architectures, generative models, theory, etc.) 
  Evaluation (methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop) 
  Theory of Machine Learning (statistical learning theory, bandits, game theory, decision theory, etc.) 
  Machine Learning Systems (e.g., improved implementation and scalability, hardware, libraries, distributed methods) 
  Optimization (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, stochastic, online, non-smooth, composite, etc.) 
  Probabilistic Methods (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.) 
  Reinforcement Learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics) 
  Trustworthy Machine Learning (causality, fairness, interpretability, privacy, robustness, safety, etc.) 
  Application-Driven Machine Learning (innovative techniques, problems, and datasets that are of interest to the machine learning community and driven by the needs of end-users in applications such as healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability and climate, etc.) 
  Similar to last year, we also invite submissions of position papers. Please review the       call for position papers         ; submissions will be handled separately from research paper submissions.        
 Papers published at ICML are indexed in the       Proceedings of Machine Learning Research         through the Journal of Machine Learning Research.        
  
 Important Dates and Submission Site        
 Submission site open: January 9, 2025. 
  Suggested OpenReview account creation deadline: January 9, 2025. (If you do not already have an OpenReview account, please register by this date, otherwise we cannot guarantee that your account will be activated in time.**) 
  Abstract submission deadline: January 23, 2025 | AoE | (Jan 24 2025 12 Noon UTC-0). 
  Full paper submission deadline: January 30, 2025 | AoE | (Jan 31 2025 12 Noon UTC-0). 
  Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview:       https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Conference                
 Note: position papers       should be submitted through a separate OpenReview site, as outlined in the Call for Position Papers  .   
 **OpenReview:             All authors must have an OpenReview account. It is strongly recommended that you sign-up for OpenReview (or associate your existing account) with an institutional email.       If you sign up for OpenReview with an institutional email your account will be activated immediately; otherwise it can take up to 2 weeks for your account to be activated.        

 Policies        
 Deadlines:        
 Abstract and paper submission deadlines are strict. In no circumstances will extensions be given.        
 Changes to abstract/title/authorship:        
 Authors should include a full title for their paper, complete author list, and complete abstract in the submission form by the abstract submission deadline. While it is possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts that are substantially rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration.        
 The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline.       After the abstract deadline, authors may be reordered, but any additions or removals must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs. Approval will be granted only in exceptional circumstances.        
 Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement:        
 New this year: Qualified authors are required to review for ICML, according to the policies below.        
 All submissions must have at least one author who is registered to review for ICML. The registered reviewer should be qualified to review according to the definition given | in the Peer Review FAQ | . If none of the authors are qualified under this definition, or if all of the authors are serving as SACs, ACs, or in other organizing roles for ICML 2025, then the submission is exempt from this requirement. Exemptions may be indicated at the time of the abstract submission. 
  Additionally, every author with 4 or more submissions must serve as a reviewer for ICML. Authors are exempt from this requirement if they are serving as an AC, SAC, or in other organizing roles for ICML 2025. 
  Authors may register as a reviewer by filling out the | self-nomination form | . 
  Submissions that do not meet this reciprocal review requirement may be desk rejected. Additionally, reviewers who fail to adequately participate in the review process (e.g., not submitting reviews on time or submitting highly insufficient or inappropriate reviews) may have their own submissions desk rejected.        
 Double-Blind Review:        
 All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy.        
 Authors are allowed to post versions of their work on preprint servers such as arXiv. They are also allowed to give talks on the work(s) submitted to ICML during the review. However, under no circumstances should the work be advertised as an ICML submission at any time during the review period, i.e., from the time the authors submit the paper to the communication of the accept/reject decisions. If the authors have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of the paper online before the ICML decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version.        
 Dual Submission:        
 Authors may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar, to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the proceedings.       Any concurrent ICML submissions with an overlapping set of authors will also be treated as prior work (so, for example, if publishing one would render the other too incremental, then this may be considered grounds for rejection).        Note that submissions that have been or are being presented at workshops without published proceedings do not violate the dual-submission policy.        
 Reviewing Criteria:        
 Submissions should report original and rigorous research of significant interest to the machine learning community. All claims must be clearly stated and supported by reproducible experiments and/or sound theoretical analysis. The contributions must be situated in context of the broader scientific and machine learning research literature, acknowledging and differentiating from relevant prior works as appropriate. See       reviewer instructions         for more information.        
 Use of Generative AI:        
 Authors are allowed to use generative AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in writing or research. However, authors must take full responsibility for all content in their paper, including any content generated by AI tools that might be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct. We encourage authors to explain any notable ways in which these tools were used in their research methodology. LLMs are not eligible for authorship.        
 Ethical Conduct for Peer Review:        
 Authors are expected to follow standard ethical conduct for peer review. In particular:        
 Plagiarism in any form is forbidden. 
  Advertising work (e.g., in a talk, on social media) as being under submission to ICML during the review period is forbidden. 
  Any form of | collusion, either direct or indirect (e.g., where authors cooperate with reviewers, ACs, or SACs to obtain favorable or unfavorable reviews) is forbidden. 
  If you believe someone may be engaging in unethical conduct, please notify ICML by filling out the       Ethics Violation Reporting form         .        
 All suspected unethical behaviors will be investigated by ICML’s oversight committee and individuals found violating the rules may face sanctions and/or have their submissions rejected. We will also collect names of individuals that are found to have violated ethics standards; if individuals representing conferences, journals, or other organizations request this list for decision making purposes, we may make this information available to them. See ICML’s Code of Conduct for additional details.        
 Impact Statements:        
 Authors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement should be in a separate section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements, before References), and does       not       count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such as:        
 “This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.”        
 The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we encourage authors to think about whether there is content which       does       warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the paper is later flagged for ethics review.        
 In particular, Reviewers and ACs may flag submissions for ethics review. Flagged submissions will be sent to an ethics review committee for comments. Ethics reviewers do not have the authority to reject papers, but in extreme cases papers may be rejected by the program chairs on ethical grounds, regardless of scientific quality or contribution.         
 Lay summaries:        
 New this year        : Authors of        accepted papers        will be required to submit a short “lay summary” of their work (also called "plain language summary") in OpenReview when submitting their camera-ready paper. As machine learning is becoming a more prevalent topic of interest in society, it is important to participate in science communication with the public. Lay summaries are increasingly common for scientific research in other public-facing fields such as medicine and healthcare. See        this paper          for guidelines. Additional details and examples will be provided prior to the camera-ready deadline.

 The 32nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols   (ICNP 2024)  
  Charleroi, Belgium, October 28-31, 2024 Follow @IEEE_ICNP     
   
 ICNP, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. ICNP 2024 will be organized by UCLouvain and the University of Mons in Charleroi, Belgium on October 28-31, 2024.  
 Scope  
 The conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to the field of network protocol  research. Both experimental studies as well as formal investigations are equally welcome. Topics traditionally of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 All aspects of network protocol research including design, specification, verification implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis. 
  Protocols for data center networks, software-defined networks, information-centric networking (ICN), AI/ML clusters, Internet of Things, cellular networks, sensor networks, satellite networks, vehicular networks, and wireless networks. 
  Domain-specific solutions, including protocols for network security, routing, user privacy, or network management. 
  Network protocols meet AI/ML, e.g., application of AI/ML to improve network protocols and operations; networking and protocols for improving the performance of AI/ML systems. 
  Contributions to network architecture, e.g., algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures. 
  Contributions to other areas of data communications to the extent that they articulate a strong connection to network protocols, for example by discussing potential implications on the design, implementation or performance of certain types of network protocols. 
  Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might fit the scope of the conference are welcome to contact the Program Committee Co-Chairs.

 Camera ready version: | September 16, 2024 
  
 Paper Formatting  
 Paper submissions should adhere to the IEEE Conference formatting requirements using the templates available here  , and should not exceed 10 pages excluding  references. It is the authors' responsibility to produce readable submissions that comply with the formatting constraints. Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed. The authors would have developed software or collected data for the paper are encouraged to release their artefacts and describe them in the submitted paper. To preserve anonymity, the artefacts will only be publicly released upon paper acceptance.  
 Submission and Anonymity Policy  
 Papers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome:  
 Remove all authors' identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources. 
  Use anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments. 
  When referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author. 
  Besides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee Co-Chairs. All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 Submission and Plagiarism Policy  
 Papers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy  and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Best Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication  
 One of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.  
 Presentation and Registration Requirements  
 ICNP 2024 will be held physically in-person in Charleroi, Belgium. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore.

 Welcome to  ACM ICMR 2024  
 Effectively and efficiently retrieving information based on user needs is one of the most exciting areas in multimedia research. The Annual ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR) offers a great opportunity for exchanging leading-edge multimedia retrieval ideas among researchers, practitioners and other potential users of multimedia retrieval systems. ACM ICMR 2024 will take place in Phuket, Thailand from the 10-14th June 2024. The conference venue is the Dusit Thani Laguna Phuket, in Phuket Island. ACM ICMR was created in 2011 from the merger of the ACM CIVR (International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval) and ACM MIR (International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval). ACM ICMR serves to illuminate the state of the art in multimedia (e.g., text, image, video, audio, sensor data, 3D) retrieval. ICMR 2020 in Dublin follows the successful previous editions of ICMR in Trento, Italy 2011; Hong Kong, China 2012; Dallas, USA 2013; Glasgow, UK 2014; Shanghai, China 2015; New York, USA 2016; Bucharest, Romania 2017; Yokohama, Japan 2018; Ottawa, Canada 2019; Dublin, Ireland 2020; Taipei, Taiwan 2021; Newark, NJ, USA 2022 and Thessaloniki, Greece 2023. ACM ICMR 2024 is calling for submissions presenting significant and innovative research in multimedia retrieval and related fields. Papers should extend the state of the art by addressing new problems or proposing insightful solutions. The scope of the conference includes core topics in multimedia retrieval and recommendation, as well as the broader set of topics that must be addressed to ensure that multimedia retrieval technologies are of practical use in real-world use cases. Special emphasis is placed on topics related to large-scale indexing, mixed reality user interaction, exploiting diverse and multimodal data, and domain-specific challenges.

  ICMR 2024 - Call for Papers  
 This page gives the instructions for submitting reproducibility companion papers for the ACM ICMR 2024. Such a submission has essentially two parts:  
 Companion Paper  : The companion paper is 2–3.5 pages in length (with an optional page for references). It contains a high-level description of the experiments carried out in the original paper and that are implemented in the archive. 
  Archive  : Contains the artifacts (e.g., code, scripts, data sets, protocols), which are finalized and packaged, ready to download and reproduce the results in the paper. It contains detailed readme file(s), examples, and all information needed to successfully carry out the experiments. 
  These instructions are split into sections that detail:

 Please select Reproducibility Track  for submission.  
  Submission Guidelines  
 Authors that have a regular long/short or a Special Session (only appliable for ICMR 2022) paper published at ACM ICMR 2022/2023 are invited to submit a short reproducibility companion paper to the ICMR Reproducibility track at ACM ICMR 2024. That companion paper typically focuses on the technical details of what you published at ACM ICMR 2022/2023.  
 The companion paper should be submitted as a short paper that is 2–3.5 pages long, excluding references. It must follow the standard ACM style format, double column. It has to involve a majority of the authors of the original paper and provide in the clear their names and affiliations. The original ACM ICMR 2022/2023 contribution associated with this companion paper must be clearly referenced.  
 The reproducibility companion paper and the associated artifacts will undergo a reproducibility review, which will result in an accept or a reject decision. Rejected papers are not disclosed.  
 If accepted, a Results Reproduced  ACM badge is added to the original paper and to the companion paper, which are both stored in the ACM Digital Library, together with the artifacts. A badged companion paper will appear in the ACM ICMR 2024 proceedings and will be presented as a poster in the ACM ICMR 2024 Reproducibility poster session. The reviewers of the badged companion paper add a section documenting their efforts and become co-authors of the paper. The final version may be up to 4 pages (with an optional page for references).  
 If, during the evaluation, a serious flaw invalidating the scientific results published in the original contribution is discovered, then the companion paper is rejected, and the authors are encouraged to publish an errata.  
 Note: If your original paper turns out to be especially challenging to reproduce, the committee may also recommend that the companion paper be published in the next year of ACM ICMR, instead of ACM ICMR 2024. If replication cannot be completed in time for the next year of ACM ICMR too, then the paper cannot be accepted.  
  Paper Badge  
 We are committed to setting the standard high for reproducibility at ACM ICMR, and the Reproducibility Committee asks authors to target a top-quality badge for the companion papers they submit. The target is the Results Reproduced badge:  
   
 ACM gives the following definition of this Results Reproduced  badge:  
 The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
  Contents of the Companion Paper  
 The companion paper must provide means for the committee to download the artifacts that will enable replicating the findings that are in the original paper contribution. The author-created artifacts that are relevant to this paper must have been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository (e.g. GitHub).  
 The companion paper must describe the procedure allowing reviewers to easily find their way in the artifacts. That procedure might for example explain the reasons for having organized the artifacts in hierarchies of folders. It might specify what items inside the artifacts must be read, and in which order, what are the main elements to fully review. It might clearly establish relationships between items in the artifacts and the corresponding elements that can be found in the original scientific contribution. It might explain and justify why this or that part of the original paper is not reproducible. The paper should indicate the expected duration of running the whole experimental pipeline.  
 Ideally, the companion paper should include text/schemas/illustrations that describe what the artifacts contain and how they should be deployed and then used. The companion paper should also contain notes about parameters that can be set or adjusted and about how to recreate the plots. It has to have examples, with comments. You can of course create documents in the archive that provide additional text/schemas/illustrations. In this case, the companion paper should clearly indicate where that can be found in the artifacts.  
  Contents of the Archive of Artifacts  
 Replicability is grounded in code, scripts, and datasets that you provide and that form so called “artifacts”. More formally, ACM defines artifacts as follows:  
 By “artifact” we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
 Artifacts contain digital objects that supplement the companion paper. Artifacts are typically a series of files, possibly organized according to a clear and easy-to-grasp hierarchy. Artifacts include for example:  
 The configuration files and scripts to set up and deploy the environment needed for the reviewers to subsequently run your code, 
  The source code if you expose your system as a white box, 
  Input Data: Either the process to generate the input data should be made available, or when the data is not generated, the actual data itself or a link to the data should be provided, 
  The set of experiments (system configuration and initialization, scripts, workload, measurement protocol, …) used to run the experiments that produce the raw experimental data, 
  The scripts needed to transform the raw experimental data into the graphs, tables, plots, …, that can be found in the original submission already published in the proceedings of ACM ICMR. All this material should be extensively described, documented, commented, and easy to understand, for example in specific files coming together with what they describe. 
  Note  : We strongly recommend exposing your system as a white box so that anyone can reproduce and reuse your results. If the system is only made accessible as a black box, however, reviewers may still require confidential access to source code, such that they can properly assess the validity of the reproducibility results.  
 About Experiments  
 The central results and claims of the corresponding published paper should be supported by the submitted experiments, meaning we can recreate result data and graphs that demonstrate similar behavior to that shown in that paper. Typically when the results are about response times, we do not expect to get identical results. Instead, we expect to see that the overall behavior matches the conclusions from the paper, e.g., that a given algorithm is significantly faster than another one, or that a given parameter affects negatively or positively the behavior of a system.  
 Given a system, the authors should provide the complete set of experiments to reproduce the results that are in the original paper. Typically, each experiment will consist of the following parts.  
 A setup phase where parameters are configured and data is loaded, 
  A running phase where a workload is applied and measurements are taken, 
  A clean-up phase where the system is prepared to avoid interference with the next round of experiments. 
  The authors should document (i) how to perform the setup, running and clean-up phases, and (ii) how to check that these phases are complete as they should. The authors should document the expected effect of the setup phase (e.g., a cold file cache is enforced) and the different steps of the running phase, e.g., by documenting the combination of command line options used to run a given experiment script.  
 Each experiment should be automatic, e.g., via a script that takes a range of values for each experiment parameter as arguments, rather than manual, e.g., via a script that must be edited so that a constant takes the value of a given experiment parameter.  
 We do not expect the authors to perform any additional experiments on top of the ones in their original paper. Any additional experiments submitted will be considered and tested but they are not required.  
 About Graphs and Plots  
 For each graph/plot in the original paper, the authors should describe how the graph/plot is obtained from the experimental measurements. The submission should contain the scripts (or spreadsheets) that are used to generate the graphs/plots. We strongly encourage authors to provide scripts for all their graphs using a tool such as Gnuplot or Matplotlib. Here are two useful tutorials for Gnuplot: a brief manual and tutorial  , and a tutorial with details about creating eps figures and embed them using LaTeX  and another two for Matplotlib: examples from SciPy  , and a step-by-step tutorial discussing many features  .  
 Similar procedures must be provided by the authors in order to create the tables that are in the original paper.  
 Ideal archive of artifacts  
 Authors are encouraged to strive for this ideal submission for truly replicable work…  
 At a minimum, the authors should provide a complete set of scripts to install the system, produce the data, run experiments and produce the resulting graphs along with detailed readme file(s) that describe the process step by step so it can be easily redone by a reviewer.  
 The ideal submission consists of an extremely careful and detailed description of the experiments, their parameters, and of a master script that:  
 installs all systems needed, 
  generates or fetches all needed input data, 
  reruns all experiments and generates all results, 
  generates all graphs, plots, and tables, and finally, 
  recompiles the sources of the paper 
  … to produce a brand new PDF for the paper with all the reproduced experiments. It’ll allow comparing the obtained material with the one in the original contribution that was accepted at ACM MM.  
   
 Packaging Guidelines  
 These packaging guidelines are meant to cover general cases. Please keep in mind that every individual case is slightly different.  
 Environment  
 Authors should explicitly specify the operating system and tools that should be installed as the environment. Such specification should include dependencies with specific hardware features (e.g., 25 GB of RAM are needed) or dependencies within the environment (e.g., the compiler that should be used must be run with a specific version of the operating system).  
 Note: The submitted artifacts should not require specific hardware and software that are hard to get access to. The committee will try to do the best to find reviewers who can setup the required environments; however, if no reviewer can be found, the companion paper cannot be accepted.  
 System  
 System setup is one of the most challenging aspects when replicating experiments. System setup will be easier to conduct if it is automatic rather than manual. Authors should test that the system they distribute can actually be installed in a new environment. The documentation should detail every step in the system setup:  
 How to obtain the system? 
  How to configure the environment if need be (e.g., environment variables, paths)? 
  How to compile the system? (existing compilation options should be mentioned) 
  How to use the system? (What are the configuration options and parameters to the system?) 
  How to make sure that the system is installed correctly? 
  The above tasks should be achieved by executing a set of scripts provided by the authors that will download needed components (systems, libraries), initialize the environment, check that software and hardware is compatible, and deploy the system.  
 Tools  
 The committee suggests that authors use ReproZip in order to streamline this process. ReproZip can be used to capture the environment, the input files, the expected output files, and the required libraries. A detailed how-to guide (installing, packing experiments, unpacking experiments) can be found there. ReproZip will help both the authors and the evaluators to seamlessly rerun experiments.  
 If using ReproZip to capture the experiments proves to be difficult for a particular paper, the committee will work with the authors to find the proper solution based on the specifics of the paper and the environment needed.

  Paper Badge  
 We are committed to setting the standard high for reproducibility at ACM ICMR, and the Reproducibility Committee asks authors to target a top-quality badge for the companion papers they submit. The target is the Results Reproduced badge:  
   
 ACM gives the following definition of this Results Reproduced  badge:  
 The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
  Contents of the Companion Paper  
 The companion paper must provide means for the committee to download the artifacts that will enable replicating the findings that are in the original paper contribution. The author-created artifacts that are relevant to this paper must have been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository (e.g. GitHub).  
 The companion paper must describe the procedure allowing reviewers to easily find their way in the artifacts. That procedure might for example explain the reasons for having organized the artifacts in hierarchies of folders. It might specify what items inside the artifacts must be read, and in which order, what are the main elements to fully review. It might clearly establish relationships between items in the artifacts and the corresponding elements that can be found in the original scientific contribution. It might explain and justify why this or that part of the original paper is not reproducible. The paper should indicate the expected duration of running the whole experimental pipeline.  
 Ideally, the companion paper should include text/schemas/illustrations that describe what the artifacts contain and how they should be deployed and then used. The companion paper should also contain notes about parameters that can be set or adjusted and about how to recreate the plots. It has to have examples, with comments. You can of course create documents in the archive that provide additional text/schemas/illustrations. In this case, the companion paper should clearly indicate where that can be found in the artifacts.  
  Contents of the Archive of Artifacts  
 Replicability is grounded in code, scripts, and datasets that you provide and that form so called “artifacts”. More formally, ACM defines artifacts as follows:  
 By “artifact” we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
 Artifacts contain digital objects that supplement the companion paper. Artifacts are typically a series of files, possibly organized according to a clear and easy-to-grasp hierarchy. Artifacts include for example:  
 The configuration files and scripts to set up and deploy the environment needed for the reviewers to subsequently run your code, 
  The source code if you expose your system as a white box, 
  Input Data: Either the process to generate the input data should be made available, or when the data is not generated, the actual data itself or a link to the data should be provided, 
  The set of experiments (system configuration and initialization, scripts, workload, measurement protocol, …) used to run the experiments that produce the raw experimental data, 
  The scripts needed to transform the raw experimental data into the graphs, tables, plots, …, that can be found in the original submission already published in the proceedings of ACM ICMR. All this material should be extensively described, documented, commented, and easy to understand, for example in specific files coming together with what they describe. 
  Note  : We strongly recommend exposing your system as a white box so that anyone can reproduce and reuse your results. If the system is only made accessible as a black box, however, reviewers may still require confidential access to source code, such that they can properly assess the validity of the reproducibility results.  
 About Experiments  
 The central results and claims of the corresponding published paper should be supported by the submitted experiments, meaning we can recreate result data and graphs that demonstrate similar behavior to that shown in that paper. Typically when the results are about response times, we do not expect to get identical results. Instead, we expect to see that the overall behavior matches the conclusions from the paper, e.g., that a given algorithm is significantly faster than another one, or that a given parameter affects negatively or positively the behavior of a system.  
 Given a system, the authors should provide the complete set of experiments to reproduce the results that are in the original paper. Typically, each experiment will consist of the following parts.  
 A setup phase where parameters are configured and data is loaded, 
  A running phase where a workload is applied and measurements are taken, 
  A clean-up phase where the system is prepared to avoid interference with the next round of experiments. 
  The authors should document (i) how to perform the setup, running and clean-up phases, and (ii) how to check that these phases are complete as they should. The authors should document the expected effect of the setup phase (e.g., a cold file cache is enforced) and the different steps of the running phase, e.g., by documenting the combination of command line options used to run a given experiment script.  
 Each experiment should be automatic, e.g., via a script that takes a range of values for each experiment parameter as arguments, rather than manual, e.g., via a script that must be edited so that a constant takes the value of a given experiment parameter.  
 We do not expect the authors to perform any additional experiments on top of the ones in their original paper. Any additional experiments submitted will be considered and tested but they are not required.  
 About Graphs and Plots  
 For each graph/plot in the original paper, the authors should describe how the graph/plot is obtained from the experimental measurements. The submission should contain the scripts (or spreadsheets) that are used to generate the graphs/plots. We strongly encourage authors to provide scripts for all their graphs using a tool such as Gnuplot or Matplotlib. Here are two useful tutorials for Gnuplot: a brief manual and tutorial  , and a tutorial with details about creating eps figures and embed them using LaTeX  and another two for Matplotlib: examples from SciPy  , and a step-by-step tutorial discussing many features  .  
 Similar procedures must be provided by the authors in order to create the tables that are in the original paper.  
 Ideal archive of artifacts  
 Authors are encouraged to strive for this ideal submission for truly replicable work…  
 At a minimum, the authors should provide a complete set of scripts to install the system, produce the data, run experiments and produce the resulting graphs along with detailed readme file(s) that describe the process step by step so it can be easily redone by a reviewer.

  … to produce a brand new PDF for the paper with all the reproduced experiments. It’ll allow comparing the obtained material with the one in the original contribution that was accepted at ACM MM.  
   
 Packaging Guidelines  
 These packaging guidelines are meant to cover general cases. Please keep in mind that every individual case is slightly different.  
 Environment  
 Authors should explicitly specify the operating system and tools that should be installed as the environment. Such specification should include dependencies with specific hardware features (e.g., 25 GB of RAM are needed) or dependencies within the environment (e.g., the compiler that should be used must be run with a specific version of the operating system).  
 Note: The submitted artifacts should not require specific hardware and software that are hard to get access to. The committee will try to do the best to find reviewers who can setup the required environments; however, if no reviewer can be found, the companion paper cannot be accepted.  
 System  
 System setup is one of the most challenging aspects when replicating experiments. System setup will be easier to conduct if it is automatic rather than manual. Authors should test that the system they distribute can actually be installed in a new environment. The documentation should detail every step in the system setup:  
 How to obtain the system? 
  How to configure the environment if need be (e.g., environment variables, paths)? 
  How to compile the system? (existing compilation options should be mentioned) 
  How to use the system? (What are the configuration options and parameters to the system?) 
  How to make sure that the system is installed correctly? 
  The above tasks should be achieved by executing a set of scripts provided by the authors that will download needed components (systems, libraries), initialize the environment, check that software and hardware is compatible, and deploy the system.  
 Tools  
 The committee suggests that authors use ReproZip in order to streamline this process. ReproZip can be used to capture the environment, the input files, the expected output files, and the required libraries. A detailed how-to guide (installing, packing experiments, unpacking experiments) can be found there. ReproZip will help both the authors and the evaluators to seamlessly rerun experiments.  
 If using ReproZip to capture the experiments proves to be difficult for a particular paper, the committee will work with the authors to find the proper solution based on the specifics of the paper and the environment needed.

 Note: If your original paper turns out to be especially challenging to reproduce, the committee may also recommend that the companion paper be published in the next year of ACM ICMR, instead of ACM ICMR 2024. If replication cannot be completed in time for the next year of ACM ICMR too, then the paper cannot be accepted.  
  Paper Badge  
 We are committed to setting the standard high for reproducibility at ACM ICMR, and the Reproducibility Committee asks authors to target a top-quality badge for the companion papers they submit. The target is the Results Reproduced badge:  
   
 ACM gives the following definition of this Results Reproduced  badge:  
 The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
  Contents of the Companion Paper  
 The companion paper must provide means for the committee to download the artifacts that will enable replicating the findings that are in the original paper contribution. The author-created artifacts that are relevant to this paper must have been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository (e.g. GitHub).  
 The companion paper must describe the procedure allowing reviewers to easily find their way in the artifacts. That procedure might for example explain the reasons for having organized the artifacts in hierarchies of folders. It might specify what items inside the artifacts must be read, and in which order, what are the main elements to fully review. It might clearly establish relationships between items in the artifacts and the corresponding elements that can be found in the original scientific contribution. It might explain and justify why this or that part of the original paper is not reproducible. The paper should indicate the expected duration of running the whole experimental pipeline.  
 Ideally, the companion paper should include text/schemas/illustrations that describe what the artifacts contain and how they should be deployed and then used. The companion paper should also contain notes about parameters that can be set or adjusted and about how to recreate the plots. It has to have examples, with comments. You can of course create documents in the archive that provide additional text/schemas/illustrations. In this case, the companion paper should clearly indicate where that can be found in the artifacts.  
  Contents of the Archive of Artifacts  
 Replicability is grounded in code, scripts, and datasets that you provide and that form so called “artifacts”. More formally, ACM defines artifacts as follows:  
 By “artifact” we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
 Artifacts contain digital objects that supplement the companion paper. Artifacts are typically a series of files, possibly organized according to a clear and easy-to-grasp hierarchy. Artifacts include for example:  
 The configuration files and scripts to set up and deploy the environment needed for the reviewers to subsequently run your code, 
  The source code if you expose your system as a white box, 
  Input Data: Either the process to generate the input data should be made available, or when the data is not generated, the actual data itself or a link to the data should be provided, 
  The set of experiments (system configuration and initialization, scripts, workload, measurement protocol, …) used to run the experiments that produce the raw experimental data, 
  The scripts needed to transform the raw experimental data into the graphs, tables, plots, …, that can be found in the original submission already published in the proceedings of ACM ICMR. All this material should be extensively described, documented, commented, and easy to understand, for example in specific files coming together with what they describe. 
  Note  : We strongly recommend exposing your system as a white box so that anyone can reproduce and reuse your results. If the system is only made accessible as a black box, however, reviewers may still require confidential access to source code, such that they can properly assess the validity of the reproducibility results.  
 About Experiments  
 The central results and claims of the corresponding published paper should be supported by the submitted experiments, meaning we can recreate result data and graphs that demonstrate similar behavior to that shown in that paper. Typically when the results are about response times, we do not expect to get identical results. Instead, we expect to see that the overall behavior matches the conclusions from the paper, e.g., that a given algorithm is significantly faster than another one, or that a given parameter affects negatively or positively the behavior of a system.  
 Given a system, the authors should provide the complete set of experiments to reproduce the results that are in the original paper. Typically, each experiment will consist of the following parts.  
 A setup phase where parameters are configured and data is loaded, 
  A running phase where a workload is applied and measurements are taken, 
  A clean-up phase where the system is prepared to avoid interference with the next round of experiments. 
  The authors should document (i) how to perform the setup, running and clean-up phases, and (ii) how to check that these phases are complete as they should. The authors should document the expected effect of the setup phase (e.g., a cold file cache is enforced) and the different steps of the running phase, e.g., by documenting the combination of command line options used to run a given experiment script.  
 Each experiment should be automatic, e.g., via a script that takes a range of values for each experiment parameter as arguments, rather than manual, e.g., via a script that must be edited so that a constant takes the value of a given experiment parameter.  
 We do not expect the authors to perform any additional experiments on top of the ones in their original paper. Any additional experiments submitted will be considered and tested but they are not required.  
 About Graphs and Plots  
 For each graph/plot in the original paper, the authors should describe how the graph/plot is obtained from the experimental measurements. The submission should contain the scripts (or spreadsheets) that are used to generate the graphs/plots. We strongly encourage authors to provide scripts for all their graphs using a tool such as Gnuplot or Matplotlib. Here are two useful tutorials for Gnuplot: a brief manual and tutorial  , and a tutorial with details about creating eps figures and embed them using LaTeX  and another two for Matplotlib: examples from SciPy  , and a step-by-step tutorial discussing many features  .  
 Similar procedures must be provided by the authors in order to create the tables that are in the original paper.  
 Ideal archive of artifacts  
 Authors are encouraged to strive for this ideal submission for truly replicable work…  
 At a minimum, the authors should provide a complete set of scripts to install the system, produce the data, run experiments and produce the resulting graphs along with detailed readme file(s) that describe the process step by step so it can be easily redone by a reviewer.  
 The ideal submission consists of an extremely careful and detailed description of the experiments, their parameters, and of a master script that:  
 installs all systems needed, 
  generates or fetches all needed input data, 
  reruns all experiments and generates all results, 
  generates all graphs, plots, and tables, and finally, 
  recompiles the sources of the paper 
  … to produce a brand new PDF for the paper with all the reproduced experiments. It’ll allow comparing the obtained material with the one in the original contribution that was accepted at ACM MM.  
   
 Packaging Guidelines  
 These packaging guidelines are meant to cover general cases. Please keep in mind that every individual case is slightly different.  
 Environment  
 Authors should explicitly specify the operating system and tools that should be installed as the environment. Such specification should include dependencies with specific hardware features (e.g., 25 GB of RAM are needed) or dependencies within the environment (e.g., the compiler that should be used must be run with a specific version of the operating system).  
 Note: The submitted artifacts should not require specific hardware and software that are hard to get access to. The committee will try to do the best to find reviewers who can setup the required environments; however, if no reviewer can be found, the companion paper cannot be accepted.  
 System  
 System setup is one of the most challenging aspects when replicating experiments. System setup will be easier to conduct if it is automatic rather than manual. Authors should test that the system they distribute can actually be installed in a new environment. The documentation should detail every step in the system setup:  
 How to obtain the system? 
  How to configure the environment if need be (e.g., environment variables, paths)? 
  How to compile the system? (existing compilation options should be mentioned) 
  How to use the system? (What are the configuration options and parameters to the system?) 
  How to make sure that the system is installed correctly? 
  The above tasks should be achieved by executing a set of scripts provided by the authors that will download needed components (systems, libraries), initialize the environment, check that software and hardware is compatible, and deploy the system.  
 Tools  
 The committee suggests that authors use ReproZip in order to streamline this process. ReproZip can be used to capture the environment, the input files, the expected output files, and the required libraries. A detailed how-to guide (installing, packing experiments, unpacking experiments) can be found there. ReproZip will help both the authors and the evaluators to seamlessly rerun experiments.  
 If using ReproZip to capture the experiments proves to be difficult for a particular paper, the committee will work with the authors to find the proper solution based on the specifics of the paper and the environment needed.

  ICMR 2024 - Call for Papers  
 This page gives the instructions for submitting reproducibility companion papers for the ACM ICMR 2024. Such a submission has essentially two parts:  
 Companion Paper  : The companion paper is 2–3.5 pages in length (with an optional page for references). It contains a high-level description of the experiments carried out in the original paper and that are implemented in the archive. 
  Archive  : Contains the artifacts (e.g., code, scripts, data sets, protocols), which are finalized and packaged, ready to download and reproduce the results in the paper. It contains detailed readme file(s), examples, and all information needed to successfully carry out the experiments. 
  These instructions are split into sections that detail:

 Please select Reproducibility Track  for submission.  
  Submission Guidelines  
 Authors that have a regular long/short or a Special Session (only appliable for ICMR 2022) paper published at ACM ICMR 2022/2023 are invited to submit a short reproducibility companion paper to the ICMR Reproducibility track at ACM ICMR 2024. That companion paper typically focuses on the technical details of what you published at ACM ICMR 2022/2023.  
 The companion paper should be submitted as a short paper that is 2–3.5 pages long, excluding references. It must follow the standard ACM style format, double column. It has to involve a majority of the authors of the original paper and provide in the clear their names and affiliations. The original ACM ICMR 2022/2023 contribution associated with this companion paper must be clearly referenced.  
 The reproducibility companion paper and the associated artifacts will undergo a reproducibility review, which will result in an accept or a reject decision. Rejected papers are not disclosed.  
 If accepted, a Results Reproduced  ACM badge is added to the original paper and to the companion paper, which are both stored in the ACM Digital Library, together with the artifacts. A badged companion paper will appear in the ACM ICMR 2024 proceedings and will be presented as a poster in the ACM ICMR 2024 Reproducibility poster session. The reviewers of the badged companion paper add a section documenting their efforts and become co-authors of the paper. The final version may be up to 4 pages (with an optional page for references).  
 If, during the evaluation, a serious flaw invalidating the scientific results published in the original contribution is discovered, then the companion paper is rejected, and the authors are encouraged to publish an errata.  
 Note: If your original paper turns out to be especially challenging to reproduce, the committee may also recommend that the companion paper be published in the next year of ACM ICMR, instead of ACM ICMR 2024. If replication cannot be completed in time for the next year of ACM ICMR too, then the paper cannot be accepted.  
  Paper Badge  
 We are committed to setting the standard high for reproducibility at ACM ICMR, and the Reproducibility Committee asks authors to target a top-quality badge for the companion papers they submit. The target is the Results Reproduced badge:  
   
 ACM gives the following definition of this Results Reproduced  badge:  
 The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.

  Contents of the Companion Paper  
 The companion paper must provide means for the committee to download the artifacts that will enable replicating the findings that are in the original paper contribution. The author-created artifacts that are relevant to this paper must have been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository (e.g. GitHub).  
 The companion paper must describe the procedure allowing reviewers to easily find their way in the artifacts. That procedure might for example explain the reasons for having organized the artifacts in hierarchies of folders. It might specify what items inside the artifacts must be read, and in which order, what are the main elements to fully review. It might clearly establish relationships between items in the artifacts and the corresponding elements that can be found in the original scientific contribution. It might explain and justify why this or that part of the original paper is not reproducible. The paper should indicate the expected duration of running the whole experimental pipeline.  
 Ideally, the companion paper should include text/schemas/illustrations that describe what the artifacts contain and how they should be deployed and then used. The companion paper should also contain notes about parameters that can be set or adjusted and about how to recreate the plots. It has to have examples, with comments. You can of course create documents in the archive that provide additional text/schemas/illustrations. In this case, the companion paper should clearly indicate where that can be found in the artifacts.  
  Contents of the Archive of Artifacts  
 Replicability is grounded in code, scripts, and datasets that you provide and that form so called “artifacts”. More formally, ACM defines artifacts as follows:  
 By “artifact” we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  
  » ACM DL. Read it here  .  
  
 Artifacts contain digital objects that supplement the companion paper. Artifacts are typically a series of files, possibly organized according to a clear and easy-to-grasp hierarchy. Artifacts include for example:  
 The configuration files and scripts to set up and deploy the environment needed for the reviewers to subsequently run your code, 
  The source code if you expose your system as a white box, 
  Input Data: Either the process to generate the input data should be made available, or when the data is not generated, the actual data itself or a link to the data should be provided, 
  The set of experiments (system configuration and initialization, scripts, workload, measurement protocol, …) used to run the experiments that produce the raw experimental data, 
  The scripts needed to transform the raw experimental data into the graphs, tables, plots, …, that can be found in the original submission already published in the proceedings of ACM ICMR. All this material should be extensively described, documented, commented, and easy to understand, for example in specific files coming together with what they describe. 
  Note  : We strongly recommend exposing your system as a white box so that anyone can reproduce and reuse your results. If the system is only made accessible as a black box, however, reviewers may still require confidential access to source code, such that they can properly assess the validity of the reproducibility results.  
 About Experiments  
 The central results and claims of the corresponding published paper should be supported by the submitted experiments, meaning we can recreate result data and graphs that demonstrate similar behavior to that shown in that paper. Typically when the results are about response times, we do not expect to get identical results. Instead, we expect to see that the overall behavior matches the conclusions from the paper, e.g., that a given algorithm is significantly faster than another one, or that a given parameter affects negatively or positively the behavior of a system.  
 Given a system, the authors should provide the complete set of experiments to reproduce the results that are in the original paper. Typically, each experiment will consist of the following parts.  
 A setup phase where parameters are configured and data is loaded, 
  A running phase where a workload is applied and measurements are taken, 
  A clean-up phase where the system is prepared to avoid interference with the next round of experiments. 
  The authors should document (i) how to perform the setup, running and clean-up phases, and (ii) how to check that these phases are complete as they should. The authors should document the expected effect of the setup phase (e.g., a cold file cache is enforced) and the different steps of the running phase, e.g., by documenting the combination of command line options used to run a given experiment script.  
 Each experiment should be automatic, e.g., via a script that takes a range of values for each experiment parameter as arguments, rather than manual, e.g., via a script that must be edited so that a constant takes the value of a given experiment parameter.  
 We do not expect the authors to perform any additional experiments on top of the ones in their original paper. Any additional experiments submitted will be considered and tested but they are not required.  
 About Graphs and Plots  
 For each graph/plot in the original paper, the authors should describe how the graph/plot is obtained from the experimental measurements. The submission should contain the scripts (or spreadsheets) that are used to generate the graphs/plots. We strongly encourage authors to provide scripts for all their graphs using a tool such as Gnuplot or Matplotlib. Here are two useful tutorials for Gnuplot: a brief manual and tutorial  , and a tutorial with details about creating eps figures and embed them using LaTeX  and another two for Matplotlib: examples from SciPy  , and a step-by-step tutorial discussing many features  .  
 Similar procedures must be provided by the authors in order to create the tables that are in the original paper.  
 Ideal archive of artifacts  
 Authors are encouraged to strive for this ideal submission for truly replicable work…  
 At a minimum, the authors should provide a complete set of scripts to install the system, produce the data, run experiments and produce the resulting graphs along with detailed readme file(s) that describe the process step by step so it can be easily redone by a reviewer.

  … to produce a brand new PDF for the paper with all the reproduced experiments. It’ll allow comparing the obtained material with the one in the original contribution that was accepted at ACM MM.  
   
 Packaging Guidelines  
 These packaging guidelines are meant to cover general cases. Please keep in mind that every individual case is slightly different.  
 Environment  
 Authors should explicitly specify the operating system and tools that should be installed as the environment. Such specification should include dependencies with specific hardware features (e.g., 25 GB of RAM are needed) or dependencies within the environment (e.g., the compiler that should be used must be run with a specific version of the operating system).  
 Note: The submitted artifacts should not require specific hardware and software that are hard to get access to. The committee will try to do the best to find reviewers who can setup the required environments; however, if no reviewer can be found, the companion paper cannot be accepted.  
 System  
 System setup is one of the most challenging aspects when replicating experiments. System setup will be easier to conduct if it is automatic rather than manual. Authors should test that the system they distribute can actually be installed in a new environment. The documentation should detail every step in the system setup:  
 How to obtain the system? 
  How to configure the environment if need be (e.g., environment variables, paths)? 
  How to compile the system? (existing compilation options should be mentioned) 
  How to use the system? (What are the configuration options and parameters to the system?) 
  How to make sure that the system is installed correctly? 
  The above tasks should be achieved by executing a set of scripts provided by the authors that will download needed components (systems, libraries), initialize the environment, check that software and hardware is compatible, and deploy the system.  
 Tools  
 The committee suggests that authors use ReproZip in order to streamline this process. ReproZip can be used to capture the environment, the input files, the expected output files, and the required libraries. A detailed how-to guide (installing, packing experiments, unpacking experiments) can be found there. ReproZip will help both the authors and the evaluators to seamlessly rerun experiments.  
 If using ReproZip to capture the experiments proves to be difficult for a particular paper, the committee will work with the authors to find the proper solution based on the specifics of the paper and the environment needed.

 Call for Papers  
 The 32nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols   (ICNP 2024)  
  Charleroi, Belgium, October 28-31, 2024 Follow @IEEE_ICNP     
   
 ICNP, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. ICNP 2024 will be organized by UCLouvain and the University of Mons in Charleroi, Belgium on October 28-31, 2024.  
 Scope  
 The conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to the field of network protocol  research. Both experimental studies as well as formal investigations are equally welcome. Topics traditionally of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 All aspects of network protocol research including design, specification, verification implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis. 
  Protocols for data center networks, software-defined networks, information-centric networking (ICN), AI/ML clusters, Internet of Things, cellular networks, sensor networks, satellite networks, vehicular networks, and wireless networks. 
  Domain-specific solutions, including protocols for network security, routing, user privacy, or network management. 
  Network protocols meet AI/ML, e.g., application of AI/ML to improve network protocols and operations; networking and protocols for improving the performance of AI/ML systems. 
  Contributions to network architecture, e.g., algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures. 
  Contributions to other areas of data communications to the extent that they articulate a strong connection to network protocols, for example by discussing potential implications on the design, implementation or performance of certain types of network protocols. 
  Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might fit the scope of the conference are welcome to contact the Program Committee Co-Chairs.

 Paper Formatting  
 Paper submissions should adhere to the IEEE Conference formatting requirements using the templates available here  , and should not exceed 10 pages excluding  references. It is the authors' responsibility to produce readable submissions that comply with the formatting constraints. Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed. The authors would have developed software or collected data for the paper are encouraged to release their artefacts and describe them in the submitted paper. To preserve anonymity, the artefacts will only be publicly released upon paper acceptance.  
 Submission and Anonymity Policy  
 Papers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome:  
 Remove all authors' identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources. 
  Use anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments. 
  When referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author. 
  Besides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee Co-Chairs. All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 Submission and Plagiarism Policy  
 Papers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy  and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Best Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication  
 One of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.  
 Presentation and Registration Requirements  
 ICNP 2024 will be held physically in-person in Charleroi, Belgium. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore.

Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed. The authors would have developed software or collected data for the paper are encouraged to release their artefacts and describe them in the submitted paper. To preserve anonymity, the artefacts will only be publicly released upon paper acceptance.  
 Submission and Anonymity Policy  
 Papers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome:  
 Remove all authors' identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources. 
  Use anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments. 
  When referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author. 
  Besides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee Co-Chairs. All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 Submission and Plagiarism Policy  
 Papers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy  and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Best Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication  
 One of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.  
 Presentation and Registration Requirements  
 ICNP 2024 will be held physically in-person in Charleroi, Belgium. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore.

 ICICI 2025   
 As the world is becoming increasingly digital, technology enables larger data transfers at faster speeds. The recent technological innovations like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Network, Autonomous Learning Systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, etc. have seen as much growth and interest as AI has in the past few years. These technologies transform how enterprises/businesses use data. To deal with massive amounts of data and increasing technology needs, the computing and data science sector continues to grow and adapt to new demands. The 3rd International Conference on Inventive Computing and Informatics, ICICI 2025, provides a global platform for exchanging knowledge and findings in the methodology and applications of intelligent computing and informatics. Researchers/academicians/industrialists are invited to contribute to the conference by submitting novel and unpublished research contributions that illustrate novel research results, new initiatives, surveys, and industry experiences describing major breakthroughs in computing and Informatics.
