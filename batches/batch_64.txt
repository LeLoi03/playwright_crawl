 20th International Conference on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems  
   
 Today we are building an exciting future in which autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, smart cities help solve public problems and achieve a higher quality of life, and service robots support social care workers or perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. However, these software-intensive systems must continuously preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource variability, evolving user needs, attacks and faults. In addition, the complexity of these systems demands them to adapt and manage themselves autonomously.  
 SEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference that applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection. The objective of SEAMS is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to investigate, discuss, examine, and advance the fundamental principles, state of the art, and the solutions addressing critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems.

 Research Area  
 Today, advanced technological products often employ information and communication technology to enhance their functionality and quality. Therefore, nowadays software plays an important role in the control of many technical systems such as electrical and mechanical devices, technical processes in the chemical industry, or a modern automobile. This trend towards software-intensive and embedded systems results in the astonishing observation that the technology company Siemens actually employs more software developers than Microsoft. (Reinhold E. Achatz, Keynote: Optimizing the Software Development in Industry (exemplified for Siemens). Peter Liggesmeyer, Klaus Pohl, Michael Goedicke (Eds.): Software Engineering 2005, 8.-11.3.2005 in Essen. LNI 64 GI 2005. (German).) In addition, we can observe that advanced technological sectors such as the automotive industry have started major efforts to address software quality and software integration issues. (cf. AUTOSAR   )  
 In the future, software-intensive systems are in addition expected to be highly distributed and to exhibit adaptive and anticipatory behavior when operating in highly dynamic environments and interfacing with the physical world. (M. Wirsing (Ed.), Report on the EU/NSF Strategic Workshop on Engineering Software-Intensive Systems, in conjunction with the ICSE05, Edinburgh, UK, 2004.) Therefore, appropriate modeling and analysis techniques to address these software-intensive systems are required (NSF Workshop on Modeling and Simulation For Design of Large Software-Intensive Systems: Toward a New Paradigm Recognizing Networked, Distributed and Diffuse-Control Software, Tucson, Arizona, USA, 2003.) that support a mix of models from a multitude of disciplines such as software engineering, control engineering, and business process engineering.  
 Current Research  
 Suitable visual modeling techniques for the software architecture of distributed systems, the modeling of service- and component-based systems, and an approach for the consistent integration of different architectural views by means of synthesis have been developed which enable to systematically study architectural decisions and detect problems early on.  
 Software-intensive systems are often not only distributed, but also contain embedded systems, which must exhibit hard real-time behavior. To also address these requirements, an approach to model such software-intensive systems and their architectures a multi-agent system with autonomous, self-adaptive agents using UML components and patterns with real-time behavior has been developed. In addition, we made first steps towards the synthesis of the real-time behavior from scenariosto ease the transition from requirements to design.  
 To be able to integrate the models from the other disciplines usually involved in the development of software-intensive systems, such as control engineering and business process engineering, into our software engineering model, we studied the integration of workflow and UML models and the integration of control-oriented quasi-continuous models into hierarchical UML components and Statecharts. The concepts can be further employed to also describe self-adaptive behavior in form of hierarchical reconfiguration and support the decoupling of soft and non real-time tasks at the architectural level.  
 As software-intensive systems are often safety-critical systems, suitable means to identify and analyze relevant hazards are mandatory. A compositional hazard analysis which exploits the component structure of the system and an approach for the automatic compositional verification of embedded real-time systems using components and patterns and the modular verification of the hierarchical hybrid systems with modular reconfiguration capabilities have thus been developed. The verification approach is supplemented by a technique to verify structural safety properties for infinite state systems with structural adaptation behavior at run-time.  
 We further developed concepts for the code-generation of hard real-time systems, which ensure, that the high level properties of the models, which have been analyzed and verified, can also be guaranteed for the generated code.  
 The results obtained for the modeling, analysis, synthesis, and code generation are supported by the Fujaba Real-Time Tool Suite. This real-time version of the UML CASE tool Fujaba Tool Suite provides seamless tool support for the model-driven development of self-optimizing mechatronic systems.  
 In the context of the model-driven development of software, some general concepts for the integration of different modeling artifacts at the meta-model level and model synchronization have been developed.  
 More information can be found on the websites of the particular research projects   .

  About Italy   
 Italy is located in southern Europe on the Apennine Peninsula. Its distinct shape, resembling a kicking boot, makes it easy to recognize it on maps or even from space.   
  The Adriatic Sea borders the peninsula in the east, the Sea of Sicily in the south, the Ionian Sea in the southeast, the Ligurian Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west, all those seas are parts of the Mediterranean Sea.   
  Italy has international borders with Austria, France, the Holy See (Vatican City), San Marino, Slovenia, and Switzerland. It also shares maritime borders with Albania, Algeria, Croatia, Greece, Libya, Malta, Montenegro, Spain, and Tunisia. Two of the largest Mediterranean islands belong to Italy, Sardinia in the west and Sicily in the south.   
  The country covers an area of 301,318 km² (116,340 sq. mi.), compared, it is about 80% the size of Japan or slightly larger than the U.S. state of Arizona.   
  Italy has a population of more than 60.4 million people (in 2019), the capital and largest city is Rome (Italian: Roma). Other major cities are Florence, Milan, Naples, and Venice. Spoken language is (only) Italian.   
  The country is known for its food, wine, ice cream, art, antique architecture, gardens, opera, fast expensive cars, fashion, film, football, and “Dolce Vita”, a life of exuberant pleasure and luxury.   
   
   Italy became a nation-state belatedly in 1861, when the city-states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL.   
   An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II.  
   A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946, and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the European Monetary Union in 1999.  

  About Rome   
 Rome, Italian Roma, the historic city and capital of Roma province, of Lazio region , and of the country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.   
  The province of Rome is a matching frame for the many treasures of the capital, and the surrounding area has, more or less directly, experienced the influence of the history of the Eternal City.   
  A region with a great deal to offer: sea, nature, good food and villages rich in history and art. The sea, the hills, lakes, rivers and vineyards: the surroundings of Rome offer a kaleidoscope of diversity and attractions for nature lovers.   
     
  Interesting Facts   
   
 Modern Rome has 280 fountains and more than 900 churches. 
  Nearly 700,000 euros worth of coins are tossed into Rome's Trevi Fountain each year. The proceeds are donated to Caritas to help those in need. 
  The Romans had built a road network of 53,000 miles by the early fourth century. Each Roman mile was about 4,800 feet and marked by a milestone, giving birth to the saying “All roads lead to Rome.” 
  The mascot of Rome is a she-wolf that cared for brothers Romulus and Remus, the mythological founders of Rome. 
  Rome became the capital city of unified Italy in 1870, taking the title from Florence. 
  The first ever shopping mall was built in Rome between 107 and 110 AD by Emperor Trajan. It sold a wide variety of goods and grocery items. 
  Rome's first university, La Sapienza, established in 1303 AD, is the largest in Europe and the second largest in the world. 
  Rome has a museum dedicated entirely to pasta. 
  St Peter's basilica inside Vatican City is the largest church ever constructed. 
  Italy has a population of more than 60.4 million people (in 2019), the capital and largest city is Rome (Italian: Roma). Other major cities are Florence, Milan, Naples, and Venice. Spoken language is (only) Italian.   
  The country is known for its food, wine, ice cream, art, antique architecture, gardens, opera, fast expensive cars, fashion, film, football, and “Dolce Vita”, a life of exuberant pleasure and luxury.

6. Conference SEC_3:
IEEE websites place cookies on your device to give you the best user experience. By using our websites, you agree to the placement of these cookies. To learn more, read our Privacy Policy.   Accept & Close    

  Submitted papers must be no longer than 12 pages, but excluding references. The 12-page limit includes all the content such as figures, tables, appendix,etc.    
  
  Accepted papers will be eligible for two additional pages at a cost of $100 per page.   
  
  Submitting a Paper  
 SEC takes a broad view of edge computing and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice that embrace any aspect of edge computing.   

 Topics include, but are not limited to:   
  
  communication infrastructure (e.g., cellular, satellite, LoRa) for edge computing 
  distributed ledger technology (DLT) & blockchain at the edge 
  socio-economic aspects of edge computing 
  edge computing as an enabler of 5G applications and services 
  edge computing infrastructure (e.g., IoT hubs) and its sustainability 
  emerging applications at the edge, such as the metaverse, smart environments, and remote sensing 
  geo-distributed analytics and indexing on edge nodes 
  hardware architectures for edge computing and devices 
  monitoring, measurements, management, and diagnosis in edge computing 
  networking, e.g., from clients to the edge, and from the edge to the cloud 
  programming models and toolkits 
  resource management, scalability, and reliability for edge computing 
  security and privacy issues 
  storage and data management technologies for edge computing 
  techniques and algorithms for machine learning and AI at the edge 
  edge-enabled applications, such as in vehicular, enterprise, and manufacturing systems 
  Submissions that include systems implementation and their performance evaluation are particularly encouraged.  

 The review process will be double-blind. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A best paper award will be presented to one or more outstanding papers from the conference. We also welcome short Position Papers on any of the above topics, which will be judged separately from papers in the research track of the conference. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. Papers must be in PDF format and must be submitted through:  
 https://sec24.hotcrp.com/  . No email submissions will be accepted.  

 Submission Instructions  
  
  Submitted papers must be no longer than 12 single-spaced 8.5" x 11" pages, including figures and tables, but excluding references, and using 10-point type on 11-point (single-spaced) leading, two-column format, Times Roman, or a similar font, within a text block 6.5" wide x 9" deep. IEEE Standard template for Latex and Word meet these specifications and can be found at: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html  .  
  
  Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings. Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible in black and white, without requiring magnification. Papers so short as to be considered "extended abstracts" will not receive full consideration.  

 Reviewing will be double-blind. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication; for example, cite prior work as though it belongs to a third party. Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact the program co-chairs well in advance of the submission deadline.  

  Papers must be in PDF format and must be submitted via HotCRP. Papers will receive reviews, after which papers will either proceed to a second round of reviewing or be immediately rejected. Papers that are reviewed in the second round will then have their reviews made available so that authors may provide brief responses. The dates for the early rejection and rebuttal periods are indicated in the table.  

  Reviewing Process with One-shot Revision  
 SEC’24 has one submission deadline. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous SEC conferences. The review decisions will be one of the following:   

 Accept  : Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd. 
  Reject  : Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to the SEC. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at SEC less than 11 months ago, please email a detailed list of differences and if possible a copy of a previous submission to the chairs.

 SEAMS  
  
 Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems  
 The annual symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS) attempts to consolidate interest within the software engineering community on self-adaptive, self-managing, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-configuring, and self-organizing systems. The aim of SEAMS is to discuss progress and challenges in this important area of software engineering.  
 SEAMS is a co-located event to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  . The first SEAMS workshop was held at ICSE 2006. After five very successful years as a workshop, SEAMS became a Symposium co-located with ICSE in 2011. In 2021, SEAMS was ranked in CORE (A ranking)  . In 2024, SEAMS became a Conference co-located with ICSE.

  PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION   
 Papers should neither have been published elsewhere nor be currently under review at another venue. All papers for IEEE SECON 2024 must be submitted via the conference submission system. Each submission must be no longer than 9 pages (including all the figures, references, and appendices) and in font size of 10 points. Submissions that violate the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review.  
 All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.  
 Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats at https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8, and use the preamble:  
 \documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{IEEEtran}  
 Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. A smaller font size, up to 8pt, is allowed for reference pages. You can ignore any warning of the submission system for the reference pages.  
 If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size). Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper in the Adobe PDF format.  
 The paper must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color.  
 The organizers of IEEE SECON 2024 as well as our attendees expect accepted papers to be presented at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.

  PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION   
 Papers should neither have been published elsewhere nor be currently under review at another venue. All papers for IEEE SECON 2024 must be submitted via the conference submission system. Each submission must be no longer than 9 pages (including all the figures, references, and appendices) and in font size of 10 points. Submissions that violate the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review.  
 All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.  
 Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats at https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8, and use the preamble:  
 \documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{IEEEtran}  
 Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. A smaller font size, up to 8pt, is allowed for reference pages. You can ignore any warning of the submission system for the reference pages.  
 If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size). Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper in the Adobe PDF format.  
 The paper must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color.  
 The organizers of IEEE SECON 2024 as well as our attendees expect accepted papers to be presented at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.

 To give all presenters and viewers of SecureComm 2024 the best possible experience under these new circumstances, we kindly ask authors who will pre-record their presentations to comply with the technical specifications outlined below.  
 All video submissions will be verified for video/audio quality by EAI and we strongly recommend that you submit your presentation well ahead of the submission deadline. This will allow time for EAI to verify your submission quickly, and for you to re-record and re-submit it in case it does not meet the technical specifications.  
 – For video, capture a single screen  with your presentation/slides in full screen  . Advance the slides as if presenting normally. Video feed of the presenter (such as via webcam) is not required  .  
  – For audio, we recommend using an external microphone whenever possible. Using the microphone built into your webcam and/or laptop is also acceptable, but please ensure that you minimize ambient noise.  
  – Use free screen capture software, such as ShareX (download at https://getsharex.com/  ) or similar. If using ShareX, please see the attached document “ShareX instructions.pdf” for instructions.  
  – If using other recording software, please make sure to record the video in 1080p resolution (or your maximum screen resolution) and at 30 frames per second in the MP4 video format.  
  – Your presentation should be at least 15 minutes in length but should not exceed 20 minutes. It must be voiced in clear and understandable English. The filename must be the title of your paper.  
   – Before submitting your presentation to us, please send it to your friends or colleagues for review and ask them to confirm that the slides are legible and that the audio is clear.  
  – To submit your recording, upload your video file to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive, WeTransfer, DropBox, CoreMail or a similar service and send the download link to the Conference Manager at [email protected]    .  

 ShareX Instructions:  

 1. Download ShareX from https://getsharex.com/, install, and run the program. The installation or the initial setup will ask you to download “ffmpeg.exe”. Allow it download.

 a. Go to your Desktop (minimize all open applications).   
 b. Open ShareX.  
  c. Click “Capture” in the top left (highlighted) and select “Screen recording” (see Screenshot 2)  
 – Each day of the conference has a separate meeting scheduled with its own ID and Passcode.  
  – You may join the meeting either by clicking the Join link in the email you received, or by entering the Meeting ID in the Zoom client.  
  – If you are joining right before the scheduled conference start, you will be put into the Waiting Room along with all other attendees. Everyone will be admitted to the Meeting a few minutes before the scheduled start.  
  – If you are joining after the scheduled start, you will be asked to enter a Passcode. The Passcode usually has the format of a six-figure number and you will find it in the same email that contains all other joining information.  
  – All participants join the Meeting with their webcam on and the microphone off. Feel free to say hi after you join, but please remember to keep your microphone muted during the conference sessions.  

 d. ShareX will now ask you to specify the recording region of your screen. To record the full screen (see Screenshot 3), navigate the target to one of the top corners of the screen until W: and H: read 1920 and 1080, or your maximum screen resolution.  
  Please note: full screen selection is only possible when all applications are minimized (see step 3 a.)   

 e. Once you have selected the screen region, ShareX will begin recording immediately. This will be signified by the red dot in your taskbar (bottom left corner, see Screenshot 4). To stop recording, click the red dot once. Your video file will be saved automatically.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  - 
  Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.  
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.  
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025.  
 Area of interest include:  
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
  approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
  formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
  analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
  scalability of formal method applications 
  integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
  model-based engineering approaches; 
  correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
  application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
  formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
  formal methods in a certification context 
  case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
  experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
  guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
  usability of formal methods. 
    
 Call for Papers  
  
 We accept papers in three categories:  
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
  Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
  Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
  All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).  
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.  
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template  , specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year.  
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 use the following HotCRP link  .  
 Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers   
 As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties.  
 PAPER SELECTION   
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity.  
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request.  
 PUBLICATION   
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings.

  The authors of the poster papers will only present their papers at the conference.  
 Papers accepted in the first 2 categories will be invited for presentation at the conference. Posters will be illustrated by the authors in separate poster sessions.  
 Submissions are required to report on original, unpublished work and should not be submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct).  
 Proceedings   
 The post-proceedings of FSEN 2025 will be published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS series. Following the tradition of FSEN, we plan to have a special issue of the Science of Computer Programming journal devoted to FSEN 2025 (to be confirmed). After the conference a selection of papers will be invited for this special issue. The invited papers should be extended and will undergo a new round of review by an international program committee. Please see the websites of previous editions of FSEN for more information on post-proceedings and special issues related to those editions.  
 Note from Springer: Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

  FSEN 2025 - Fundamentals of Software Engineering  
   
 About FSEN   
 FSEN is an international conference that aims to bring together researchers, engineers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry to present and discuss their research work in the area of formal methods for software engineering. This conference seeks to facilitate the transfer of experience, adaptation of methods, and where possible, foster collaboration among different groups. The topics of interest cover all aspects of formal methods, especially those related to advancing the application of formal methods in the software industry and promoting their integration with practical engineering techniques. Following the success of the previous FSEN editions ( https://fsen.ir/  ), the next edition of the FSEN conference will take place in Västerås, Sweden, 2025.

  Contributions must be written in English, should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style (LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates) that can be found here and not exceed the page limit for the category (including figures and references).  
 Each submission will be thoroughly reviewed by at least three reviewers considering scientific originality, significance, relevance to the FSEN conference, technical soundness, clarity, self-containedness and discussion of appropriate related work.  
 The reviewers will be asked to rate the submissions and evaluate whether they can be accepted as: full paper or short paper for the LNCS proceedings.  
  The authors of the poster papers will only present their papers at the conference.  
 Papers accepted in the first 2 categories will be invited for presentation at the conference. Posters will be illustrated by the authors in separate poster sessions.  
 Submissions are required to report on original, unpublished work and should not be submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct).  
 Proceedings   
 The post-proceedings of FSEN 2025 will be published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS series. Following the tradition of FSEN, we plan to have a special issue of the Science of Computer Programming journal devoted to FSEN 2025 (to be confirmed). After the conference a selection of papers will be invited for this special issue. The invited papers should be extended and will undergo a new round of review by an international program committee. Please see the websites of previous editions of FSEN for more information on post-proceedings and special issues related to those editions.  
 Note from Springer: Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 ACM SenSys 2025  
  6 - 9 May  Irvine, USA   
 The 23rd ACM Conference on  
  Embedded Networked Sensor Systems   
 In transition to Conference on  
  Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems    

 Announcement from the Joint  
  SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee  
 We are excited to announce the merger of three leading conferences — ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and ACM/IEEE IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new name SenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems  . This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   
 ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

 Submission Guidelines:  
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages  with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here  . LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.  
   
  Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.

Short papers will be evaluated based on the originality of their ideas, potential impact, and clarity of presentation, even without extensive evaluations. Similar to full papers, accepted short papers will be presented orally at the conference.   
   
 Submission Guidelines:  
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages  with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here  . LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.  
   
  Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.

 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE SERVICES ENGINEERING  
  SSE 2025  

 Software as a service (SaaS) – a framework for encapsulating and delivering applications as services has been a very popular architecture of choice for many business applications. Instead of installing and maintaining software, services are accessed on the cloud, avoiding complex and costly software and hardware management. The framework has been a great success primarily due to how it allows for cost-effective modular service requirements decomposition and modular service composition during the development, operation, maintenance, and evolution of the encapsulated software and the underlying computing platform.  
 But despite the successes and unparalleled popularity, next-generation software services are increasingly pressured to become more than just encapsulated code with a service interface. Demands abound for such services to be context and situation-aware, driven by behaviour observed and captured from both the environment and humans, intrinsically modifying their service delivery behaviour accordingly. They are also expected to be self-aware and autonomous, sentient of their own offerings and intelligent enough to reason about other opportunities that can be afforded by teaming and bonding with other self-aware services. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), services are further required to be ultra-mobile, ultra-fine-grained, ultra-trustworthy, and ultra-intelligent, capable of learning from their own data as well as their peers. Such IoT services must survive the presence of unavoidable uncertainties from the data, the analytics, and the environment, and must cope with unpredictable ambiguities brought about by end-user interactions.  
 Moreover, human-centric concerns in service design are expanding beyond the traditional focus to include developers, operators and end-users, alike, in the end-to-end process of developing, deploying, managing and evolving such services as the underlying technologies change and evolve.  
 Next generation software services are therefore anticipated to be the superheroes that, in addition to encapsulating service code, do somehow apply state-of-the-art techniques that cut across the areas of service computing, machine learning, software engineering, pervasive computing, IoT, dependable computing, psychophysiological or brain science, autonomics, among others, to support the emerging cutting-edge applications of the future. Recognizing the need for a disruptive approach to enabling next generation software services, the IEEE World Congress on Services has taken a first step by dedicating a special symposium organised by academic and industrial leaders from the software engineering and services computing communities to chart a way forward. The International Symposium on Advances in Software Services Engineering which was held in 2021 and 2022, has concluded with a set of recommendations, which is a cross-cutting declaration and a manifesto of a new field of study named Software Service Engineering (SSE), based on the prevalent body of knowledge and professional practices of software engineering methods and tools, as well as advances in the other disciplines as described above. Based on these recommendations, the International Conference on Software Services Engineering (SSE) was established as a replacement of the Congress’ previous Conference on Service Computing (IEEE SCC). It was inaugurated in 2023 in Chicago, USA, to further establish this field and to organise the participation and contributions of its constituent R&D communities.

 The IEEE International Congress on Intelligent and Service-Oriented Systems Engineering (CISOSE) is the premier event on service-oriented systems and the practices involving these systems. Technology has the power to do many things, and changing the world is one of them. Innovations and new technologies are changing the daily lives of each and every one of us. Many things that were mere visions of the future yesterday are now a reality. Meanwhile, we are surrounded by technology at every moment of our lives. After a long journey that began in 2005 with the IEEE International Workshop on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE’05), in 2015 CISOSE has become an IEEE International Congress on Intelligent and Service-Oriented Systems Engineering (CISOSE).  
 Since then, CISOSE groups six conferences that cover the whole range of Service-Oriented System Engineering and its Applications, from Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to Distributed, Cloud and Mobile systems. It also organizes the IEEE Future Technology Summit, which focuses on the challenges and issues of building sustainable smart cities and living environments using smart IOT technologies, big data, and machine learning solutions.  
 The IEEE International Congress on Intelligent and Service-Oriented Systems Engineering is successfully organized on an annual basis either in the Americas, in Europe, or in Asia and constitutes a platform and venue for the wider community of Service-Oriented Systems Engineering and Distributed and Mobile Systems enthusiasts.  
 To address the current breakthrough of AI and Smart Machines and the future technology needs for flexible, scalable, and efficient infrastructures, the CISOSE 2025 will be held in Tucson, Arizona in order to allow academic researchers, industry leaders, major technology providers, and solution players from around the world to gather and exchange ideas, problems and solutions.  
 IEEE International Congress On Intelligent And Service-Oriented Systems Engineering will feature excellent keynote speakers and panelists in several parallel program tracks. Smart Cities and Big Data, as well as a showcase of real-world solutions in academia and industry. Chain technologies of the future. The future of AI and machine learning. In addition, there will be an exhibition of solutions for solution providers and university researchers.  
 The event explores innovative methods and practices in Service-Oriented Systems Engineering. CISOSE promotes discussion and interaction among researchers and practitioners about the development of maintainable systems, as well as the improvement, evolution, migration, and reengineering of existing systems. CISOSE will feature multiple tracks with technical research paper sessions and a workshop.  
 CISOSE 2025 is represented by six co-located conferences, including:  
 IEEE JCC 2025, the 16th IEEE International Conference on Jointcloud Computing. 
  IEEE SOSE 2025, the 19th IEEE International Conference On Service-Oriented System Engineering. 
  IEEE BigDataService 2025, the 11th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Machine Learning Applications.

 IEEE Conference Publications  

 Many IEEE conferences provide technology professionals with opportunities to share, collaborate, and gain recognition for their work through publication in the IEEE Xplore  ® Digital Library. IEEE’s Conference Publications Program (CPP) facilitates the acquisition of conference proceedings and post-conference distribution of content.  

 Learn the Guidelines  

 Conferences are eligible to participate in CPP upon approval of their IEEE sponsorship application. For conferences interested in participating in CPP, identifying a publications chair is an essential first step. The process for acquisition of conference proceedings tracks across the life-cycle of the conference. As always, CEE is here to help organizers successfully move through that process to ensure proceedings are IEEE Xplore  ®-ready.  

 IEEE Conference Publications Start Here
