   Motivation        
   
 Show Motivation    
 The Dagstuhl Seminar Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming  (AAIP'17) is a follow-up to the successful seminars 15442 ( http://www.dagstuhl.de/15442  ) and 13502 ( http://www.dagstuhl.de/13502  ) and is the 7th AAIP event overall (started as AAIP'05 as ICML workshop).  
 The term 'inductive programming' (IP) was coined in 2005 for the first AAIP event as a common label for inductive logic programming (ILP) and inductive functional programming. IP research addresses the problem of learning (mostly declarative) programs from incomplete specifications, such as input/output examples, observed traces, or constraints. Beginning in the 1960-ies, this area of research was initiated in artificial intelligence (AI) exploring the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification. Furthermore, applications of AI for software engineering are investigated resulting in methodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process. Inductive programming can be seen as generalization of current machine learning where the hypothesis space consists of classes of computer programs. Approaches to inductive programming are gaining interest in the machine learning community as the need for interpretability, verification, and debugging of learnt models (programs) is growing.  
 Researchers working on IP are distributed over different communities, especially inductive logic programming, evolutionary programming, grammar inference, functional programming, and programming languages and verification. Furthermore, similar approaches are of interest in programming by demonstration applications for end-user programming as well as in cognitive models of inductive learning.  
 Interest in IP has been steadily growing over the last years. One reason is that with the release of FlashFill as a plug-in tool for Microsoft Excel there exists a convincing demonstration that inductive programming research has matured in such a way that commercial applications become feasible. Another one is that researchers in artificial intelligence and in machine learning are becoming more and more interested in comprehensible and explainable systems and inductive programming approaches provide symbolic representations of rules.  
 A long-term objective of the seminar series is to establish inductive programming as a self-contained research topic in artificial intelligence, especially as a field of machine learning and of cognitive modeling.  
 The seminar serves as community building event by bringing together researchers from different areas of inductive programming {especially inductive logic programming and inductive functional programming {, from different application areas such as end-user programming and tutoring, and from cognitive science research, especially from cognitive models of inductive (concept) learning. In this meeting we are open to discussions of the relationship between IP and other forms of machine learning including, for instance, neuro-symbolic learning. For successful community building we seek to balance junior and senior researchers, and to mix researchers from universities and from industry.  
 The two previous seminars resulted in new collaborations between researchers from different back-grounds as documented in joint publications and we expect that the collaborations will continue, deepen and extend, resulting not only in further joint publications but also in joint research projects.  
 In this seminar, we plan to continue and extend discussion addressing the following aspects:  
 Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning. 
  Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems. 
  Discussing current applications of inductive programming in end-user programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application. 
  Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming.

  Summary        
   
 Show Summary    
 Inductive programming (IP) addresses the automated or semi-automated generation of computer programs from incomplete information such as input-output examples, constraints, computation traces, demonstrations, or problem-solving experience [5]. The generated - typically declarative - program has the status of a hypothesis which has been generalized by induction. That is, inductive programming can be seen as a special approach to machine learning. In contrast to standard machine learning, only a small number of training examples is necessary. Furthermore, learned hypotheses are represented as logic or functional programs, that is, they are represented on symbol level and therefore are inspectable and comprehensible [17, 8, 18]. On the other hand, inductive programming is a special approach to program synthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches [20, 14, 2]. In cases where synthesis of specific algorithm details that are hard to figure out by humans inductive reasoning can be used to generate program candidates from either user-provided data such as test cases or from data automatically derived from a formal specification [16].  
 Inductive program synthesis is of interest for researchers in artificial intelligence since the late sixties [1]. On the one hand, the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification are investigated, on the other hand methodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process are explored. One of the most relevant areas of application of inductive programming techniques is end-user programming [3, 12, 4]. For example, the Microsoft Excel plug-in Flashfill synthesizes programs from a small set of observations of user behavior [8, 7, 6]. Related applications are in process mining and in data wrangling [11]. Inductive programming in general offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data [15, 13] and to learning from observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents [10, 17]. Furthermore, inductive programming can be applied in the context of teaching programming [19, 21].  
 Recent Trends and Applications  
 When the first Dagstuhl Seminar on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming took place in 2013, the following trends could be identified:  
 Combining different approaches to inductive programming to leverage their complementary strengths. 
  New inductive programming approaches based on adapting and using well-developed techniques such as SAT-solving. 
  Putting inductive programming to application, for example in the areas of automated string manipulations in spreadsheets or web programming. 
  Applying concepts of inductive programming to cognitive models of learning structural concepts. 
  The main outcomes of the second seminar were (1) a joint publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal with respect to the evaluation of computational models solving intelligence test problems – among them inductive programming systems [9], (2) a joint publication addressing comprehensibility as a second criterium to evaluate machine learning approaches besides accuracy [18], and (3) a NIPS’2016 workshop on Neural Nets and Program Induction.  
 Based on the results of the second seminar, the focus of the third seminar has been on the following aspects:  
 Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning. 
  Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems. 
  Discussing current applications of inductive programming in enduser programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application. 
  Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming. 
  In the seminar, we brought together researchers from different areas of computer science - especially from machine learning, AI, declarative programming, and software engineering - and researchers from cognitive psychology interested in inductive learning as well as in teaching and learning computer programming. Furthermore, participants from industry presented current as well as visionary applications for inductive programming.  
 The seminar was opened with lecture style talks introducing the four major approaches of inductive programming: Inductive functional programming, inductive logic programming, inductive probabilistic logical programming, and programming by example.  
 Talks covered current developments of IP algorithms, challenging applications -especially in data wrangling and in education -, and relations of IP to cognition.  
 In addition, several system demons and tutorials were given: Igor and EasyIgor (by Sebastian Seufert and Ute Schmid), MagicHaskeller (by Susumu Katayama), Sketch (by Armando Solar-Lezama), PROSE (by Oleksandr Polozov), Slipcover (by Fabrizio Riguzzi), and TaCLe (by Luc De Raedt).  
 The following topics were identified and further discussed in working groups during the seminar:  
 How to determine relevancy of background knowledge to reduce search? 
  Integrating IP with other types of machine learning, especially Deep Learning? 
  Data wrangling as exiting area of application. 
  Additional topics identified as relevant have been anomaly detection, noise, robustnes, as well as non-example based interaction (e.g., natural language).  
 Concluding remarks and future plans  
 In the wrapping-up section, we collected answers to the question  
  “What would constitute progress at Dagstuhl 2019?”  
   
 The most prominent answers were  
 make available systems, data sets (via IP webpage) 
  compare systems 
  common vocabulary, work on applications attempted by others: drawing problems, string transformation, general ai challenge, benchmarks starexec, learn robot strategy, grammar learning what is inductive programming 
  open problems 
  As the grand IP challenge we came up with: An IP program should invent an algorithm publishable in a serious journal (e.g., an integer factorization algorithm) or win a programming competition!

  JOURNAL   Call for Papers: Special Issue on "Immersive Learning: From Theory to Practice, Building Evidence-Based Frameworks"    The manuscript submission deadline has been extended to December 15, 2025.  
  We are happy to announce a Call for Papers for a special issue in the journal "Computers & Education: X Reality", which is organized with iLRN and invites selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th iLRN conferences to submit extended versions. However, submissions from the academic community are welcomed, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Overview  
  The integration of immersive technologies—such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—into educational environments has shown significant potential to transform the learning experience. However, the rapid adoption of these technologies has outpaced the development of comprehensive, evidence-based frameworks that guide their practical implementation and evaluation in diverse educational contexts.  
  Immersive Learning is emerging from multi-disciplinary research in Computer Science, Game Design, UX, the Learning Sciences, and other fields that apply Immersive Learning in context. This special issue of Computers & Education: X Reality aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice in immersive learning by bringing together research that explores theoretical foundations and builds robust frameworks grounded in empirical evidence. We seek contributions that provide insights into how immersive technologies can be systematically integrated into educational settings to enhance learning outcomes, showing effective practices in immersive learning, addressing educational challenges and the technical affordances of tools and frameworks that are both scalable and sustainable.  
  This special issue is organized with the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN). Selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th annual International Conferences will be invited to submit extended versions to this Special Issue. Extended versions of papers submitted to the iLRN Conference must contain about 50% new material, and the title must clearly and unmistakably differ from the title of the article presented at the conference.  
  Likewise, we welcome submissions from the academic community, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Topics of Interest  
  This special issue invites scholars, practitioners, and technologists to contribute to the evolving landscape of immersive learning by providing research that advances theoretical understanding and offers practical, evidence-based solutions for educators worldwide.  
  We invite high-quality, original research articles, case studies, and review papers that address, but are not limited to, the following topics:  
  Theoretical Foundations  
  Conceptual models and frameworks for immersive learning. Cognitive, social, and emotional theories underlying immersive learning environments. Ethical considerations and inclusivity in immersive learning. Practical Applications  
  Case studies showcasing the integration of immersive technologies in various educational settings. Design and development of immersive learning environments. Best practices for implementing VR/AR/MR in classrooms, labs, and remote learning contexts. Evidence-Based Frameworks  
  Empirical studies evaluating the effectiveness of immersive learning tools and environments. Longitudinal studies on the impact of immersive learning on student engagement, motivation, and outcomes. Frameworks for assessing and improving the accessibility and usability of immersive learning technologies. Technological Innovations

  GUIDED VIRTUAL ADVENTURE   Dive into VR Storytelling with novelist Helen Lundström Erwin!    Join us on October 24, 2024 at 9 am Pacific / 12 pm Eastern / 4 pm GMT for an exciting Guided Virtual Adventure about VR Storytelling! We are delighted to welcome Helen Lundström Erwin as our guide. This adventure will be hosted by Amany Alkhayat in Engage VR. The Engage event code is 2a0K6. The code contains a zero, not the letter O. If you are new to Engage, you can create an Engage account here: https://engagevr.io/download-engage/ Helen Lundström Erwin is recognized as the only novelist with a VR World based on a setting in their own novel. Her historical novel Sour Milk in Sheep’s Wool not only explores the early reproductive rights and suffrage movements but also inspired her VR World, The Foremothers Café. This VR Café takes you back in time to Lund, Sweden in 1918. Just like in the story, it serves as a community space for women, where Helen hosts discussions and cultural events, extending the themes of her writing into a dynamic, interactive environment. Her latest work, The Lure of Water and Wood, marks her foray into historical fantasy, drawing from real sorcery trials in 17th and 18th century Sweden, blending meticulous research with imaginative storytelling. Helen’s first novel, James’ Journey, further showcases her ability to weave deep historical insights into compelling narratives, portraying the transformative journey of a man from a pro-slavery upbringing to a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Helen has created artwork for The Foremothers Café and illustrated her Children's Book, Officer Helga Hedgehog Meets the New Neighbors. She is an active member of the Historical Novel Society-New York Chapter and of XR Women. She was honored with a 2021 (SWEA) Mona Johnson - New York Scholarship, and received a grant from The Puffin Foundation. The Foremothers Café has been nominated for Auggie Awards for Best Social Impact two years in a row, and Helen was nominated for an XR Women Award in the Trailblazing Category in 2023. Helen now serves as Secretary of the Board of SWEA (Swedish Women's Educational Association.) 
  VIRTUAL CAMPUS   Our iLRNetwork Virtual Campus is open!    University student use of the iLRN Virtual Campus XR groups meet for presentations & exploration iLRN Volunteers starting Campus Co-design - now building a spooky Halloween party! Beginning construction of iLRN's Foundations Research Library on campus on the immersive learning principles of Computer Science, Games, & the Learning Sciences Our new iLRN Frame VR Campus opened to attendees of the 10th annual iLRN Conference last June 2024. Of the collection of 25 Frame buildings on the new campus, most iLRN2024 activity took place on the dual Frame campus "hub" - that is, our Orange and Blue Exhibit Halls, respectively - where presenters from BOTH online and face-to-face (Scotland) conference venues had opportunity to place a poster and interact with visitors. Note that both virtual campus halls are always open to iLRN members and these fantastic immersive learning posters are still there for your perusal!  
  Indeed, the campus is crawling with network activity, as various initiatives sprout up in Teaching/Learning, UX/Design, and Research/Knowledge Sharing!  
  A few iLRN Frame VR Campus Highlights:  
   
  Summer '24, Doug Wilson invited his Learning, Design, and Technology students at George Mason University to meet regularly in our iLRN Student Center and explore the network co-designed FrameVR Campus. Dr. Wilson and iLRN campus staff offered the use of Frame VR's custom permissions to allow students an opportunity to pitch ideas, co-create and try out the campus' possibility spaces. > > > >  
   
  Wilson says, "FrameVR and the iLRN Student Center make great tools and provide quintessential presence to engage students on a range of topics in the instructional design space. A nimble system, graduate students swiftly got up to speed with FrameVR's easy to use tools and took part in compelling direct instruction as well as sensory experiences. Richter's presentation on the UN Sustainable Development Goals allowed students to align their creative design projects in XR with the iLRN conference theme Tech 4 Good; this introduced a high level of engagement for students who could then see their work from a global perspective and design with the greater good in mind. One student even chose to build a new virtual office for me in Frame VR as her design project! The authentic learning experiences possible in Frame VR and the iLRN Student Center underscored teaching and learning approaches illuminated in learning in activity (Engstrom, 2022), Community of Inquiry (Garrison , 2017) and situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Perhaps the most intriguing piece happened this fall at the Immersive Technology Conference on the George Mason University Arlington Campus. I setup a 60” flat screen connected to my MacBook Pro and invited students from as far away as Los Angeles to pop into Frame VR ILRN Student Center and interact live with the audience during my poster session. Student avatars in VR interacted live and face-to-face with people viewing on the big screen, a portal and intersection of the virtual and physical worlds! That was an engaging and unique experience and all with no headsets or goggles. FrameVR lowers the barriers to entry, and the global iLRN Student Center was the space! I can’t thank you and iLRN enough for making this all possible!  
  The Immersive Learning Research Network's campus is open to university member/partners in myriad different ways!  
  game jams or hackathons research talks independent student projects pedagogical or computer science design experiments international co-lab spaces In other campus activity, Randall Rode brought the EduCAUSE XR Community Group to the iLRN campus in August for exploration and discussion in the Circle of Scholars (CoS) amphitheater. Dr. Rode is presently supporting iLRN to co-develop our Community of Scholars in Immersive Learning, including public and members-only meetings in the CoS amphitheater.  
   
  > > > > > Bring YOUR immersive experience design group or team to the iLRN Campus for exploration or meeting!  
   
  Now that fall semester has arrived and universities are well underway with courses, the campus has picked up our activity and the iLRN Volunteers are more systematically managing our co-creations and other events on campus. They use our iLRN General Discord Server as a means of collaborating, working across time zones, skill sets, and campus design requests but they're ALWAYS doing something fun too and our twice-a-month meetings are always eye-opening and full of laughter and connections.  
  Lately, we've been working on turning a number of our campus buildings into our "HAUNTED VIRTUAL CAMPUS" - now in our 5th year!  
  (so I guess it's a tradition?). . . .  
   
  We're putting up some cryptic AI bots who speak of VR like a kooky steampunk character and grumpily invite you to check out other haunted spaces and leave them alone to their alarming experiments...  
   
  and finally, our lead iLRN Campus Volunteer Sarah Barker has been building a prototype Frame VR Research Library in our House 1, the "trunk" of our Knowledge Tree representing the BIG THREE disciplines that fundamentally contribute to hiqh quality Immersive Learning experiences: (1) Computer Science, (2) UX/Game Design and (3) The Learning Sciences. We are so excited of the possibilities of Sarah's contribution (check out her work on our Affiliate Partner's XR Women's Frame VR space!) and look to similarly build out 12 applied areas in Frames across our campus:  
  dddd

 Submit the Special Session Proposal  

 The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025 solicits proposals for special sessions, within the technical scope of IJCNN 2025. Special sessions aim to provide focused discussions on innovative and emerging topics in neural networks and related fields. Cross-fertilization of disciplines and emerging areas are strongly encouraged.   

 SPECIAL SESSION RULES  
 Timeline:  the paper submissions for Special Sessions follow the same deadlines of regular papers. 
  Special Session Papers:  Special Sessions receive papers up to 8 pages, according to the IJCNN 2025 regular paper rules. Papers submitted to Special Sessions will undergo a regular review process. Accepted papers will be published in the IJCNN 2025 proceedings. 
  Number of Papers for Author:  No author may appear in more than two articles in a single special session. 
  Special Session Chair:  At least one of the organizers must attend and chair the special session. 
  Special Session Attendance:  At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to present it in person. 
  Special Sessions at IJCNN 2025:  Only special sessions with 5 papers accepted will be included in the program of IJCNN 2025. In the other cases, accepted papers will be moved to regular sessions. To avoid multiple special sessions on similar topics, an accepted proposal will likely be paired with similar proposals. 

 PROPOSAL SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  
 Prospective Special Session organizers are expected to submit a proposal document, including the following information:   
 Title of the Special Session 
  List of organizers with names, affiliations and personal websites (or Google Scholar profiles) 
  Email of the primary contact person 
  Abstract (max 4,000 characters) highlighting the motivations, objectives, novelty, relevance to IJCNN 2025, and potential impact of the topic covered by the special session 
  Link to previous editions of this special session (optional) 
  Title, list of authors, and short abstracts of at least five committed papers (optional but highly recommended) 
  List of potential reviewers for Special Session papers (mandatory after acceptance of the proposal) 
  Special Session proposals must be submitted as pdf files via the  IJCNN 2025 CMT System    .   

 PROPOSAL SELECTION  
 Special session proposals will be evaluated based on:   
 Proposed topic 
  Relevance with the conference 
  Novelty of the topic 
  Expected impact and quality of the contributed papers 
  Background and diversity of the session organizer(s) and contributing authors

 Feedback  Survey  

 The mathematical theory and practice of both cryptography and coding underpins the provision of effective security and reliability for data communication, processing and storage. This nineteenth International Conference in an established and successful IMA series on the theme of “Cryptography and Coding” solicits original research papers on all technical aspects of cryptography and coding.  
  Submissions are welcome on any cryptographic or coding-theoretic topic including, but not limited to:  
  • Foundational theory and mathematics;  
  • The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic or coding primitives and protocols  
  • Secure implementation and optimisation in hardware or software; and  
  • Applied aspects of cryptography and coding.  
  
 Invited Speakers  
 Carla Ràfols (Pompeu Fabra University)   
 Amortization in zkSNARKs   
 Prover complexity is one of the main bottlenecks in some of the best-known succinct, non-interactive arguments. Thus, many works “delay” or amortize parts of these proofs. In this talk, I will overview these techniques and the most recent constructions, and present new applications of these ideas.  
 Dario Fiore (IMDEA Software Institute)   
 Succinct and Functional Vector Commitments   
 Vector commitments are a special class of commitment schemes in which one can commit to a long vector and open single positions of the vector with the crucial property that commitments and openings are short. Functional commitments generalize vector commitments so that one can open, in a succinct way, to functions of the committed vector.  
  In this talk, I will present the notion of functional commitments and the recent constructions of this primitive that support the evaluation of arbitrary circuits, and I will discuss some of their applications.

 ECM Committee: 2025 Call for self-nominations  
   
 The ECM Committee provides a focus for the ideas and activities of early-career IMA members, in addition to engaging, empowering and mobilising this group in supporting the IMA’s charitable aims, including promoting mathematics. Most prominently, the committee collaborates with the wider IMA to organise and run many events for the early career mathematician community, such as Virtual Maths Teas, idea exchanges on teaching in academia, hackathons and mock study groups, a seminar series and a webinar series. These provide a platform for attendees to meet and network with like-minded individuals.  
 Over recent years, the ECM has seen great success and continues to go from strength to strength. This has only been made possible through the hard work and dedication of the ECM Committee. We are therefore looking for enthusiastic and committed ECM members to take up the mantle and work to build on the great work that has been achieved so far. Please note that the committee collaboration mostly takes place online and there is no expectation to volunteer in-person.  
 The posts available for election are:  
 Vice Chair and Chair Designate  – The Vice Chair supports the Chair, arranges committee meetings, and records and circulates committee discussions and actions. The Vice Chair is also the Chair Designate and is expected to take over as the new Chair the following year.  
 The Chair provides leadership and a focus for the group and supports all committee endeavours. The Chair is responsible for leading committee meetings, coordinating responses to emails sent to the IMA ECM email mailbox, and acts as direct liaison with the IMA Council and Secretariat.” The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Vice Chair and Chair Designate, 1 year as Chair, and 1 year as Immediate Past Chair.   
 Event Leader Designate  – The Event Leader Designate shadows and assists the Event Leader in the development of new and existing events for the ECM community.The Event Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Event Leader the following year. The Event Leader is responsible for supporting the leadership of our ECM subgroup to coordinate event organisation over the year. The role is to come up with new ideas for events, connect with maths communities to identify volunteers to support in sessions and facilitate events.  The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Event Leader Designate and 1 year as Event Leader.   
 Engagement Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Engagement Leader Designate shadows and assists the Engagement Leader. The Engagement Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Engagement Leader the following year.  
 The Engagement Leader’s role is to encourage ECM members to participate more actively with the IMA through the promotion of ECM events, encouraging the upgrade of membership and gaining Chartered designation, or encouraging engagement at the local IMA branch level if available. In addition, the Engagement Leader is involved in coordinating the Committee’s communication channels such as regular updates in Mathematics Today, and supporting the development and curation of engagement channels. The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Engagement Leader Designate and 1 year as Engagement Leader.   
 EDI Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate shadows and assists the Diversity and Inclusion Leader. The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Diversity and Inclusion Leader at the end of the 2 year term of the current Diversity and Inclusion Leader (February 2026).  
 The Diversity and Inclusion leader’s role is to ensure the actions of the ECM committee are inline with the wider IMA diversity and inclusion activities. They are to provide oversight on how ECM committee actions may be best implemented to promote Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, and to make sure that any EDI concerns are appropriately addressed. They are to suggest ways the ECM committee can better engage with, and encourage, ECMs from more diverse backgrounds to follow mathematics as a career, become involved with the IMA, and become involved with the ECM committee. The  Diversity and Inclusion  l eader liaises with the IMA’s diversity champion, ECM events leader, and ECM engagement leader to achieve these aims. They also feedback directly to the IMA diversity champion thoughts that the ECM committee has to improve diversity and inclusion in the ECM population, and the IMA as a whole.  The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Diversity and Inclusion Leader and 2 years as Diversity and Inclusion Leader.   
 To put forward a self-nomination for this year’s ECM Committee, please send a short biography¹ and a paragraph outlining which role you are applying for and why you feel you would be a good fit for this position. For reference, you may wish to look at the role outlines and biographies of the current committee on the ECM Committee webpage  . If you would like further information, perhaps about a particular role or the commitment required, please email ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 The deadline for nominations is 23:59 on Wednesday 8th January 2025  . All ECM members who hold an IMA membership of any grade (e.g. Member, Associate Member, Student Member) are eligible, so submit your nominations ASAP! The election period will then run from 13-24 January 2025, during which time all self-nominations received for the above posts will be circulated. IMA ECM members will be eligible to vote for those who they believe best fit these posts. Results are expected to be finalised early in the new year, so that the new committee will be ready to take over by Monday 3 February 2025.  
 Please send nominations to ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 We follow the IMA Diversity Statement, and endeavour to create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere at the committee, with a diverse range of participants. Applicants from groups which are under-represented in the mathematical sciences are particularly encouraged.  
 ¹ By submitting a biography for consideration, you give your consent for it to be used in emails as part of the election process, and in print and on the website should you be successfully elected. Should you be elected a photograph (High-resolution preferred) will also be requested, and used in print and on the website.

  ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2025  
 Madison, Wisconsin, USA  
 October 28-31, 2025  

 The 2025 Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a three-and-a-half day event focusing on Internet measurement and analysis. The conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. IMC 2025 is the 25th in a series  of highly successful Internet Measurement Workshops and Conferences.  
 The ACM IMC 2025 conference will be held from October 28-31, 2025 in Madison, WI, USA.  
 Announcements  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected. As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see the Call for Papers   . Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 ECM Committee: 2025 Call for self-nominations  
   
 The ECM Committee provides a focus for the ideas and activities of early-career IMA members, in addition to engaging, empowering and mobilising this group in supporting the IMA’s charitable aims, including promoting mathematics. Most prominently, the committee collaborates with the wider IMA to organise and run many events for the early career mathematician community, such as Virtual Maths Teas, idea exchanges on teaching in academia, hackathons and mock study groups, a seminar series and a webinar series. These provide a platform for attendees to meet and network with like-minded individuals.  
 Over recent years, the ECM has seen great success and continues to go from strength to strength. This has only been made possible through the hard work and dedication of the ECM Committee. We are therefore looking for enthusiastic and committed ECM members to take up the mantle and work to build on the great work that has been achieved so far. Please note that the committee collaboration mostly takes place online and there is no expectation to volunteer in-person.  
 The posts available for election are:  
 Vice Chair and Chair Designate  – The Vice Chair supports the Chair, arranges committee meetings, and records and circulates committee discussions and actions. The Vice Chair is also the Chair Designate and is expected to take over as the new Chair the following year.  
 The Chair provides leadership and a focus for the group and supports all committee endeavours. The Chair is responsible for leading committee meetings, coordinating responses to emails sent to the IMA ECM email mailbox, and acts as direct liaison with the IMA Council and Secretariat.” The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Vice Chair and Chair Designate, 1 year as Chair, and 1 year as Immediate Past Chair.   
 Event Leader Designate  – The Event Leader Designate shadows and assists the Event Leader in the development of new and existing events for the ECM community.The Event Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Event Leader the following year. The Event Leader is responsible for supporting the leadership of our ECM subgroup to coordinate event organisation over the year. The role is to come up with new ideas for events, connect with maths communities to identify volunteers to support in sessions and facilitate events.  The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Event Leader Designate and 1 year as Event Leader.   
 Engagement Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Engagement Leader Designate shadows and assists the Engagement Leader. The Engagement Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Engagement Leader the following year.  
 The Engagement Leader’s role is to encourage ECM members to participate more actively with the IMA through the promotion of ECM events, encouraging the upgrade of membership and gaining Chartered designation, or encouraging engagement at the local IMA branch level if available. In addition, the Engagement Leader is involved in coordinating the Committee’s communication channels such as regular updates in Mathematics Today, and supporting the development and curation of engagement channels. The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Engagement Leader Designate and 1 year as Engagement Leader.   
 EDI Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate shadows and assists the Diversity and Inclusion Leader. The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Diversity and Inclusion Leader at the end of the 2 year term of the current Diversity and Inclusion Leader (February 2026).  
 The Diversity and Inclusion leader’s role is to ensure the actions of the ECM committee are inline with the wider IMA diversity and inclusion activities. They are to provide oversight on how ECM committee actions may be best implemented to promote Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, and to make sure that any EDI concerns are appropriately addressed. They are to suggest ways the ECM committee can better engage with, and encourage, ECMs from more diverse backgrounds to follow mathematics as a career, become involved with the IMA, and become involved with the ECM committee. The  Diversity and Inclusion  l eader liaises with the IMA’s diversity champion, ECM events leader, and ECM engagement leader to achieve these aims. They also feedback directly to the IMA diversity champion thoughts that the ECM committee has to improve diversity and inclusion in the ECM population, and the IMA as a whole.  The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Diversity and Inclusion Leader and 2 years as Diversity and Inclusion Leader.   
 To put forward a self-nomination for this year’s ECM Committee, please send a short biography¹ and a paragraph outlining which role you are applying for and why you feel you would be a good fit for this position. For reference, you may wish to look at the role outlines and biographies of the current committee on the ECM Committee webpage  . If you would like further information, perhaps about a particular role or the commitment required, please email ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 The deadline for nominations is 23:59 on Wednesday 8th January 2025  . All ECM members who hold an IMA membership of any grade (e.g. Member, Associate Member, Student Member) are eligible, so submit your nominations ASAP! The election period will then run from 13-24 January 2025, during which time all self-nominations received for the above posts will be circulated. IMA ECM members will be eligible to vote for those who they believe best fit these posts. Results are expected to be finalised early in the new year, so that the new committee will be ready to take over by Monday 3 February 2025.  
 Please send nominations to ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 We follow the IMA Diversity Statement, and endeavour to create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere at the committee, with a diverse range of participants. Applicants from groups which are under-represented in the mathematical sciences are particularly encouraged.  
 ¹ By submitting a biography for consideration, you give your consent for it to be used in emails as part of the election process, and in print and on the website should you be successfully elected. Should you be elected a photograph (High-resolution preferred) will also be requested, and used in print and on the website.

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 WELCOME TO IPMV 2025   
 2025 7th International Conference on Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV 2025) will be held in Hong Kong, China on January 10-12, 2025, co-sponsored by Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong and University of Macau.   
 Image Processing and Machine Vision usually plays an important role in the transition from data storage to decision systems based on large databases of signals such as the obtained from sensor networks, internet services, or communication systems. These systems imply developing both computational solutions and novel models. Signals from real-world systems are usually complex such as speech, music, bio-medical, multimedia, among others. Thus, Image Processing and Machine Vision techniques are very useful for these type of systems to automate processing and analysis techniques to retrieve information from data storage.  
 IPMV is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars, professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster working relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It will put special emphasis on the participations of PhD students, Postdoctoral fellows and other young researchers from all over the world. It would be beneficial to bring together a group of experts from diverse fields to discuss recent progress and to share ideas on open questions.  
 You are invited to submit a paper for consideration all over the globe interested in the areas of machine learning methods/ algorithms, signal processing theory and methods, data mining, artificial intelligence, optimization and applications to human brain disorders like epilepsy etc. Other applications of image processing and machine vision techniques are also welcome. Looking forward to welcoming you in Hong Kong!  

 Important DATES:   

 Submission Deadline: November 20, 2024    
 Notification Date: December 10, 2024     
 Registration Date: December 25, 2024     
 Conference Date: January 10-12, 2025     
 ================    
 Note:   Taking into account the various circumstances of the participants, IPMV will adopt all available social media methods, such as online/video presentation, etc, besides the regular presentation styles (oral & poster). The online/video presentation session will be arranged accordingly. Authors who cannot travel to Hong Kong due to some sort of restriction can participate by submitting a recorded presentation and connecting at the time of their session on Zoom.

 Call for Full  Papers   

 India HCI 2025 is the 16th edition of the international conference series on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Sponsored by the HCI Professionals Association of India and in cooperation with ACM’s special interest group on computer-human interaction (SIGCHI), India HCI brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas that include traditional graphical & web user interfaces, tangible & ubiquitous computing, virtual & augmented reality, multimedia, new input & output devices, computer games, privacy, security, visualization, health, accessibility and aging, designing for children with and for special needs, user modeling, engineering interactive systems, ICT for development, CSCW, Explainable Human Centric AI (XAI) and more. India HCI provides a special spotlight on papers that are relevant to South Asia, including those related to culture, language, socio-economic situations, and the industry from the region. The intimate size, single track, and comfortable surroundings make this conference an ideal opportunity to exchange research results and implementation experiences.   
 Submissions are sought that describe original, unpublished work generally in the field of HCI. India HCI uses an anonymous submission process (similar to CHI) for paper submissions. Please consult the India HCI ‘25 Author’s Guide for information on the ACM Paper Format (also mentioned below) and conference policies on previous and simultaneous publications. To preserve anonymity during review, the authors must remove their names and affiliations from the masthead. If authors have conducted relevant prior work, they must cite it appropriately, while also referring to this work in third person. Authors can revise their submissions based on the reviews they receive, prior to submitting their camera-ready manuscripts. Until the camera-readies have been checked off by the program committee, these must be considered conditionally accepted.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the India HCI 2025 Conference Proceedings.   
 To submit, see the   India HCI Electronic Submission site.     

 Conference Theme   

 This year’s conference theme is  “Transhumanism: Improving human condition through technology”  which aims to highlight emerging technologies in HCI that focus on   
 Understanding humans 
  Enabling humans 
  Augmenting humans 
  Replacing humans 
  Being humans 

 Important Dates   

 Full Paper Submission Deadline  - June 10th 2025   
 Initial Notification and Reviews  - August 1st 2025   
 Revised Submission  - August 10th 2025   
 Final Notification  - September 1st 2025   
 Camera Ready Submission  - September 11th 2025   

 Topics of relevance   

 Significantly novel enabling technologies such as innovative input devices, displays, new interaction techniques, or new media that extend the boundaries of traditional interaction, such as natural user interfaces and interactions, mixed reality, mobile interaction, computer games, health, accessibility and aging, user modeling.   We invite  submissions of research papers spanning various areas of HCI and design, including, but not limited to:   
 User Interfaces 
  Tangible & Ubiquitous Computing 
  Virtual & Augmented Reality 
  Multimedia and New Media 
  Natural User Interfaces 
  Interaction Techniques 
  Game Design 
  Privacy and Usable Security 
  Visualization 
  Health, Accessibility, and Aging 
  User Modeling 
  Engineering Interactive Systems 
  ICT for Development 
  Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) 

 Focus and Scope of the Conference   

 Solutions that address various societal challenges, focusing on the social impact of HCI interventions in diverse contexts 
  User studies that engage qualitative or quantitative research methods and/or offer critical perspectives on technology design, deployment, and/or use. 
  Engineering interactive systems design, ubiquitous computing (including wearables), social software, ICT for development (ICTD), and computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW). 
  Innovative user interfaces for complex interaction contexts or challenging applications. Examples include managing large, complex information sets, usable privacy and security, multi-user interaction, crowdsourcing, automotive user experiences and in-vehicle interactions (devices and interface automation, instrumentation evaluation, interactive systems, benchmarking driver performance, and behaviour), or techniques that span devices distributed in time and space. 
  Breakthrough user experiences leveraging techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, speech processing, networking, or human perception and cognition. 
  Innovative software architectures, design tools, toolkits, programming systems, and development environments that support the development and use of the above technologies in user interfaces. 

 Length and Format   

 Paper Length  :  To be considered Full Papers, contributions should be more than six pages long (single column template). There is no hard page limit, but long papers without a proportional contribution are more likely to be rejected. Previous papers (if converted to the new ACM single-column format) would have run 14-18 pages in length.   
 Videos  : Videos accompanying submissions can be submitted through the India HCI EasyChair Electronic Submission Site as supplementary material (max 100 MB in size). Although papers must stand on their own, submitted videos will be available to reviewers as supporting material. Authors should note that no specific guidelines are given for developing a video. Videos are viewed only as supporting material, and authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to prepare a more polished final video presentation for inclusion in the proceedings and as supplemental material in the ACM Digital Library. Authors should note that videos too need to maintain anonymity for the review process. Authors are free to update the video once their submission is accepted, if they wish to disclose themselves in the videos.   
 When submitting your video for review, please encode your video in a format that works across as many platforms as possible without the installation of additional codecs. Please note that the total aggregate size for a submission must not exceed 100 MBytes (including all documents and additional material).   
 Reviewing process  : Each paper will be subjected to rigorous review by two Associate Chairs (from the program committee) and two external reviewers (experts in the area that are not on the committee). Contact authors will be sent the initial reviews for their papers by August 1. Authors will have an opportunity to submit a 500-word rebuttal to answer questions or clarify misunderstandings of reviewers by August 11. The final decision for accepting or rejecting a paper will be done in a PC meeting, after which the authors will be notified of the decisions.   
 All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the papers committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready draft of the paper. The primary author of each accepted paper will receive detailed instructions on how to submit a final, publication-ready version of the paper. The paper will not be formally accepted to India HCI until authors revise it and submit a final draft for approval by the programme committee. Some submissions may be asked to undergo a more intense shepherding process in order to bring them to the standard required for India HCI. The deadline for submitting the “camera ready” version after all changes will be September 10. Additionally, at least one author of each paper needs to register for the conference by this date.   
 Paper Format:  All authors should submit manuscripts in the ACM Paper Format using Microsoft Word Template, LaTeX Template, or Overleaf. [Please note that the Microsoft Word Template contains invisible meta-tags related to the paper format and structure. While writing the paper authors are requested to add their content without altering any format and structure of the template.]

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) seeks papers on the topic of measurement-based research in data communications. The focus of IMC 2025 will be on research that improves the practice of network measurement, illuminates some facet of an operational network, or both. Please see the Call for Papers   for a list of topics of particular relevance.  
 To submit a paper to the IMC 2025 conference, please read the rest of this document regarding paper formatting, registration, ethics, anonymity, and other important issues relevant to your submission.  
 For the Replicability track, an earlier Expression of Interest (EoI) is necessary (see the Call for Papers   ). The submission deadline for the EoI will be announced later, since there will be only one full paper deadline for the replicability track and it will be the one on May 15th, 2025.  
 For full papers use the paper submission site   to:  
 Register your abstract by | Thursday November 14, 2024 at 11:59PM AoE (UTC-12) | . 
  Submit your paper by | Thursday November 21, 2024 at 11:59PM AoE (UTC-12) | . 
  The above are hard deadlines and no extensions will be given.  
 Paper Formatting  
 All submissions, including invited papers on the Replicability Track, must obey the following formatting requirements.  
 Page limits | Full papers: up to 13 pages for technical content + unlimited pages for references and appendix 
  Short papers: up to 6 pages for technical content + unlimited pages for references and appendix 
  Note that any paper with technical content greater than 6 pages in length will be reviewed as a full paper, even if it contains fewer than 13 pages. 
  The paper body must include some statement about ethical considerations in an appendix section titled | Ethics | . This could simply contain the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues”, or where relevant (for example, but not exclusively, a paper involving human subjects), the discussion may be more detailed. See the Ethics section below for additional requirements for research that involves human subjects or other ethical concerns. 
  Appendices may not be used to abuse page limits. See the section regarding appendices below. 
  Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text. Fonts used in other elements of the paper (e.g., figures) should be no smaller than 9 point. 
  Submissions that do not comply with these requirements will be rejected without review.  The ACM template   style file satisfies the formatting requirements, provided you compile your source with options that produce letter page size and  10-point  fonts. The following settings in your LaTeX source should achieve that (but please verify the output):  
 \documentclass[10pt,sigconf,letterpaper,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Note that the above example includes an option ( nonacm  ) that removes the copyright block; this should only be removed for submissions. Camera-ready formats may change.  
 As an example, we also provide a sample template for ACM conference proceedings   , which you can make use of.  
 After the submission deadline, we will use the HotCRP format checking tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations.  
 Please make sure that your submitted paper satisfies the following:  
 You must list the submission number and the number of pages (ideally) in your paper in the author block, e.g., “Paper #N, 13 pages body, 15 pages total”, beneath your title. Registering your title, abstract, etc., will provide a paper submission number. Per the anonymity guidelines, you must remove any author names. 
  You must provide an abstract, and it should be of no more than 200 words. 
  You must number the pages. 
  You must submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format) and ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Other formats, including Postscript, will not be accepted. Avoid using non-standard fonts. The PC must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts that are embedded in the PDF file. 
  You should ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc. 
  You should limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB. 
  ACM provides guidelines and tools to support publishing in colors | https://authors.acm.org/journals/accessibility-recommendations-for-publishing-in-color | . Ideally, you should ensure that the paper prints well on black-and-white printers and e-paper (not color printers) and is legible to those with color blindness. Pay particular attention to figures and graphs in the paper to ensure that they are legible without color. Explicitly using grayscale colors will provide best control over how graphs and figures will be displayed in black-and-white. 
  You should ensure to avoid charged terminology. You will find suggestions for alternative terms at | https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter | . 
  Appendices  
 Although there is no page-limit to the appendices, they may not be used to abuse page limits. The page-limited body of the paper should be self-contained. Apart from the Ethics section, reviewers are not required to read any  of the appendices—and in fact will be discouraged from reading them except for relatively minor clarifying points. Papers will be evaluated based on what is in the main body of the paper.  
 A good rule of thumb is to think of the appendix as slightly more than a preemptive rebuttal: it should clarify details that, while not major enough to merit inclusion in the main body of the paper, may help clarify. Unlike a rebuttal, appendices can contain experiments and data that are not in the main body of the paper, but cannot count towards the paper’s main contributions.  
 Examples of appropriate use of appendices includes:  
 Including statistically significant ML features in the main body of the paper and insignificant features in the appendix. (This ensures that the main result is in the main body, while using the appendix to preemptively address reviewer questions like “Did you consider…?”) 
  Specific experimentation configuration parameters that, while not immediately critical to understanding the paper, would help clarify details. For instance, the full script of a user interview or survey. 
  Detailed description of the artifacts accompanying the paper. 
  Examples of inappropriate  use of appendices includes:  
 Plots that provide the primary supporting evidence of the paper’s contributions. 
  Full explanations of experiment methodology, with only a pointer to them in the main body of the paper. 
  Authorship and Conflicts  
 As part of the paper registration, authors will be required to provide paper metadata which includes title and abstract, author names, affiliations, contact email addresses, topics matching the subject matter of the paper, track (main or replicability), and conflicts with program committee (PC) members.  
 Broadly, we define conflict of interest with a PC member using the following principles:  
 You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the last 12 months, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. 
  You have a professional partnership as follows: | Past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee. 
  Collaboration on a project, publication, or grant proposal within the past 2 years (i.e., 2022 or later). 
  The PC chairs and members will review conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts where necessary and sanity checking cases where conflicts do not appear justified. If there is no basis for PC conflicts provided by authors, those conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict to avoid individual reviewers may lead to your paper being rejected. If you have concerns, please contact the PC chairs.  
 As an ACM conference, all authors are required to adhere to ACM’s policy on authorship. For definitions and clarifications, please see ACM Policy on Authorship   .  
 Anonymity Guidelines  
 IMC will use double blind submissions, per the following guidelines:  
 Author names and affiliations must not appear on any submission. 
  Identifying information such as grant numbers must not be included on submissions. 
  The text of the submission must refer to the authors’ own previous work in the third person. 
  In addition to submitting an anonymized paper, double-blind reviewing requires that both authors and reviewers take care while reviewing is happening.  
 Authors are welcome to release their paper in a non-peer-reviewed location (such as a technical report by your institution or arXiv), but you should not broadcast information about the publication widely. For example, do not post it to large mailing lists or social media forums where PC members would easily encounter it, and do not do general press releases. Authors are also welcome to talk about their work (as work-in-progress) at local institutions. In either case, authors should be aware of PC members who might encounter the work and avoid sharing the work in a way that a PC member would encounter it. Authors who are unsure of whether they are allowed to publicize their double-blind submissions should contact the program committee co-chairs at | imc2025pcchairs@acm.org | . 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double-blind reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  IMC recognizes that measurement research sometimes leverages unique capabilities that are publicly known, but not available for general use (e.g., measurement platforms, unique vantage points, tools, datasets, etc.). Revealing access to these capabilities or knowledge of them which could be interpreted as only being possible for their originators/authors, will de-facto de-anonymize a submission. However, attempts to anonymize these capabilities will not allow authors to leverage previous work on developing sound measurement capabilities, leaves reviewers without a full understanding of the new work, and may also be essentially impossible in some cases. IMC recognizes an exception for authors referring to such capabilities—even though this may de-anonymize submissions. The PC will not penalize submissions for these breaches of anonymization. We make several important comments on this exception:  
 While this exception will be important in some cases, most submissions can be effectively anonymized and therefore invoking this exception is expected to be relatively rare. 
  This exception only applies to text that discusses capabilities that cannot be blinded without significantly degrading the submission. The submission is expected to otherwise be anonymized per the general guidelines. Frivolous use of this exception to de-anonymize submissions due to laziness or in an attempt to curry favor may be held against a submission. 
  The expectation is that this exception will mostly be invoked for existing lines of research whereby authors are leveraging some well-known, but non-public facility. In most cases, first time use of a tool, vantage point, dataset, etc. will not be known to the community and, hence, can be reasonably well anonymized. 
  Illustrative examples of anonymity policy   
 Even though a specific vantage point is unique—e.g., monitoring the border of a specific University—that specificity is often not important to the submission and using a generic label like “a medium size European University” will suffice. 
  A unique vantage point—e.g., a large network telescope—need not be named, per se. However, authors should not elide important details about the vantage point in the name of strict anonymization. For instance, while the organization running a network telescope need not be given, authors are free to convey the size and scope of the telescope—even if these details give a strong indication of the authors’ organization. 
  Consider a measurement app for measuring mobile phones whereby neither the source code nor the collected data have been publicly released. A first submission on the app and data can be readily anonymized. Subsequent IMC submissions that leverage data from the app or which extend the app may name the app in order to leverage the previous work—even if these details give a strong indication of author identity. 
  A public dataset—e.g., RouteViews—can and should be named. Since the dataset is public anyone can utilize the data and therefore this has no bearing on the anonymity of the submission. 
  A public or a widely accessible measurement platform—e.g., RIPE Atlas—can and should be named. Since the platform is widely available, naming the platform has no bearing on the anonymity of the submission. 
  While the program committee will allow for breaches of anonymization to name unique capabilities where important, authors are encouraged to be judicious in their use of this exception. Specific questions should be forwarded to the program committee chairs.  
 Further information on anonymity policy   
  The IMC Steering Committee has also released a statement on double-blind review  .  
 Ethics  
 The program committee may raise concerns around the ethics of the work, even if it does not involve human subjects. All papers must include, in a clearly marked appendix section with the heading “Ethics”, a statement about ethical issues; papers that do not include such a statement may be rejected.  This could be, if appropriate for the paper, simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues.” If the work involves human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc.), the paper should clearly discuss these issues, in the ethics section.  
 Research that entails experiments involving human subjects or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) should adhere to community norms. Any work that raises potential ethics considerations should indicate this on the submission form. The basic principles of ethical research are outlined in the Belmont Report   : (1) respect for persons (which may involve obtaining consent); (2) beneficence (a careful consideration of risks and benefits); and (3) justice (ensuring that parts of the population that bear the risks of the research also are poised to obtain some benefit from it). Authors should further consult the ACM policy on research involving human subjects   for further information on ethical principles that apply to this conference.  
 Research involving human subjects must be approved by the researchers’ respective Institutional Review Boards before the research takes place. Authors should indicate on the submission form whether the work involves human subjects. If so, the authors must indicate whether an IRB protocol has been approved for the research, or if the research has been determined exempt (either self-determination or IRB determination). We expect that any research follows the practices and procedures of the institution(s) where the work is being carried out; for example, some universities require separate approval for the use of campus data. We expect researchers to abide by these protocols.  
 We recognize that different IRBs follow different procedures for determining the status of human subject research, and approval or exempt status from a single institution may not align with community norms. To help the Ethics Committee review cases of concern, there is a need for more information about the research protocol. To this end, if the work involves human subjects, the authors must include with their submission a copy of the form that was used to determine IRB status (approved or exempt), sufficiently anonymized to preserve double-blind review.  
 If the submission describes research involving human subjects and none of the authors are at an institution with an IRB (or equivalent), the authors are nonetheless expected to follow a research protocol that adheres to ethical principles, as stated in the ACM policy on research involving human subjects   . In such cases, the authors must use the Ethics section of their appendix to explain how their research protocol satisfies the principles of ethical research.  
 Some research does not involve human subjects yet nonetheless raises questions of ethics, which may be wide-ranging and not necessarily limited to direct effects. We encourage authors to be mindful of the ethics of the research that they undertake; these considerations are often not clear-cut, but often warrant thoughtful consideration. Discussions of these issues should be placed in the “Ethics” appendix section mentioned above, or in the main body of the paper where appropriate.  
 Additionally, the program committee reserves the right to conduct additional evaluations and reviews of research ethics and reserves the right to independent judgment concerning the ethics of the conducted research.  
 Contact the program committee co-chairs at imc2025pcchairs@acm.org  if you have any questions.  
 Paper Novelty  
 Under no circumstances, except where noted below, should authors submit previously-published work, submit the same work simultaneously to multiple venues, or submit papers that plagiarize the work of other authors. Like other conferences and journals, IMC prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have engaged in them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the integrity of papers under consideration. If the PC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.  
 The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission.  
 Paper Acceptance  
 The IMC 2025 PC will notify authors of acceptance/rejection decisions by March 26, 2025. All accepted papers may be shepherded by members of the PC. Authors of accepted papers should plan to interact with their shepherds immediately after notification, and to budget sufficient time between acceptance notification and the camera-ready deadline (April 26, 2025) to coordinate with their shepherd. It is a requirement that the paper be considered acceptable to the assigned shepherd so that the updates to the paper reflect the issues raised by the PC (conflicts will be mediated by the PC chairs) before the paper is considered “accepted” to appear in the conference proceedings. In addition, the publisher of the IMC proceedings will review all accepted papers submitted for the camera-ready deadline. Authors should also budget sufficient time immediately after the camera-ready deadline to be available and responsive to any editing changes requested by the publisher.  
 After acceptance, substantive changes to paper titles require approval by the PC chairs. Only in exceptional circumstances should authors change their author list, and only with the approval of the PC chairs.  
 Authors of accepted papers will also need to sign an ACM copyright-release form. All rejected papers will be treated as permanently confidential.  
 Use of Generative AI  
 While generative AI systems—such as large language models (LLMs)—are powerful and useful tools, there remain open questions as to how and which data they use to train, raising potential concerns over integrity and confidentiality. The ACM has established a set of guidelines pertaining to how authors and reviewers can use generative AI. We summarize some of the main points below, but we refer authors to the following links. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in paper rejection.  
 By authors  : The ACM’s author guidelines  state that authors are allowed to use generative AI in limited ways, and that their use must be acknowledged in the paper. For small portions of text (phrases or sentences), papers must include a footnote stating that it was generated by AI; for larger portions of text, graphics, and other content, authors must disclose in the Appendix what content was generated by an AI, along with the specific tools and versions used. Please refer to the ACM guidelines for more specific instructions.  
 By reviewers:  Reviewers are not allowed to upload any portion of the submitted papers to generative AI tools. However, according to the ACM’s peer review guidelines  , reviewers may upload the content of their own reviews to generative AI “with the sole purpose of improving the quality and readability of reviewer reports for the author, provided any and all parts of the review that would potentially identify the submission, author identities, reviewer identity, or other confidential content is removed prior to uploading into third party tools.”  
 If you have any questions pertaining to the use of generative AI by either authors or reviewers, please write to the IMC 2025 PC chairs imc2025pcchairs@acm.org

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Call for Hosting India HCI 2025  

 India HCI is an annual conference that provides a platform for designers, design academicians, students, industry and start-up partners, and other HCI-based design enthusiasts to meet and discuss their interests. In the past, it has always been organised in cooperation with the ACM SIGCHI. The conference attracts an interdisciplinary audience from both design and engineering disciplines. It offers a variety of submission tracks, such as Papers, Student Research Consortium, Student Design Consortium, Industry Presentations, and Posters & Demos, as well as Workshops, Courses, and Out of India track catering for attendees from both academics and industry. This multi-track format of the India HCI conference includes talks, presentations, panel discussions, exhibitions, and demos. The conference is typically held between October and December, taking three full days.  
   
 The India HCI Steering Committee is accepting proposals for hosting and organising the India HCI conference in 2025. Please submit the proposal via email at  shri@iitg.ac.in  and the deadline for proposal submission is  30th June 2024.  The India HCI Steering Committee will make the final decision in   July 2024.  The selected host for the conference will be publicly announced during the closing ceremony of the India HCI conference 2024. Additionally, thank-you and reminder emails to all the participants of the India HCI conference 2024 and all the members of HCIPAI will also include the announcement.  

 Proposal Outline   
   
 The proposal for hosting and organising the India HCI conference in 2025 should primarily address the following three key aspects.  
 First, briefly explain the proposers’ motivation for hosting and organising the next India HCI conference in 2025. 
  Secondly, briefly describe who the proposers are, including affiliations and relevant experience and expertise. This should include a short bio of the general co-chairs from the organising institution or institutions (if a joint proposal of two institutions, one institution as host organiser and another institution as a co-organizer) committed to working with the India HCI Steering Committee in organising the conference. While we encourage proposers to approach people who have taken on one or more of these roles in the past, we also encourage them to bring in a good balance of new people. We suggest that proposers approach former and current general chairs of India HCI conferences if they have any specific questions to make the proposal stronger. 
  Finally, the proposal should detail the proposers’ preparation for hosting the conference and how they plan to make it a success that promotes equality, diversity and accessibility. This should include the following points in addition to any other relevant details: 
  The theme of the India HCI conference 2025. Why the given theme, and how it makes this proposal stronger? 
  Proposed venue and its advantages. 
  Multiple sets of potential conference dates (preferably between mid-October to December) when the host institute has committed to supporting the conference. 
  How the proposers plan to manage the conference, starting from the formation of the organising committee, finalising relevant information (including deadlines) for the call for papers and conference registration, finalising details for the conference website, and inviting keynote speakers. This should also include an overview of the tentative budget distribution and potential sponsors. 
  Most importantly, the host institute’s ability to manage the logistics and administration to accommodate three days of the multi-track conference. The logistics primarily include the availability of at least one main conference hall to accommodate all attendees (200+) and up to 4 seminar halls for parallel sessions with audio-visual facilities and a WiFi network to support remote participation. Space and facilities to support gatherings for exhibitions, coffee breaks, lunch, and banquets. Guest house, hotels (or similar facilities nearby) for national and international delegates. Residential facility for student volunteers. This may also include references to previous experiences of organising similar events as the host institution. 
  While the organisers will have a lot of freedom to organise the conference, the India HCI Steering Committee will help the organisers with key tasks such as creating the budget, finalising the papers chairs and keynote speakers and tracking the conference timeline. The proposers must commit to working with the India HCI Steering Committee and being transparent in their presentation of their organisation of the conference to the Committee. The proposers must commit to reporting to the India HCI Steering Committee and participate in the India HCI Steering Committee meetings regularly. The India HCI Steering Committee meets at least once a month and, at times, more often, depending on the need. Currently, most meetings are virtual, though, in the past, we have organised in-person meetings when opportunities arise. 

 To promote the development of professionals, researchers and students of all disciplines related to human-computer interaction

 Call for Hosting India HCI 2025  

 India HCI is an annual conference that provides a platform for designers, design academicians, students, industry and start-up partners, and other HCI-based design enthusiasts to meet and discuss their interests. In the past, it has always been organised in cooperation with the ACM SIGCHI. The conference attracts an interdisciplinary audience from both design and engineering disciplines. It offers a variety of submission tracks, such as Papers, Student Research Consortium, Student Design Consortium, Industry Presentations, and Posters & Demos, as well as Workshops, Courses, and Out of India track catering for attendees from both academics and industry. This multi-track format of the India HCI conference includes talks, presentations, panel discussions, exhibitions, and demos. The conference is typically held between October and December, taking three full days.  
   
 The India HCI Steering Committee is accepting proposals for hosting and organising the India HCI conference in 2025. Please submit the proposal via email at  shri@iitg.ac.in  and the deadline for proposal submission is  30th June 2024.  The India HCI Steering Committee will make the final decision in   July 2024.  The selected host for the conference will be publicly announced during the closing ceremony of the India HCI conference 2024. Additionally, thank-you and reminder emails to all the participants of the India HCI conference 2024 and all the members of HCIPAI will also include the announcement.  

 Proposal Outline   
   
 The proposal for hosting and organising the India HCI conference in 2025 should primarily address the following three key aspects.  
 First, briefly explain the proposers’ motivation for hosting and organising the next India HCI conference in 2025. 
  Secondly, briefly describe who the proposers are, including affiliations and relevant experience and expertise. This should include a short bio of the general co-chairs from the organising institution or institutions (if a joint proposal of two institutions, one institution as host organiser and another institution as a co-organizer) committed to working with the India HCI Steering Committee in organising the conference. While we encourage proposers to approach people who have taken on one or more of these roles in the past, we also encourage them to bring in a good balance of new people. We suggest that proposers approach former and current general chairs of India HCI conferences if they have any specific questions to make the proposal stronger. 
  Finally, the proposal should detail the proposers’ preparation for hosting the conference and how they plan to make it a success that promotes equality, diversity and accessibility. This should include the following points in addition to any other relevant details: 
  The theme of the India HCI conference 2025. Why the given theme, and how it makes this proposal stronger? 
  Proposed venue and its advantages. 
  Multiple sets of potential conference dates (preferably between mid-October to December) when the host institute has committed to supporting the conference. 
  How the proposers plan to manage the conference, starting from the formation of the organising committee, finalising relevant information (including deadlines) for the call for papers and conference registration, finalising details for the conference website, and inviting keynote speakers. This should also include an overview of the tentative budget distribution and potential sponsors. 
  Most importantly, the host institute’s ability to manage the logistics and administration to accommodate three days of the multi-track conference. The logistics primarily include the availability of at least one main conference hall to accommodate all attendees (200+) and up to 4 seminar halls for parallel sessions with audio-visual facilities and a WiFi network to support remote participation. Space and facilities to support gatherings for exhibitions, coffee breaks, lunch, and banquets. Guest house, hotels (or similar facilities nearby) for national and international delegates. Residential facility for student volunteers. This may also include references to previous experiences of organising similar events as the host institution. 
  While the organisers will have a lot of freedom to organise the conference, the India HCI Steering Committee will help the organisers with key tasks such as creating the budget, finalising the papers chairs and keynote speakers and tracking the conference timeline. The proposers must commit to working with the India HCI Steering Committee and being transparent in their presentation of their organisation of the conference to the Committee. The proposers must commit to reporting to the India HCI Steering Committee and participate in the India HCI Steering Committee meetings regularly. The India HCI Steering Committee meets at least once a month and, at times, more often, depending on the need. Currently, most meetings are virtual, though, in the past, we have organised in-person meetings when opportunities arise. 

 To promote the development of professionals, researchers and students of all disciplines related to human-computer interaction

Information about submissions may be shared with programme chairs of other conferences for the purpose of detecting duplication.  
 Submissions must be processed in LaTeX2e and must use the Springer LNCS format with default margins and font. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Each submission must begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of key words, followed by a main body, appendices (if any), and references. The main body should begin with an introduction that summarizes the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. The length of the paper, including appendices (if any) and excluding references should not exceed 20 pages when formatted using the LNCS style. If the authors include appendices, they should be placed after the main body and before the references.  
 Optionally, additional supporting material can be appended to the submission. The additional supporting material should be placed after the references, it should be well-marked, and it has no prescribed form or page limit. Alternatively, the supporting material can be submitted as a separate file. Authors are encouraged to use this space to include proofs, source code, and other information allowing verification of results; unverifiable papers risk rejection. However, committee members will read the additional supporting material at their discretion, so the submission should be intelligible and self-contained without it. Submissions not meeting these requirements risk rejection without consideration of their mertis.  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The final versions of the accepted papers will have a page limit of 20 pages (including appendices (if any) and excluding references). Thus, the submitted paper should represent what the authors expect to finally publish. All accepted papers must conform to the Springer publishing requirements, and authors will be required to sign the Springer’s LNCS Copyright form when submitting the proceedings version of their paper. By submitting a paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one of the authors will present the paper at the conference.

  Abstract  
 Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), known for its ability to process encrypted data without decryption, is a promising technique for solving privacy concerns in the machine learning era. However, there are many kinds of available FHE schemes and way more FHE-based solutions in the literature, and they are still fast evolving, making it difficult to get a complete view. This article aims to introduce recent representative results of FHE-based privacy-preserving machine learning, helping users understand the pros and cons of different kinds of solutions, and choose an appropriate approach for their needs.

  1. Introduction  
 Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a technology that allows data manipulation in the encrypted domain without decryption. The idea of FHE was first introduced by Rivest et al.  [  1  ] in 1978, but it was not until 2008 that the first FHE scheme [  2  ] was proposed by Gentry. FHE was considered just theoretic and impractical in its early ages, but today many different FHE schemes [  3  –  7  ] have been proposed, with their efficiency greatly improved.  
 One of the promising applications of FHE is that it could enable privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) training or inference on encrypted data, protecting data confidentiality and privacy. There already exist many research works that use FHE to build PPML solutions, some of them even come close to the level of industrial deployments. Given different types of FHE schemes and machine learning tasks, the number of possible combinations is vast, and the area is still fast evolving, thus it’s often difficult to answer the question below without enough investigation:  
 Q: Suppose I want to do privacy-preserving machine learning training/inference of model X on data Y using FHE. Are there any candidate methods for my use case? If yes, which one should I choose? What level of efficiency should I expect?   
 This article tries to help users answer the question by providing a brief view of the recent research progresses of FHE-based PPML, help them choose research works to follow up, or decide whether the works are mature enough for their needs.  
 According to a talk by Gentry [  8  ], existing FHE schemes could be divided into four generations as follows:  
  
 (1) | The first generation FHE refers to Gentry’s original design [ 2  ] based on ideal lattices, and some other early FHE schemes based on integers such as DGHV [  9  ]. They are too slow to support PPML applications. 
  (2) | The second generation FHE mainly refers to the schemes based on Ring learning-with-errors (RLWE) problem such as BFV [  5  ] and BGV [ 3  ]. They can support SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) packing [  10  ], and are already efficient enough for many applications. 
  (3) | The third-generation FHE refers to DM [  4  ] and CGGI [  6  ] features slower noise growth and much faster bootstrapping compared to the second-generation ones. However, they are hard to support SIMD. 
  (4) | The fourth generation FHE is the approximate homomorphic encryption scheme CKKS [ 7  ]. It works similarly to second-generation FHEs such as BFV in many aspects, except that it targets approximate arithmetic operations instead of accurate ones, allowing much more efficient homomorphic operations. 
   
 We will follow the above classifications, and introduce the applications respectively 1   . A brief overview picture is given in Figure 1  . Note that we do not pursue a complete list of related works due to space limits, but (possibly subjectively) pick representative works that reflect the improvement of concrete efficiencies.

  2. Second-generation FHE applications  
 CryptoNets  . Microsoft Research’s CryptoNets [  16  ] is one of the first works that demonstrated the capability of homomorphic encryption (HE) in the applications of privacy-preserving neural networks. The authors employed the YASHE [  17  ] scheme to encrypt the clients’ input images in a pixel-by-pixel way and applied a 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model on top of the encrypted pixels for inference. For the ReLU activation function which is hard to compute in FHE, they replace it with a simpler squaring function. As a result, the full CNN inference just uses a few multiplication depths and does not require any bootstrapping. The cost is that they require the plaintext model to be trained using the same square activation function.  
 CryptoNets introduced two innovative optimizations (which, though common in modern FHE applications, were remarkable in 2016): (1) They encoded a plaintext into multiple ciphertexts using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), enabling support for a 5× larger plaintext space. (2) They employed the SIMD Packing mechanism [ 10  ] encrypts pixels of multiple images into one ciphertext, increasing the system’s throughput. As a result, CryptoNets was able to process 4096 encrypted MNIST images within 200 seconds, attaining an accuracy of 99%.  
 Lola  . Lola [  18  ] is a follow-up of CryptoNets. Different from CryptoNets which use one ciphertext for each pixel, Lola designs several kinds of message representations in the ciphertext and chooses the best fit representations for each layer of the network. As a result, they are more than 90× faster than CryptoNets and can support larger datasets such as Cifar-10. Note that Lola still requires the square activation function.  
 NN training  . Training neural networks on homomorphically encrypted data poses a significantly greater challenge compared to inference. Nandakumar et al.  [  19  ] made the initial attempt in this direction: They employed the BGV scheme to encrypt the input images in a bitwise way and packed the same dimension of data from multiple images within a single ciphertext, enabling parallel training on multiple images. The model utilized the Sigmoid activation function and approximated the classification loss using a quadratic function. Notably, they implemented non-linear operations using lookup tables, as lookup tables are more suitable for bitwise-encrypted inputs. However, training a simple three-layer model on a minibatch of 60 images still requires 1.5 days, which is not quite practical.  
  3. Third-generation FHE applications  
 Most of the second-generation FHE applications were restricted in the number of homomorphic multiplication depths because they had to avoid the expensive bootstrapping procedure. In contrast, the third-generation FHE schemes such as CGGI [ 6  ] are characterized by their ability to fast bootstrapping, and researchers have begun to consider designing privacy-preserving machine learning solutions based on CGGI.  
  3.1. Early works using CGGI  
 FHE-DiNN  . FHE-DiNN [  20  ] is one of such pioneering works. It introduces Discretized Neural Networks (DiNNs), where both inputs and parameters are represented as integers within a small fixed range so that the computations are friendly for CGGI. FHE-DiNN also optimizes the BlindRotate step of CGGI so that the computational complexity is halved at the cost of extra key size. Leveraging these enhancements, FHE-DiNN could perform homomorphic inference at the rate of one MNIST image per second. The limitation is that they only tested on small single-hidden-layer models containing 30 to 100 neurons.  
 TAPAS  . TAPAS [  21  ], introduced shortly after FHE-DiNN, also employs CGGI for model prediction. TAPAS targets Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), where inputs and weights are binary values. Compared to FHE-DiNN, TAPAS made experiments on larger models such as 5-layer CNNs, enabling higher accuracy. However, they may require hours to complete a single inference.  
 SHE  . SHE [  22  ] also conducted research on secure inference using CGGI. They encrypt the inputs in a bit-wise way and use CGGI to implement homomorphic boolean gates to construct ReLU and max pooling. For the convolution layer which is unfriendly for boolean operations, they quantize the weights into power-of-2 representations, so that the multiplications could be replaced by cheap bit shifts. According to the results in [ 22  ], their inference latency is 3 − 5× higher than Lola [ 18  ], but they can achieve better accuracy because of the lossless ReLU activation.  
  3.2. Works using PBS  
 The bootstrapping procedure of the CGGI scheme not only reduces the ciphertext noise but also allows the evaluation of a look-up table function at the same time, this is known as Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS). Chillotti et al.  [  23  ] and Frery et al.  [  24  ] are two notable works by the Zama team, utilizing the strength of PBS to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning inference.  
 Neural Network inference  . Chillotti et al.  [ 23  ] focuses on privacy-preserving neural network inferences. Unlike [ 20  , 21  ], this work does not require specific kinds of neural network models, instead, it’s able to perform inference on pre-trained models. For efficiency reasons, they first quantize the model parameters to a short (≤8) bit length. Then the homomorphic evaluation of the ReLU activation function could be performed via several PBSs. Frery et al.  [ 23  ] demonstrated its ability of homomorphic inference on 20-, 50-, and 100-layer neural networks on the MNIST dataset. Experimental results showed that even the 100-layer model could be completed in tens of seconds on an AWS2 cloud server. Very recently, Zama announced an optimization [  25  ] that uses approximated rounding to further reduce the number of required PBS in ReLU, making the inference procedure more than ten times faster than the original [ 23  ]. The downside is that their accuracy on MNIST is more than two percent lower than the plaintext model.  
 Tree-based model inference  . Chillotti et al.  [ 24  ] targets tree-based machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosting trees. It investigates how to transform tree-based models into operations compatible with homomorphic encryption. Similar to previous work, they quantize the model parameters to a few (≤8) bits, and convert conditional operations into functions that output 0/1 values, allowing for evaluation using PBS. According to the authors’ experiments, the inference time for a tree with depth 5 is typically within 5 seconds, and some instances even achieve sub-second performance. In terms of accuracy, the homomorphic model predictions closely match the plaintext accuracy.  
  4. Fourth-generation FHE applications  
 The CKKS [ 7  ] FHE scheme could also benefit from the SIMD properties like the second-generation FHEs but with a much higher efficiency. CKKS’s drawback is that it can only provide approximated results, but the machine learning procedure is often insensitive to small errors. As a result, CKKS quickly marked a significant leap forward in the performance of PPML applications.  
  4.1. Highlights of CKKS in iDASH competitions  
 The famous iDASH secure genome analysis competition [  26  ] has become a place where the world’s best cryptography researchers and engineers showcase the efficiency of their PPML solutions. In the homomorphic encryption track of iDASH2017, a challenge was announced to train a logistic regression model upon encrypted data. Among the participants, Kim et al.  [  27  ] achieved remarkable results using the CKKS scheme. They used 5−7 degree polynomials to approximate the Sigmoid function, and finished training on a gene dataset with 1579 samples and 18 features in just 6 minutes, attaining the expected accuracy and claiming first place. In contrast, BFV/BGV-based approaches might take tens or even hundreds of minutes to achieve similar goals.  
 In the next year, the task of iDASH2018’s homomorphic encryption track is calculating p  -values on encrypted SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). This essentially demanded training multiple models simultaneously. The two winners [  28  ] and [  29  ] both used the CKKS scheme. This highlights CKKS’s immense performance advantage in privacy-preserving machine learning applications.  
  4.2. More complicated tasks using CKKS  
 Because of its approximated nature, CKKS allows much more efficient bootstrapping techniques compared to BFV/BGV. Thus it’s possible to use CKKS to tackle more challenging privacy-preserving machine-learning tasks that require bootstrapping.  
 Logistic Regression training  . Han et al.  [  30  ] successfully trained a logistic regression model using CKKS on 422 108 samples, each with 200 features. They approximate the Sigmoid function using 3-degree Taylor polynomials and carefully design the packing of training data so that the bootstrapping procedure can be run in parallel. It took them 1060 minutes to train for 200 iterations.  
 ResNet Inference  . Lee et al.  [  31  ] successfully performed inference on CKKS encrypted data using models up to the scale of ResNet110. They designed more compact SIMD packing methods that are tailored for image data and employed high-degree (more than 20) polynomials to provide a precise approximation for the ReLU activation. New techniques are also introduced to reduce bootstrapping errors. Their ResNet-110 inference took approximately 13 000 seconds (with 75% of the time spent on bootstrapping) on an image from the Cifar-10 dataset and achieved an accuracy comparable to the plaintext inference.  
 Transformer Inference  . Recently NEXUS [  32  ] is even able to perform CKKS inference for transformer models. They designed several novel primitives to tackle the difficult parts of transformers, including attention, softmax, layernorm, and argmax. The running time of NEXUS on a Bert-base model for 128 input tokens is 1103 seconds.  
  5. Mixed-mode FHE applications  
 As has been shown above, each FHE scheme has its strengths and limitations. Second and fourth-generation FHEs could support large-scale machine learning applications, but they are expensive to handle non-polynomial operations such as ReLU. On the other hand, third-generation FHEs offer flexibility in non-polynomial computations but struggle with efficient homomorphic addition and multiplication.  
 Chimera [  33  ] is the first framework that combines different kinds of homomorphic encryptions. It proposed new intermediate formats to facilitate switching between CGGI, CKKS, and BFV ciphertexts.  
 Pegasus [  34  ] follows the blueprint of Chimera but significantly improves the performance. Instead of employing intermediate formats like Chimera, Pegasus designed direct conversions between CKKS and FHEW formats. It also utilized PBS to compute non-polynomial functions on large-domain LWE ciphertexts. Pegasus could compute arbitrary functions including division, sigmoid, or comparison in just one or two seconds. The limitation is that they are efficient only if the PBS accuracy is below 8-bits. Pegasus made multiple experiments including K-means and decision trees, demonstrated the ability to support such tasks on small datasets (with thousands of samples) in several minutes.  
 HE 3  DB [  35  ] further showcases the application of mixed-mode FHE. Although HE 3  DB focuses on database applications rather than machine learning, their idea is also leveraging Pegasus-like methods to solve both polynomial and non-polynomial problems. The difference is that they use repeated PBS to increase the accuracy of comparisons and optimize the noise growth in scheme transferring.  
  6. Hardware accelarations  
 Since FHE is computation-intensive, a popular topic is leveraging hardware such as GPU [  36  ,  37  ] or FPGA [  38  –  40  ] to accelerate FHE computations.  
 Park et al.  [  41  ] developed a GPU library supporting RNS-CKKS. With an NVIDIA A100 GPU, they can finish ResNet-20 inference on a Cifar-10 image in 8.5 seconds, which is more than 267× faster than the CPU version [ 31  ]. They also considered adopting several algorithm optimizations such as replacing ReLU activations with low-degree (2−3) polynomials by searching the neural network architecture. By combining this optimization, they can further bring down the inference time to 1.4 seconds.  
 FAB [  42  ] is an FPGA-based accelerator for CKKS. By using an Xilinx Vivado FPGA operating at 300 MHz frequency, they can train a logistic regression model on 11 982 samples with 196 features in only 0.1 seconds. This is 370× faster than the baseline run under CPU.  
 There also exist several application-specific integrated circuit(ASIC) designs for FHE acceleration, claiming speed boosting from several thousands to tens of thousand times compared to CPU, but they were mostly evaluated on simulators rather than real chips. We refer to the survey by Zhang et al.  [  43  ] for more details.  
  7. Conclusion  
 The efficiency of FHE has been greatly improved compared to the days when FHE was first invented. Today it is already practical to use FHE for PPML on small or moderate tasks. Each “generation” of FHE schemes has its own pros and cons for different kinds of application scenarios, and could not replace each other. However, there is still a long way to go before FHE can efficiently support more complex tasks such as Imagenet classification. Hardware-software co-optimization would be the key point in improving the efficiency of FHE applications in the future.

   1  Note that there are many PPML solutions based on MPC [ 11  – 14  ], the difference is that they use interactive protocols between client and server, while FHE is a fully noninteractive procedure run on the server side. This article focuses on the advances in the FHE area and refers to [ 15  ] for a survey of PPML works based on MPC.

 Instructions For Authors   
 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop. Information about submissions may be shared with programme chairs of other conferences for the purpose of detecting duplication.  
 Submissions must be processed in LaTeX2e and must use the Springer LNCS format with default margins and font. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Each submission must begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of key words, followed by a main body, appendices (if any), and references. The main body should begin with an introduction that summarizes the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. The length of the paper, including appendices (if any) and excluding references should not exceed 20 pages when formatted using the LNCS style. If the authors include appendices, they should be placed after the main body and before the references.  
 Optionally, additional supporting material can be appended to the submission. The additional supporting material should be placed after the references, it should be well-marked, and it has no prescribed form or page limit. Alternatively, the supporting material can be submitted as a separate file. Authors are encouraged to use this space to include proofs, source code, and other information allowing verification of results; unverifiable papers risk rejection. However, committee members will read the additional supporting material at their discretion, so the submission should be intelligible and self-contained without it. Submissions not meeting these requirements risk rejection without consideration of their mertis.  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The final versions of the accepted papers will have a page limit of 20 pages (including appendices (if any) and excluding references). Thus, the submitted paper should represent what the authors expect to finally publish. All accepted papers must conform to the Springer publishing requirements, and authors will be required to sign the Springer’s LNCS Copyright form when submitting the proceedings version of their paper. By submitting a paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one of the authors will present the paper at the conference.

The review assignment will be based on the view assignment system described in the following paper, which analyzes the submitted manuscripts and the representative publications of TPC members and matches the submissions to TPC members’ expertise and interests.  
 B. Li and Y.T. Hou. “The new automated INFOCOM review assignment system,” IEEE Network, vol.30, no.5, pp.18-24, Sept./Oct. 2016.  
  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7579022/   
 Papers that present data that include experiments on or with humans or animals and/or presentation or analysis of personally identifiable information, including aggregated data, must have the appropriate approval from the author(s)’ institution(s). An explicit statement about the approval must be included in the paper (with appropriate anonymization in the paper submitted for review).  
 Preprints Policy  
 The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arXiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.  
 Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 Before submission, please update your CoIs in the EDAS system. A CoI occurs when a person’s objective judgment is — or is perceived by a reasonable observer — compromised by an existing relationship, affiliation, or connection to a person whose work they must evaluate.  
 The following are considered to be specific examples of relationships that produce CoIs. Individuals in such relationships should not be involved in peer review of, or making editorial decisions about, materials provided by the related parties.  
 The lifelong relationship between Ph.D. student and Ph.D. supervisor 
  Within the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next year: | Working closely together (e.g., at the same institution, company, or organization; or within the same organizational team). 
  Recipients of joint funding or significant professional collaboration. 
  Joint authorship of an archival publication. 
  Personal or family relationships that would reasonably cause others to doubt the impartiality of the review 
  Notable personal or professional conflicts (publicly known or not). 
  Submission Cap, Length, and Formatting Requirements  
 The maximum number of papers an author can submit to IEEE INFOCOM 2025 is five  . Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®. Submitted papers must be written in English, with a maximum length limit of 10 printed pages  . The main text (including figures, tables, appendices, and any material other than references) must be no more than 9 pages  . Papers that do not comply with the length limit will not be reviewed. Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found at:  
  https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8, and use the preamble: \documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{ IEEEtran }  
 Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size). Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper in Adobe PDF format.  
 The paper must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color. The submitted manuscript should be self-contained. Inclusion of additional material (e.g., a technical report containing the detailed math proof through an anonymous Dropbox or OneDrive link) is not allowed.  
 Important Dates:  
 Abstract Due: Wednesday, July 24, 2024 (11:59pm, PDT)  
  Full Paper Due: Wednesday, July 31, 2024 (11:59pm, PDT)

 The following are considered to be specific examples of relationships that produce CoIs. Individuals in such relationships should not be involved in peer review of, or making editorial decisions about, materials provided by the related parties.  
 The lifelong relationship between Ph.D. student and Ph.D. supervisor 
  Within the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next year: | Working closely together (e.g., at the same institution, company, or organization; or within the same organizational team). 
  Recipients of joint funding or significant professional collaboration. 
  Joint authorship of an archival publication. 
  Personal or family relationships that would reasonably cause others to doubt the impartiality of the review 
  Notable personal or professional conflicts (publicly known or not). 
  Submission Cap, Length, and Formatting Requirements  
 The maximum number of papers an author can submit to IEEE INFOCOM 2025 is five  . Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®. Submitted papers must be written in English, with a maximum length limit of 10 printed pages  . The main text (including figures, tables, appendices, and any material other than references) must be no more than 9 pages  . Papers that do not comply with the length limit will not be reviewed. Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found at:  
  https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html

 Submission Guidelines      
  
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Each manuscript must clearly articulate their data (e.g., key metadata, statistical properties, etc.), analytical procedures (e.g., representations, algorithm details, etc.), and evaluation set up and results (e.g., performance metrics, statistical tests, case studies, etc.). Making data, code, and processes publicly available to facilitate scientific reproducibility is not required, but is strongly encouraged.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to enable double-blind review. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. If citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 We accept three types of paper submissions on proposed tracks and related topics: long paper (maximum of 6 pages), short paper (maximum of 3 pages), and poster (1 page). The submission format is PDF that follows IEEE publication format (see the template at IEEE – Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings). Papers should be submitted through the EasyChair submission and review system. Each accepted paper must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register the conference as an IEEE member before the early registration deadline. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements.  

 Journal Special Issue

  IEEE INFOCOM incorporates a rigorous double-blind review process. The review assignment will be based on the view assignment system described in the following paper, which analyzes the submitted manuscripts and the representative publications of TPC members and matches the submissions to TPC members’ expertise and interests.  
 B. Li and Y.T. Hou. “The new automated INFOCOM review assignment system,” IEEE Network, vol.30, no.5, pp.18-24, Sept./Oct. 2016.  
  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7579022/   
 Papers that present data that include experiments on or with humans or animals and/or presentation or analysis of personally identifiable information, including aggregated data, must have the appropriate approval from the author(s)’ institution(s). An explicit statement about the approval must be included in the paper (with appropriate anonymization in the paper submitted for review).  
 Preprints Policy  
 The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arXiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.  
 Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 Before submission, please update your CoIs in the EDAS system. A CoI occurs when a person’s objective judgment is — or is perceived by a reasonable observer — compromised by an existing relationship, affiliation, or connection to a person whose work they must evaluate.  
 The following are considered to be specific examples of relationships that produce CoIs. Individuals in such relationships should not be involved in peer review of, or making editorial decisions about, materials provided by the related parties.  
 The lifelong relationship between Ph.D. student and Ph.D. supervisor 
  Within the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next year: | Working closely together (e.g., at the same institution, company, or organization; or within the same organizational team). 
  Recipients of joint funding or significant professional collaboration. 
  Joint authorship of an archival publication. 
  Personal or family relationships that would reasonably cause others to doubt the impartiality of the review 
  Notable personal or professional conflicts (publicly known or not). 
  Submission Cap, Length, and Formatting Requirements  
 The maximum number of papers an author can submit to IEEE INFOCOM 2025 is five  . Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®. Submitted papers must be written in English, with a maximum length limit of 10 printed pages  . The main text (including figures, tables, appendices, and any material other than references) must be no more than 9 pages  . Papers that do not comply with the length limit will not be reviewed. Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found at:  
  https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8, and use the preamble: \documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{ IEEEtran }  
 Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size). Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper in Adobe PDF format.  
 The paper must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color. The submitted manuscript should be self-contained. Inclusion of additional material (e.g., a technical report containing the detailed math proof through an anonymous Dropbox or OneDrive link) is not allowed.

 What You’ll Learn  
 An introduction to how to design basic information visualizations 
  What makes a good information visualization 
  How to apply a range of basic and complex information visualization techniques 
  How the eye and the brain function together to deliver imagery, and how it affects information visualization design 
  The history of the information visualization discipline 
  How to avoid the common problems of visual perception in your designs 
  How to evaluate the effectiveness of an information visualization 

  Information visualization skills are in high demand, partly thanks to the rise in big data. Tech research giant Gartner Inc. observed that digital transformation has put data at the center of every organization. With the ever-increasing amount of information being gathered and analyzed, there’s an increasing need to present data in meaningful and understandable ways.  
 In fact, even if you are not involved in big data, information visualization will be able to help in your work processes as a designer. This is because many design processes—including conducting user interviews and analyzing user flows and sales funnels—involve the collation and presentation of information. Information visualization turns raw data into meaningful patterns, which will help you find actionable insights. From designing meaningful interfaces, to processing your own UX research, information visualization is an indispensable tool in your UX design kit.  
 This course is presented by Alan Dix, a former professor at Lancaster University in the UK. A world-renowned authority in the field of human-computer interaction, Alan is the author of the university-level textbook Human-Computer Interaction  . “Information Visualization” is full of simple but practical lessons to guide your development in information visualization. We start with the basics of what information visualization is, including its history and necessity, and then walk you through the initial steps in creating your own information visualizations. While there’s plenty of theory here, we’ve got plenty of practice for you, too.

  I missed the enrollment, and now the course has closed  . What can I do?   
     
  Don't worry if you miss the course. We will re-run it shortly. We open and close enrollment to control the classroom size.  
 Why? Networking is a large part of your learning journey, so we want just the right number of people inside the courses. That’s also why we display the "XX% booked" on our course icons.  
 If it’s very important that you enroll now, please let us know by emailing us at hello@interaction-design.org   .  

  Can I take more than one course  at a time?   
     
  With a Professional membership, you can take as many courses as you’d like, at no extra cost. For example, if there are over 40 active courses, you can enroll in all of them at the same time and move from one to another freely.  
 With a Student membership, you can take a maximum of two courses at the same time. You can still take as many courses as you like—free of extra charges. You’d just have to finish (or drop them) so that you don’t have more than two ongoing courses at any one time.  
 Once you’re enrolled, you can take all the time you need to complete a given course.  

  Will I receive my Course Certificate  ?   
     
  You’ll get a digital industry-recognized course certificate at no extra cost every time you complete a course with a score of 70% or more.  
 Certificates never expire and can be saved as a .jpg file, so they’re easy to share. There’s no limit to how many certificates you can earn during your membership.  
 You can see an example of a Course Certificate at the bottom of the Course Catalogue   .  
 There’s no specified time by which certificates must be awarded. Instead, they’re given to you as and when you’ve answered all quiz questions. This applies even if the questions are answered long after the official end date of the course.  

  How long does it take to complete a course  ?  

  Course lengths vary to fit your schedule. You can squeeze in short sessions daily or dive deep in longer bursts—whatever fits your busy life.  
 The course outline provides a rough estimate of how much time you would spend learning before enrolling.  
 Once enrolled in a course, you’ll gain access to a new lesson each week. You’re free to complete the lessons without any deadlines or end dates.  
 If you need to unlock lesson content sooner, please let us know by emailing us at hello@interaction-design.org   .  

  When will my answers be marked/graded  , and how will they be graded?  

  Your answers will be graded by our experts and course instructors (not by machines) approximately two weeks after you submit your work.  
 We mark/grade in so-called "sprints." This is much more efficient than doing little batches every day. It's part of our lean/agile work philosophy and is one of the factors that keeps our membership prices so low.  

  I’m falling behind the course schedule  and new lessons are starting before I’ve completed the previous lesson(s). Will I be locked out of these unfinished lessons?  

  No, you’ll not be locked out of any lesson or course.  
 You’ll have access to all course materials throughout your membership. There’s no pressure to keep at the same pace as the lesson release dates.  
 Sticking to a schedule has its benefits. When you follow along with other members, you can reap the benefits of our online community, ask questions, and exchange ideas. This has the potential to accelerate your learning.  

  I scored less than 70%  in a course, so I didn't qualify for a certificate. Can I try again  ?  

  Yes! Everyone's learning journey looks different, and we encourage you to continue learning and improving your progress.  
 To retake a course, just follow these steps:  
 NB:  Before you start, please note that when you drop a course, you’ll lose your progress and any answers you submit. Screenshot or save answers you'd like to reuse.  
 1. Go to your profile   and click on the course you'd like to retake.  
 2. Underneath your progress bar at the top of your screen, you'll see “UX Courses” with an arrow (>) pointing to the course landing page.  
 3. Click through to the landing page and scroll to the bottom.  
 4. Tap the red button that says, “Drop my course now.”  
 5. Head back to our UX Courses   page and re-enroll yourself in the course.  
 You're all set to try again!  
 In some cases, we can open lessons for members who are retaking a course so that they don't have to wait for familiar lessons to unlock each week. If you'd like us to do this, please let us know at hello@interaction-design.org.
