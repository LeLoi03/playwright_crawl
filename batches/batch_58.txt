 Call for Papers  
 Overview  
 The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13 2025.   
 We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation. The research may target systems in a broad range of domains, including networking, high-performance computing, machine learning, IoT, cloud, edge, multimedia, mobile, and cyber-physical systems. The work may target diverse system metrics such as latency, throughput, reliability, cost, accuracy, fairness, energy, and carbon footprint.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Awards and the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).

 Papers may be submitted to any deadline and, upon acceptance, papers will be scheduled for publication in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems  (POMACS) and presentation at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft Tracking | : SIGMETRICS uses "soft" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high-performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks,cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site. 
  The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of the claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to "opt out" of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to "opt out", an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS, and submit the paper with an authors' response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Overview  
 The 2024 ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance conference will be held in Venice, Italy, on June 10-14 2024.   
 We solicit papers on the development and application of state-of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic simulation and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques. The conference provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing systems and networks. Of particular interest is work that presents new performance evaluation methods, or that creatively applies previously developed methods to make predictions about, or gain insights into, key design trade-offs in a variety of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems, ranging from mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications to large-scale cloud computing systems and the smart grid.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Award and the Stephen S. Lavenberg and Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).

The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft tracking | : SIGMETRICS / Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS / Performance 2024 (for all three deadlines) are: | Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems, computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks, and cyber-physical systems, including the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  Up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of their claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS / Performance conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. This is similar to the “Minor Revision” outcome at a journal. 
  One-shot Revision: | This is similar to the “Major Revision” outcome in a journal. In such cases, the authors will receive a list of issues that are required to be addressed before the paper can be accepted. Authors may then submit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 deadlines). The revision should include an author response to the issues raised by the reviewers as part of the appendix of the paper. In the submitted one-shot revision, authors may use one additional page (for a total of 21 pages in the main paper, plus unlimited appendices) to address the reviewers' requested changes. If the paper is not submitted within this time then any resubmission will be treated as a new paper. The outcome after resubmission of a “one-shot revision” will either be “Accept with Shepherding” or “Reject”. The one-shot revision may be rejected, for example, if the reviewers find that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed in the revision. If the revision is accepted as a poster or rejected then any future revision of it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance 2024 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2024]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2024] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. However, papers undergoing a one-shot revision are allowed to add authors between the submissions. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS / Performance submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS / Performance process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS / Performance. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to “opt out” of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to “opt out”, an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS / Performance, and submit the paper with an authors’ response to the SIGMETRICS / Performance reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS / Performance does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS / Performance submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient—in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies (i) on the roles and responsibilities in ACM publishing  , (ii) on the coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Call for Papers  
 Overview  
 The 2024 ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance conference will be held in Venice, Italy, on June 10-14 2024.   
 We solicit papers on the development and application of state-of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic simulation and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques. The conference provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing systems and networks. Of particular interest is work that presents new performance evaluation methods, or that creatively applies previously developed methods to make predictions about, or gain insights into, key design trade-offs in a variety of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems, ranging from mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications to large-scale cloud computing systems and the smart grid.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Award and the Stephen S. Lavenberg and Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).

The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft tracking | : SIGMETRICS / Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS / Performance 2024 (for all three deadlines) are: | Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems, computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks, and cyber-physical systems, including the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  Up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of their claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS / Performance conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. This is similar to the “Minor Revision” outcome at a journal. 
  One-shot Revision: | This is similar to the “Major Revision” outcome in a journal. In such cases, the authors will receive a list of issues that are required to be addressed before the paper can be accepted. Authors may then submit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 deadlines). The revision should include an author response to the issues raised by the reviewers as part of the appendix of the paper. In the submitted one-shot revision, authors may use one additional page (for a total of 21 pages in the main paper, plus unlimited appendices) to address the reviewers' requested changes. If the paper is not submitted within this time then any resubmission will be treated as a new paper. The outcome after resubmission of a “one-shot revision” will either be “Accept with Shepherding” or “Reject”. The one-shot revision may be rejected, for example, if the reviewers find that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed in the revision. If the revision is accepted as a poster or rejected then any future revision of it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize their papers.

  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance 2024 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2024]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2024] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers).

Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS / Performance process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS / Performance. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system.

 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025)  
 July 14–19, 2025  
 Washington, DC and Online  
   
 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

  PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.  
 Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):  
 Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts) 
  Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data) 
  Scripts for data processing or simulations 
  Machine-generated proofs 
  Formal specifications 
  Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts) 
   
 Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of utility, and feedback is given to the authors. Issues considered include software bugs, readability of documentation and appropriate licensing. After your artifact has been approved by the committee, we will accompany the paper link on petsymposium.org  with a link to the artifact along with an artifact badge so that interested readers can find and use your artifact.  
 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies    
  You are invited to submit nominations for the 2025 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

It is awarded at PETS and carries a cash prize as well as a physical award statue. Any paper by any author written in the area of privacy enhancing technologies is eligible for nomination. However, the paper must have appeared in a refereed journal conference, or workshop with proceedings published in the period from April 1 2023 until March 30, 2025.  
 Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award   
  A winner of the Andreas Pfitzmann PETS 2025 Best Student Paper Award will be selected at PETS 2025. Papers written solely or primarily by a student who is presenting the work to PETS 2025 are eligible for the award.  
 Artifact Award   
  A winner of the PETS 2025 Artifact Award will be announced at PETS 2025. Artifacts for papers accepted to PETS 2025 are eligible for the award.  
 HotPETs and FOCI   
  As with the last several years, part of the symposium will be devoted to HotPETs — the "hottest," most exciting research ideas still in a still in a formative state — and FOCI, a workshop showcasing the latest results from the Free and Open Communication on the Internet community. Further information will be published on the PETS website in early 2025.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 All papers must be submitted to the official PIMRC 2025 submission system  .  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE: To be published in the IEEE PIMRC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the “FULL or LIMITED” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE PIMRC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
   
  During the initial paper submission process, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on th paper registration page. In particular, the paper registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all papers must be submitted to the official PIMRC 2025 submission system  .  
 IMPORTANT:  
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.  
 You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.

 General information  
 PKC 2025 will take place in Røros, Norway on May 12-15, 2025. PKC 2025 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research  (IACR). The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.  
 Original research papers on all aspects of public-key cryptography, covering theory, implementations and applications, and related fields, are solicited for submission to PKC 2025, the The International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography. In more detail, areas of interest include research on:  
 public key schemes, such as their design and analysis (including side channel attacks), from its math to actual systems 
  the design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols 
  public-key techniques in MPC or other protocols 
  Please note that pure information-theoretic and symmetric-key subjects, e.g. block cipher design and attacks, are not in scope. This year, we particularly welcome submissions on the theme of “Real-world public-key cryptography.” These submissions must still meet the acceptance criteria for PKC above.  
 Program committee members are permitted to submit either 3 co-authored papers, or at most 4 co-authored papers all with students.  
  
 How to submit  
 Author instructions for paper submission may be found on the submission page.

  Further details are available on the paper submission page  .   

 Schedule  
 PKC 2025 will operate a two-round review system with rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions which are considered of value for proceeding to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification with review comments. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to the review comments.  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews may be submitted in other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account their rebuttal letter. They then make the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose a paper to receive an overall best paper award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at an early stage in their career, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper authored exclusively by early-career researchers. To be eligible, all co-authors must be studying full/part-time or have received their degree in 2019 or later. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the general chair.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing 
  Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.  
 The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site will be at https://pldi2025.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM on Thursday November 14, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well, e.g.:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.   
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text.  All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: 
  Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  
 Code of Conduct   
 PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy  and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior  .  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science publications have embraced double-blind reviewing. PLDI has used it for several years now and doing so is stipulated in the Practices of PLDI (under update).  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. In general, you should aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if your paper is the first to describe a system with a well-known name or codename, or you use a personally-identifiable naming convention for your work, then use a different name for your submission (which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing). You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-blind reviewing. You should do the following. First, cite the code in your paper, but remove the actual URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review” or similar. Second, if, when writing your author response, you believe reviewer access to your code would help, say so in your author response (without providing the URL), and upload a zip file containing the code under supplemental materials (but make sure that the code/documentation does not reveal the identity of the authors).  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to the present submission and is also under review. When in doubt, contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the Review Committee, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the Review Committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, PLDI paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Associate Editor. 
  Q: Will the fact that PLDI is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts-of-interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call-for-papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Associate Editor. Otherwise, you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should write their own reviews and not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers (e.g., you do not feel completely qualified), then please take the following steps: First, submit a review for your paper that is as careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be the end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper. Second, the review form provides a mechanism for suggesting additional expert reviewers to the PC Chair, who may contact them if additional expertise is needed. Please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 Q: When will author identities be revealed?   
 A: The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing. The authors of rejected papers will remain anonymous to everyone except the Associate Editor.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing 
  Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.  
 The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site will be at https://pldi2025.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM on Thursday November 14, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well, e.g.:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.   
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text.  All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: 
  Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  
 Code of Conduct   
 PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy  and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior  .  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science publications have embraced double-blind reviewing. PLDI has used it for several years now and doing so is stipulated in the Practices of PLDI (under update).  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. In general, you should aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if your paper is the first to describe a system with a well-known name or codename, or you use a personally-identifiable naming convention for your work, then use a different name for your submission (which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing). You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-blind reviewing. You should do the following. First, cite the code in your paper, but remove the actual URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review” or similar. Second, if, when writing your author response, you believe reviewer access to your code would help, say so in your author response (without providing the URL), and upload a zip file containing the code under supplemental materials (but make sure that the code/documentation does not reveal the identity of the authors).  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to the present submission and is also under review. When in doubt, contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the Review Committee, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the Review Committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, PLDI paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Associate Editor. 
  Q: Will the fact that PLDI is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts-of-interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call-for-papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Associate Editor. Otherwise, you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should write their own reviews and not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers (e.g., you do not feel completely qualified), then please take the following steps: First, submit a review for your paper that is as careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be the end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper. Second, the review form provides a mechanism for suggesting additional expert reviewers to the PC Chair, who may contact them if additional expertise is needed. Please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 Q: When will author identities be revealed?   
 A: The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing. The authors of rejected papers will remain anonymous to everyone except the Associate Editor.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing 
  Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.  
 The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site will be at https://pldi2025.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM on Thursday November 14, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well, e.g.:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.   
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text.  All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: 
  Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  
 Code of Conduct   
 PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy  and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior  .  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science publications have embraced double-blind reviewing. PLDI has used it for several years now and doing so is stipulated in the Practices of PLDI (under update).  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. In general, you should aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if your paper is the first to describe a system with a well-known name or codename, or you use a personally-identifiable naming convention for your work, then use a different name for your submission (which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing). You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-blind reviewing. You should do the following. First, cite the code in your paper, but remove the actual URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review” or similar. Second, if, when writing your author response, you believe reviewer access to your code would help, say so in your author response (without providing the URL), and upload a zip file containing the code under supplemental materials (but make sure that the code/documentation does not reveal the identity of the authors).  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to the present submission and is also under review. When in doubt, contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the Review Committee, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the Review Committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, PLDI paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Associate Editor. 
  Q: Will the fact that PLDI is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts-of-interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call-for-papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Associate Editor. Otherwise, you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should write their own reviews and not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers (e.g., you do not feel completely qualified), then please take the following steps: First, submit a review for your paper that is as careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be the end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper. Second, the review form provides a mechanism for suggesting additional expert reviewers to the PC Chair, who may contact them if additional expertise is needed. Please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 Q: When will author identities be revealed?   
 A: The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing. The authors of rejected papers will remain anonymous to everyone except the Associate Editor.

  Workshop Speaker's Guide 
  Call for Workshops and Tutorials  
  
 PLDI 2025 is a world-class forum for researchers and practitioners in programming language design and implementation. As in previous years, PLDI is soliciting proposals for co-located workshops and tutorials that will take place on Monday June 16th, and Tuesday June 17th  .  
 Please propose your workshop or tutorial via the submission system (click the “Submit proposal” link on the right sidebar).  
 The following details will be asked requested for each submission:  
 Name of the workshop/tutorial. 
  Duration of the workshop/tutorial. 
  Organizers: names, affiliation, contact information, brief (100 words) biography. 
  A short description (150-200 words) of the topic. 
  Event format: workshop/tutorial; type of submissions, if any; review process; results dissemination. 
  Expected attendance and target audience within the PLDI community. 
  How you plan to foster an inclusive environment and promote a diverse attendance. 
  Information on any previous iterations of the workshop or tutorial. 
  Timeline   
 For workshops with proceedings:   
 Organizers submit proposal to chairs: | November 14, 2024 
  Chairs respond with workshop acceptance: December 8, 2024 
  Organizers finalize acceptance decisions for workshop proceedings: no later than April 19, 2024 
  Organizers collect final (“camera ready”) versions: no later than May 3, 2024 
  For tutorials and workshops without proceedings:   
 Organizers submit proposal to chairs: | November 24, 2024 
  Chairs respond with workshop acceptance: December 8, 2024 
  Organizers finalize acceptance decisions for workshop speakers: no later than May 3rd, 2024 
  Submission and Review   
 To submit your proposal, please use the “Submit Proposal” link from the sidebar to the right.  
 Proposals are reviewed by the Workshop and Tutorials Chairs, and if necessary, by the PLDI general chair. Proposals will be evaluated according to the relevance of the topic, the expertise and experience of the workshop organizers, and their potential to attract participants. Proposals submitted between November 14th and 24th will be evaluated on a first-come-first-served basis, so please submit early!   
 Dissemination   
 A proposal should clearly state how the results of the tutorial or workshop — i.e., published papers and other outcomes — will be made available to participants and others before and after the workshop event. The Workshops and Tutorials Chairs will provide guidance to the organizers of accepted workshops that wish to publish proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. For those that choose to publish their papers in ACM Digital Library, please add the following text in the workshop call for papers and on the website:  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
  
 Workshops that elect to publish proceedings can do so in the ACM Digital Library with sponsoring by SIGPLAN. The application for SIGPLAN sponsorship includes reviewing the proposed program committee with the SIGPLAN Executive Committee, a process which the chairs will help facilitate.

 Call for Papers 
  FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing 
  Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.  
 The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site will be at https://pldi2025.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM on Thursday November 14, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well, e.g.:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.   
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text.  All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: 
  Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  
 Code of Conduct   
 PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy  and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior  .  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science publications have embraced double-blind reviewing. PLDI has used it for several years now and doing so is stipulated in the Practices of PLDI (under update).  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. In general, you should aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if your paper is the first to describe a system with a well-known name or codename, or you use a personally-identifiable naming convention for your work, then use a different name for your submission (which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing). You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-blind reviewing. You should do the following. First, cite the code in your paper, but remove the actual URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review” or similar. Second, if, when writing your author response, you believe reviewer access to your code would help, say so in your author response (without providing the URL), and upload a zip file containing the code under supplemental materials (but make sure that the code/documentation does not reveal the identity of the authors).  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to the present submission and is also under review. When in doubt, contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the Review Committee, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the Review Committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, PLDI paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Associate Editor. 
  Q: Will the fact that PLDI is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts-of-interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call-for-papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Associate Editor. Otherwise, you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should write their own reviews and not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers (e.g., you do not feel completely qualified), then please take the following steps: First, submit a review for your paper that is as careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be the end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper. Second, the review form provides a mechanism for suggesting additional expert reviewers to the PC Chair, who may contact them if additional expertise is needed. Please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 Q: When will author identities be revealed?   
 A: The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing. The authors of rejected papers will remain anonymous to everyone except the Associate Editor.

 General information PKC 2025 will take place in Røros, Norway on May 12-15, 2025. PKC 2025 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. Original contributions on all technical aspects of cryptology are solicited for submission to PKC 2025, the The International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography. Submissions are welcomed on any cryptographic topic including but not limited to: foundational theory and mathematics the design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols secure implementation and optimization in hardware or software applied aspects of cryptography Schedule PKC 2025 will operate a two-round review system with rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions which are considered of value for proceeding to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification with review comments. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to the review comments. The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews may be submitted in other conferences after the first round notification date. In the second round the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account their rebuttal letter. They then make the final decision of acceptance or rejection. Awards The Program Committee may choose a paper to receive an overall best paper award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at an early stage in their career, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper authored exclusively by early-career researchers. To be eligible, all co-authors must be studying full/part-time or have received their degree in 2019 or later. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified. Stipends Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the general chair.

 Asian Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People & Practices  

 11 th  AsianPLoP Conference  
  “AI & Patterns”  
 March 28-31, 2025  
  Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan   

 ABOUT AsianPLoP  
 The Asian Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People & Practices   
 Asian Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs (AsianPLoP) is a premier event for pattern enthusiasts to gather, discuss, and learn. Originally focused on software-related patterns and pattern languages, PLoP has expanded into all aspects of the built world—anything that is designed and made by people, including organizations, culture, and individual practice. The recent, wide-ranging developments led the Hillside Group to rename PLoP to Pattern Languages of Programs, People & Practices starting in 2024.  
 Now, we are at another juncture patterns and pattern languages can help making a difference. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly, especially with large language models (LLMs) permeating various fields. Utilizing pattern languages to describe the design of AI and LLM-based applications across different domains will be an important research direction. Therefore, the major theme of AsianPLoP 2025 will focus on AI Patterns and related issues. We hope to bring together researchers from Asia and other regions of the world come together to explore this new direction. AsianPLoP 2025 will be hosted by Tunghai University in Taiwan and co-organized by the Software Engineering Association of Taiwan (SEAT).  
 AsianPLoP 2025 welcomes paper authors and nonauthors alike! Writers Workshops offer authors feedback on their papers while Imagination Run Wild sessions offer everyone, including nonauthors, a chance to share in a variety of session formats.  
 AsianPLoP brings together practitioners and researchers whose interests span a broad range of topics, but all of whom share an interest in exploring the power of patterns. AsianPLoP invites you to add your expertise to the growing body of patterns. At AsianPLoP we focus on improving the written expression of patterns (both their form and content) through writers’ workshops. We also welcome proposals for focus group workshops. Bring it on!  
 Whether you’re a pattern novice, an expert, interested in sharing, or curious about learning, you are welcome to contribute to the AsianPLoP 2025 program with a paper and/or a focus group workshop.  
 AsianPLoP 2024  proceedings can be found here  .

 What Past AsianPLoP  
  Attendees Are Saying  

 Anja Bertels  
 My first AsianPLoP (2024) was my third PLoP and one of the best overall conference experiences I ever had. The workshops left me inspired and full of new motivation and ideas, the influence of people I met enriched the quality of my writing and discovering a whole new country was the cherry on top.     “  

 Kiyoka Hayashi  
 This was my first AsianPLoP. I was genuinely surprised to see so many researchers and practitioners in Asia utilizing patterns in such meaningful ways. It was exciting to make new connections with “friends” bonded by pattern languages!”      

 HISTORY  
 The PLoP Conferences  
 The Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices (PLoP) was established thirty years ago by The Hillside Group. It gathers people who wish to improve the quality of life through designing and using social and technical systems in a more humane way, effectively articulating professional and other creative practices, and sharing this tacit knowledge more broadly. To achieve this, the conference promotes the use of patterns and pattern languages, as well as the underlying theory of the nature of order.  
 Originating in the work of Christopher Alexander on building architecture, these ideas have been further developed in computer science, fundamentally changing the perception of software development. Much of the pioneering work in this area originated at this and other PLoP conferences throughout the world. Patterns and pattern languages have expanded to many other areas, including art, well-being, learning, psychology, organizational development and change, sociology, and anthropology. AsianPLoP started in 2010 in the spirit of PLoPs with the support of The Hillside Group  and encourages a variety of submissions regardless of the area they target.  

 MISSION  
 The Hillside Group  
 The mission of the Hillside Group is to improve the quality of life and society as a whole. This includes architects, developers, managers, owners, workers, educators, students, and more. Understanding and helping the human element is critical for achieving success. The Hillside Group believes in making processes and design more humane by paying attention to real people and existing practices.  
 The Hillside Group promotes the use of patterns and pattern languages to record, analyze, and share knowledge to help achieve its mission. The Hillside Group sponsors a variety of activities to achieve this mission—organizing workshops, hosting PLoP (pattern) conferences, and producing publications for discussing, recording, and documenting successful practices.

 PLMW@ICFP'24: Final call for Participation (travel funding application by June 21)  
 APPLICATION FOR PLMW TRAVEL FUNDING For full consideration for scholarship funding, please apply at the link below by June 21, AoE. We will notify accepted attendees in a rolling fashion until all funding is committed. The application can be accessed at the following URL (Apply by June 21, 2024 AOE for full consideration!): https://forms.gle/vC6udnMWRvvAczPR6 —-------------------------------------------------------------- ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at ICFP 24, Milan, Italy Workshop: Monday, September 2, 2024 Website: https://icfp24.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-ICFP-2024 PLMW is a workshop co-located with ICFP 2024 (the International Conference on Functional Programming) in Milan, Italy, from September 2-7. The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate students and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in programming language research. This workshop will bring together world leaders in programming languages research and teaching from academia and industry to help students imagine how they might contribute to our research community. Topics will range from the abstract (e.g., what is PL research and how does one become involved in it) to the concrete (e.g., how to navigate an academic conference, how to pick a research area) as well as technical talks on cutting-edge topics. We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students, and people with disabilities to attend PLMW. This workshop is part of the activities surrounding ICFP, and takes place the day before the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the ICFP conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that participants will stay through the entire conference. Note that ICFP and PLMW are planned to be largely in-person events. While we recognize that travel to conferences is not easy for everyone, we do hope you will be able to join us in person to get the most out of the conference and its community-building aspects. A number of sponsors have generously donated scholarship funds for qualified students to attend PLMW. These scholarships can cover expenses (airfare, hotel, and registration fees) for attendance at both the workshop and the ICFP conference. Students attending this year will get one year free student membership of SIGPLAN, unless they prefer to opt out during their application. The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative sources of funding are welcome as well.

EuroPLoP is open for synergies with other fields and therefore accepts up to 20% of pattern papers on non-computing topics. EuroPLoP accepts papers containing patterns or pattern languages, as well as  papers related to the theory and the practical application of patterns. EuroPLoP also accepts excerpts from Ph.D. theses or book projects. In the past, many book authors have submitted parts of their work to get feedback from the pattern community.  
 We particularly welcome submissions on the following topics (theory and practice):  

 Tracks  

 Software/Systems Engineering, Classical Software Design Patterns | Patterns in software and systems architecture, design, and implementation 
  Patterns in Human-computer-interface (HCI) design and architecture 
  Patterns for improving software quality and software verification 
  Reports, studies, or empirical evaluations of using patterns and pattern languages 
  Modern Development and Operations Paradigms | Patterns in agile processes, e.g., XP, Scrum, DevOps, CI/CD 
  Patterns in API Design & Management, Microservices, SOA, Serverless 
  Patterns in Domain Driven Design (DDD), Model-driven Development & Eng. 
  Patterns in Business, Organization, Innovation, and Requirements Engineering | Patterns for business, organization, requirements engineering, and process management

  *  The exact assignment of topics to writers workshops may change due to balancing reasons.  

 Paper submission deadline: February 3, 2025   

 Call for Focus Group Proposals  

 Do you have a pattern-related topic with the potential to spark a discussion? Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers. They are 1 to 2 hour sessions, usually workshops, but you are welcome to experiment with different formats. Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants.  

 Focus Group Proposal submission deadline: May 16, 2025   

 Paper Submission Process  

 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. This is an experienced pattern author, who will provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. The submission system is available under https://www.europlop.net/submission/  .  

 Paper Submission Format  

 The final submission for publication must be formatted using the two-column  ACM template  ,  but for the drafts and intermediate versions,  you can use any format. However, we encourage you to use the ACM format  right from the beginning to avoid layout problems in the end. If you don’t  intend to publish with ACM, you can choose whatever format you like. We  recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.  Longer papers are also possible but bear in mind that the writers’ workshop  might decide to focus only on a part of your paper. Have a look at the   introductory information pack  for examples.    

 EuroPLoP Values  

 High-quality feedback  
 All submissions will benefit from an iterative shepherding process prior to the conference: an experienced pattern author will give you  feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. In Writers’  Workshops – the core of the conference – peers and experts will  discuss your paper. You will receive in-depth, constructive feedback  and insights to improve your paper further. If you wish, you may  complement your paper with alternative media (e.g., short video clips  linked from the paper) to get feedback on that format as well.   
 Share and learn  
 Patterns are an effective way to share knowledge about a domain. The interdisciplinary topics of the conference will provide you with new insights and inspiring ideas from other fields.  
 Theory and practice  
 EuroPLoP, with its creative and constructive atmosphere, attracts participants from both industry and academia. You will be part of a unique community of pattern book authors, researchers, and practitioners.  

 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd.  

 On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published.  
  
 The final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer format, but you can use any format for the drafts and intermediate versions.

 ASPLOS 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 Synopsis  
 ASPLOS, the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. It focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. ASPLOS 2025 will take place in March-April 2025 in Rotterdam, co-located with EuroSys 2025.  
 ASPLOS 2025 has three submission deadlines – spring, summer and fall – which are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready. As in recent years, ASPLOS 2025 will allow the authors of some submissions to choose to apply a major revision to their submission in order to fix a well-defined list of problems.

 Scope and Expectations  
 The scope of ASPLOS 2025 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construes systems  broadly, and areas of interest include, but are not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines. Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome submission of “experience papers” that have a novel component and that clearly articulate the lessons learned. We likewise welcome submissions whereby novelty lies in furthering our understandings of existing systems, e.g., by uncovering previously unknown, valuable insights or by convincingly refuting prior published results and common wisdom. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.  
 Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:  
 Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales 
  Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators 
  Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters 
  Memory, storage, networking, and I/O 
  Power, energy, and thermal management 
  Profiling, debugging, and testing 
  Security, reliability, and availability 
  Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  A good submission will typically: motivate a significant problem; propose a practical solution or approach that makes sense; demonstrate not just the pros but also the cons of the proposal using sound experimental methods; explicitly disclose what has and has not been implemented; articulate the new contributions beyond previous work; and refrain from overclaiming, focusing the abstract and introduction sections primarily on the difference between the new proposal and what is already available. The latter statement should be interpreted broadly to also encompass studies that broaden our understanding of existing systems (rather than suggest new ones), which may constitute a significant problem in its own right. Submissions will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, and clarity. Submissions are expected to adhere to SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  and all the policies specified below.  
 Resubmissions  
 Authors of resubmitted work must describe in a separate note—to be uploaded to the submission site at submission time—the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page.  
 For resubmitted work that received a “Major Revision” followed by a revised submission, the revision also counts as a submission  , so the note should describe changes relative to the revision rather than the original submission.  
 Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next two subsequent review cycles. The corresponding restrictions on ASPLOS ‘25 submissions are thus:  
 Papers rejected in 2024 Spring, or earlier, are now eligible for resubmission to ASPLOS. 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Summer may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Summer (or later). 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Fall may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Fall (or later). 
  These resubmission rules are strict and hold even if a submission has undergone extensive revision. If a paper is withdrawn from an ASPLOS cycle after reviews are made available  , it is considered “rejected” from that cycle (and cannot be resubmitted to the next two cycles).  
 Major Revisions  
 In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2025 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification). These submissions will be provided with clear and actionable reviewer feedback for their revision, and they will be typically reviewed by some of the same reviewers as the original submission. If the revision requirements are satisfactorily met, the revised submission will be accepted.  
 Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements.  
 Accept or reject notifications for spring and summer major revisions will coincide with the notifications of the subsequent cycle. Notifications of fall major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revisions have been resubmitted.  
 Anonymization  
 ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission by avoiding identifying yourself or your institution/affiliation in any of the submitted documents (except in specific fields on the HotCRP submission form designated for this purpose), either explicitly or by implication, e.g., through references, acknowledgments, online repositories that are referenced by the submission, or interaction with committee members.  
 Do not include a “reference removed for blind review” text or similar in your submission. When it is necessary to cite your own studies, cite them as written by a third party. Only if that is not possible, they can be uploaded and cited as anonymized supplemental material (see below). This applies to workshop papers that are being extended by your current ASPLOS submission, and related submissions of your own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy, and some other exceptions apply; see the “originality and concurrent submissions” section below for details.  
 Please make sure not to reveal author and/or affiliation information through side channels and other less obvious means. For example, the metadata included in the PDF should not give away such information. If you’d like to point to a repository of, e.g., the working code of your system (which is great and much appreciated), this repository should, of course, be anonymized. It is okay and often makes sense to create anonymized repositories merely for the sake of an anonymous submission. If your system is already released to the public, rename it in your submission. You should likewise avoid inadvertently revealing affiliation in your submission by identifying your company’s name in situations where, e.g., it is clear that the authors of the submission most probably work for the company that manufactures the device or provides the service that constitutes the topic of your work; instead, please use a generic name, like “a computer server vendor X,” “a cloud service provider Y,” and such like.  
 If concealing system name or affiliation would make your paper difficult to understand, contact the program chairs to discuss exceptions to this policy. Submissions that are not properly anonymized will likely be rejected without review.  
 Anonymized Supplemental Material  
 Supplemental material may be submitted as a single-but-separate anonymized PDF file without page limit. The nature of such material is explained in the above “anonymization” section. We permit uploading such material exclusively for the purpose of handling specific anonymity issues.  
 The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material mechanism should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewers are neither required nor encouraged to read such material when making their decision.  
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected.  
 Both people and institutions (companies, universities, and other relevant organizations) may be declared as having a conflict of interest (COI) with respect to an author. Please declare a COI with the following for any author of your submission; please do so with respect to all your conflicts, not just restricted to program committee (PC) and extended review committee (ERC) members, as we may occasionally ask for external reviews from people outside the PC/ERC.  
 Your current institution(s) and other institutions that you were affiliated with in the past four years relative to the submission deadline; also, an institution that is about to become your employer. 
  Your PhD advisor(s), post-doctoral host(s), PhD students, and post-doctoral advisees; these COIs are forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage and close personal friends (who may potentially be reviewers); these COIs are likewise forever. 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last four years, including co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending paper submissions and co-PIs of accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Potential reviewers who shared your primary institution(s) in the last four years, or where one is actively engaged in discussions about employment with the other person’s institution. 
  When there is a direct funding relationship between an author and a potential reviewer (e.g., the reviewer is a sponsor of an author’s research on behalf of his/her company or vice versa). 
  Among PIs of research structures supported under the same umbrella funding award who (1) participate regularly in non-public meetings sponsored by that umbrella award, and (2) are regularly exposed to presentations or discussions of unpublished work at such meetings. 
  Do not declare a COI for the following cases:  
 You must not declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization or an open-source community, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a COI. 
  Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects without direct collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  Internships constitute a conflict of interest during the period of employment of the intern, but not thereafter, unless some other provision applies (e.g., co-authorship or ongoing research collaboration after the internship). Graduate students are not presumed to have an automatic COI with their undergraduate institution. On the other hand, prospective graduate students do have a COI with any institution they have applied to if they are actively engaged in discussions with any faculty member at that institution. Once they join an institution to pursue graduate studies, automatic COIs with any other prospective institutions sunset. In all these cases, the collaboration COI above still applies. 
  When in doubt, contact the program chairs and ask.  
 Declaring Authors  
 Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  
 Declaring Areas and Topics  
 ASPLOS emphasizes multidisciplinary research. Submissions should ideally – albeit not necessarily – emphasize synergy of two or more of the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems (broadly interpreted). Authors should therefore indicate at least one of these areas on the submission form and, preferably, more than one.  
 Authors should also indicate on the submission form more focused topics matching their work, which will be used for reviewer assignment.  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  
 By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications. Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, web pages, or online repositories such as arxiv.org are not considered prior publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity.  
 The authors additionally guarantee that no manuscript that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted document is or will be under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the ASPLOS review cycle for which it was submitted. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and possibly additional actions against the offending authors.  
 You should also adhere to the ACM Plagiarism Policy ( http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy  ), which covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.  
 As usual, if in doubt, consult with the program chairs.  
 Ethical and Other Obligations  
 Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review. 
  Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members in order to encourage or solicit them to bid on any submission; to attempt to sway a reviewer or PC/ERC member to review any submission positively or negatively; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted manuscripts; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members to ask about the outcomes of any submission. 
  Authors are not allowed to advertise their work during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the results of the review cycle are publicized. The work includes the submission itself and closely related documents such as technical reports or arxiv.org uploads. Advertisement pertains to such communication channels such as social media, community blogs, and web pages. To clarify, authors are indeed allowed to upload their submission to arxiv.org and other such online repositories; the restriction relates to advertising such postings. 
  Authors are not allowed to post in the aforementioned channels about the content of the reviews they may have received until the results of the corresponding review cycle are publicized; “shaming” (and thus potentially applying pressure on) reviewers before the review process terminates is considered unethical. 
  Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ( | https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics | ). 
  Violation of these policies might result in rejection of the submission and possible additional action by the ACM.  
 ACM requires that all submitting authors will be aware of the following policies in particular:  
 By submitting your article to an ACM publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Formatting and Editing  
 We will use the same format template for submission and camera-ready versions. Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class available on the official ACM site  . Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:  
 % use the base acmart.cls  
  % use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts  
  % nonacm option removes ACM related text in the submission.  
  \documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}  
   
  % enable page numbers  
  \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  
   
  \begin{document}  
  \title{...}  
   
  \begin{abstract}  
  ...  
  \end{abstract}  
   
  \maketitle % should come after the abstract  
   
  % add the paper content here  
   
  % use the ACM bibliography style  
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}  
  \bibliography{...}  
   
  \end{document}  Your final submission should visually look similar to this sample  produced from the zip file above.  
 “Squeezing” Space is Forbidden.  Refrain from tweaking the aforementioned template and from formatting your text in a manner that violates its settings. Notably, refrain from squeezing additional space, e.g., by using \vspace or packages that manipulate vertical space. The template already generates a very dense document, and you must not make it denser. Your submission will be visually and automatically inspected using tools developed for this purpose, and it will be rejected if you violate the formatting policy, even if your PDF passed the HotCRP format check (which is unable to verify much of the requirements).  
 Page Layout and Limit.  Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, footnotes, appendices, etc. The only exception is the bibliographic references section, which is not included in the page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, allowing reviewers to evaluate the work without having to consider any external or supplementary material outside this limit. The reviewers greatly value conciseness, so if you can describe your work with fewer pages than the limit, please do. All pages should be numbered.  
 Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions.  The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such. In addition to this +2 automatic page limit increase, authors of accepted papers may purchase 1–2 more pages, if they wish (payment will be processed when registering to the conference).  
 Font Size, Tables, and Figures.  The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible. In particular, text inside figures/tables should generally use what appears to readers as a 9pt font or bigger after any intra-document scaling has been applied. Fonts appearing smaller than 8pt are not permitted. As noted, this and other requirements are not checked automatically by the HotCRP format checker, so it is the authors’ responsibility to check it. Figures can and should use colors but should also be color-blind friendly and readable when printed in monochrome. Spacing between figures/tables/captions/text should be determined by the latex template.  
 References.  Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers. Also, reviewers will very much appreciate clickable links (preferably DOI  s) associated with each entry in your references section.  
 Specifications.  The following table specifies some of the main typeset requirements. Use our mandatory latex template and follow the above instructions to make sure that these and other formatting requirements are met.  
  
 aspect | requirement 
 file format | PDF with numbered pages 
 page limit | 11 pages, not including references 
 paper size | US Letter 8.5in x 11in 
 top margin | 1in 
 bottom margin | 1in 
 left margin | 0.75in 
 right margin | 0.75in 
 column separation | 0.333in 
 body | 2-column, single-spaced 
 body font size | 10pt 
 abstract font | 10pt 
 section heading font | 12pt, bold 
 subsection heading font | 10pt, bold 
 space between section heading and text | ≥ 6pt 
 caption font | 9pt 
 fonts in figures and tables | ≥ 8pt, preferably ≥ 9pt 
 reference entries | 8pt; no page limit; list full names of all author (no “et al.”); include link to document (preferably DOI  ); make references to citations clickable 
 appendices | count towards the page limit 
  
  Submissions that violate any of these restrictions might be rejected without being reviewed.   
 Author Response Period  
 ASPLOS 2024 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting; see exact dates specified above. Authors should generally focus their rebuttal on (1) correcting factual errors in the reviews and (2) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. When a major revision is a realistic possibility, in addition to clarifying the submitted work, rebuttals may describe new experiments and data, if doing so addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Rebuttals are optional but strongly encouraged, and their absence might indicate to reviewers that authors are not interested in improving the work. There is no explicit word limit to a rebuttal, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep it under 800 words, and reviewers are not expected to read words that exceed this limit. Authors are not allowed to attach files to the rebuttal HotCRP comment.  
 Accepted Papers  
 Submissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page). We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot (unless all  authors have difficulty traveling due to such serious limitations as visa restrictions, care-giving responsibilities, and disability). By default, all accepted papers will be made available online to registered attendees before the conference at a date that depends on the review cycle. Papers accepted to the spring and summer deadlines will be published in separate volumes in advance of the conference.  
 ACM requires that all authors of accepted papers will adhere to the following policy. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors  to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will continue in 2025 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the ASPLOS 2025 AEC  web page for more information.  
 Poster and Lightning Sessions  
 In addition to the regular presentations, the program may include poster and lightning sessions. If those are included, details can be found here when they become available.  
 Wild and Crazy Ideas Session  
 The program will also tentatively include a WACI session. Details will become available later.  
 Debate Session  
 Should the program include a debate session, details will be posted here.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The committee will select a handful of papers to receive a Best Paper Award. The decision may or may not be communicated to the winning authors prior to the official announcement at the opening session of the conference.  
 Program and Registration  
 Complete program and registration information will be available on the conference website as soon as it becomes available.  
 Confidentiality  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

 2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS @Berlin, Germany  

 Welcome  
 Welcome to the home of the 2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference  , to be held in Berlin, Germany, on June 22 - 27, 2025.  
 The Conference.  The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.  
 The Berlin Area.  Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is located in the heart of Europe. With 50 lakes, three rivers (Havel, Spree, and Dahme), and eight canals, Berlin is a water city with around 1,000 bridges, significantly more than Venice. The federal capital has about 3.9 million inhabitants and is Germany's number one cultural melting pot. People from all over the world have shaped the city. Nowhere else in Germany can you find so many world-famous sights, events, flair, charm, entertainment options, a vibrant nightlife, a vast shopping world, and boundless culinary diversity.  
 The Conference Hotel.  The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard façade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous "Tiergarten" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis. It is one of Germany's leading conference and event venues, providing an outstanding stage for events of all kinds. It was honored with the "Europe's Leading Conference Hotel" award at the World Travel Awards 2024.

 Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues  
 The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment  . Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.  
 For more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/   
 Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.  
 Inclusion  
 Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:  
  
 Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:   
 Implicit assumption: | An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents. 
  Oppressive terminology: | Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in | this article | . 
  Marginalization of URGs: | An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities. 
  Lack of accessibility: | Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple 
  Stereotyping: | Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles. 
   
 Diversity  
 Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.  
 Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:   
 Embracing different cultures: | Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., | this article | on names across different cultures. 
  Embracing differences in figures: | Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people. 
  Embracing gender diversity in pronouns: | Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles. 
   
 Responsibility  
 Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article  discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article  also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.

 Preface    
 Welcome  to  the pr  oceedings  of  the  8th wo  rking  conference  on  the  Practice  of   
 Enterprise Mode l ling (PoEM  2015)  that was  held during  November  10 - 12 in a       
 beautiful and  modern  city of  Valencia, Spain,  and  host  ed  by the  Research Center in      
 Software Production Methods (PROS ) of the Unive  rsidad Politécni  ca de Valencia .      
 Enterprise  modelling  (EM)  encloses  a  set  of  activities  by  which  several   
 perspectives  on  an  organisation  are  elicited,  documented,  analysed  and   
 communicated,  typically  through  a  structure  d,  iterative ,  stakeholder -    centric  and   
 model - based  approach.  This  way,  the  knowledge  of  the  enterpri  se  is  made  explicit     
 and  further acti  ons  can be  performed,  like  making  strategic  decisions,  undertaking   
 organisational reengineering, standardising ways  of wo rking, developing or  acquiring    
 information an  d communication technolog  y, etc. As a  consequence,  EM has  an   
 impact  in  large  economic  markets  such  as  consulting  and  information  system    
 development, making it a relevant field of r  esearch and industrial practice .    
 The  PoEM series  of conferences  started in  2008 aiming  at  pro  viding  a forum  for   
 sharing experiences  and knowledge  of  EM  between the  academic  community and     
 practitioners  from industry  and the  public  sector. PoEM  is  supported by  the  IFIP    
 WG8.1  a  nd  is a  very interesting  and dyna  mic event where  new  researc  h  challen  ges       
 emerge  from EM  practices –  success  and failure  stories related  by  practitioners, and     
 vice versa, practitioners take the oppor  tunity to learn about new EM solutions .    
 This year, PoEM was very success  ful  by receiving  72 submissions covering a large      
 variety of EM  topics. Each  paper was evaluated  by  at  least  thr  ee Program Committee    
 members and  got constructive recommendations for further improvement . After the        
 examination of r  eviews, 23 paper  s have  been selected for  the presentation at  the     
 conference  and  are included in these proceedi  ngs.  They   are  organi s    ed  in 8 sections    
 corresponding to the conference  sessions : Evolving Enterprises, S   ecuring  E nt  erprises,     
 M aking  E mpirical  S tudies,  I nvestigating       E nterprise  M    ethods,  A  cquiring  User     
 I nformation,  M anaging  R isks  and  T      hreats,  E  ngineering  M ethods  and   M aking      
 D ecisions in E nterprises.       
 In addition to  full research papers ,  we have  selected  9  short papers  presenting        
 research  work s  in  progress  and  case  studies . D  uring the  conferen  ce they have been       
 presented  in  dedicated  sessions  a  nd  are   published  in  the  CEUR  on  line   pr  oceedings     
 ( CEUR  - WS  .org).     
 The conference  audience  also enjoyed  of  three   outstanding keynote  presentations :      
 two  from  academy and  one  from  industry .  Professo  r Pericles  Loucopo  ulos  from the       
 Manchester Business  School  of  th  e  Universit  y  of  Manchest  er  (UK) gave  a  talk  on     
 “ What Could the Role  of Enterpris  e Modelling be during  t  he 5th  Economic  Phase? ”        
 Professor  Larr  y  Constantine, a  Fellow of  the  Association for  Computing Machinery    
 and a Life Member of the Industrial Designers Society of America , delivered  a lecture      
 on  “ Missing  Model  s: Understanding  Hu  man  Activity  in  t  he  Enterprise .”  Finally,  a          
 presentation with a  practitione  r perspective was given by  a representa tive from     
 industry,  Rafael  Mo n   tes  ,  from  TecnoGram  Procesos   ,  on  “ Event  Sourcing       
 Implementation of a BPM System: A P ractical Experience .”       

 This year’s  PoEM proposed  a few novelties  – a  traditionally two - days  conferenc  e       
 was extended by one day and complemented   with three additional events  : a workshop     
 named AMINO  (towa rds the Model  drIveN  Organization  ), a  doctoral consortium  and      
 a Young  Entrepreneur Seminar (yes!PoEM 2015).  We hope that all parti  cipants , both      
 from academia and industry , enjoyed  t  he conference scientific and social program   and     
 acquired inspiration for their research and industrial innovation.       
 To  conclude, we  would  like to  express  our gratitude  to  a number  of  people who   
 spent their  time and energy  in organising and   successful ly   running PoEM 2015.  First      
 of  all we  thank  the Program  Committee members and  additional  reviewers  for  their      
 help in selecting the papers for the  scientific program of the conference ,    the authors of     
 the  papers  for  their confidence   in PoEM, and  the  presenters and  Session  Chairs for      
 lively  presentations  and  discussions. We  are  grateful  to     the  PoEM  S  teering   
 C ommittee C  hairs for their continuous assistance, and the Chairs  of workshops,     
 doctoral consortium and  yes!PoEM for creating an  exciting event. Finally, w  e  extend    
 our gratitude to  the local  organising team  at the  Universidad Politécnica de Valencia       
 for their hospitality  and the organi s  ation of the social events of the conference .

  8th IFIP WG 8.1 working conference on the Practice of Enterprise Modelling 

 Today’s dynamic business environment presents enterprises that wish to stay competitive with a great challenge. This is further complicated by rapidly advancing IT capabilities and the crucial role that IT plays in most organizations - a backbone for realizing visions and goals. The problem of eliminating the gap between business and IT within enterprises, i.e. the problem of Business and IT Alignment (BITA), has been acknowledged as a contemporary challenge and actively elaborated by academics and practitioners. One practice that is used to facilitate BITA is Enterprise Modeling (EM), which is considered as a catalyzing practice for capturing, visualizing and analyzing different aspects of enterprises. This paper presents a framework that illustrates the role of EM in the context of BITA and suggests recommendations to deal with EM challenges.

 A Generic Goal Model to Support Continuous Improvement in SME Construction Companies.    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.pp 27-42 

 Small and medium sized (SME) construction companies are often good at bricks, mortar and carpentry but not at management. However, it is often bad management that hinders companies to become financially sustainable over time and to grow. This paper presents a generic goal model aiming to support SME construction companies to systematically work with continuous improvement towards the overarching goal of becoming thriving businesses. The goal model has been developed based on the principles of lean, balanced scorecards and the business canvas, as well as on a management consultant’s experiences from working with this kind of companies for many years.   

 A Risk-Based Approach Supporting Enterprise Architecture Evolution    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  PoEM 2015 

 Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to the complex dependencies amongst EA models when evolving towards different alternatives (To-be models). In this paper, we present an approach supporting design decision during EA evolution. The idea is to reason on (To-be) models when evolving to a posterior state. To that end, we rationalize on a set of design decisions that are mapped on a non deterministic finite automaton, which is then evaluated by Markov decision processes. The idea consists of computing EA models valuations while integrating both alternatives rewards and risks metrics. In doing so, we consider risk as a correctness factor to choose the best alternative. Finally, we simulate our risk-based approach using a manufacturing scenario and discuss its usefulness and applicability.   

 Pattern-Based Security Requirements Derivation from Secure Tropos Models    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.59-74 

 The increasing rates of cyber-attacks have led to the subsequent need to rapidly develop secure information systems (IS). Secure Tropos is an actor and goal-oriented approach to identify security goals and to enable security requirements elicitation. This is achieved by considering system actors, their dependencies and by deriving security constraints that actors need to satisfy. Nevertheless goal-oriented modelling has proven itself to be valid it also contains few shortcomings. One of them is the high granularity of the process, which leads quickly to high complexity models. Security patterns are proven to be reusable solutions that address recurring security problems. In this paper we investigate the integration of a pattern-based security requirements derivation from the Secure Tropos models.

 Conference Paper

  PoEM2015 

 Analyzing security from an attacker's perspective has been accepted as an effective approach for dealing with security requirements for complex systems. However, there is no systematic approach for constructing attack scenarios. As a result, the completeness of the derived attack scenarios is subject to the expertise of analysts. In this paper, we propose a systematic process for identifying attack scenarios to support security analysis, founded on anti-goal refinement. In particular, we examine three real attack scenarios in order to understand attack strategies that have been applied in reality. Based on our examination, we propose a comprehensive anti-goal refinement framework, which consists of five anti-goal refinement patterns and an analysis process for using the patterns as part of security design. Finally, we evaluate the proposed anti-goal refinement framework by applying it to a credit card theft scenario .

 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.91-107 

 The modernisation of enterprise legacy systems, without compromises in their functionality, is a demanding and time consuming endeavour. To retain the underlying business behaviour during their modernisation, the MARBLETM framework has been developed for the extraction of business process models from their source code. Building on top of that work, in this paper we propose an integrated approach for transforming the extracted legacy process models into Secure Tropos goal models. Such models facilitate the elicitation of security requirements in a high level of abstraction, which are then incorporated back into the process models of the modernised systems as security features. Therefore high level models can be derived from legacy source code with minimal manual intervention, where security can be elaborated by non-technical stakeholders in alignment with organisational objectives.   

 Testing a Selection of BPMN Tools for Their Support of Modelling Guidelines    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.111–125 

 BPMN has become the de facto standard notation for process modelling. Past research has demonstrated the need for modelling guidelines to improve the quality of process models. In previous research we collected a set of practical guidelines through a systematic literature survey and classified those in different categories. In this paper we test a selection of BPMN tools for their support for these guidelines, and report on existing support per category of guideline and the kinds of support used by the tool to support the different guidelines. The results give insight into which domains of guidelines are well supported and which lack support from BPMN tools. Further, different preferences of the vendors are observed regarding the methods of support they implement in their tools.   

 Consistently Formalizing a Business Process and its Properties for Verification: A Case Study    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.126-140 

 Formal verification of business process models can be done through model checking (also known as property checking), where a model checker tool may automatically find violations of properties in a process model. This approach obviously has formal representations as a prerequisite. However, a key challenge for applying this approach in practice is to consistently formalize the process and its properties, which clearly cannot be done automatically. We studied this challenge in a case study of formally verifying an informally given business process against a guideline written like a legal text. Major lessons learned from this case study are that formalizing is key to success and that in its course a semi-formal representation of properties is useful. In the course of such a step-wise and incremental formalization, problems with the given process model have been found already, apart from those found with a model checker tool that used the formal property specification. In total, our approach revealed five problems not found by the official review. In summary, this paper investigates in a case study consistently formalizing a business process and its properties for verification through model checking.   

 Dealing with Risks and Workarounds: A Guiding Framework    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  8th IFIP WG 8.1. Working Conference, PoEM 2015 

 We present rISk-arounD, an enterprise-wide framework for modeling risks and workarounds in conformity with ISO 9001. The mode of inquiry is the canonical action research (CAR), conducted in a metalworking company. Our contribution suggests that (1) risks and workarounds should be jointly considered to model uncertainty in organizations, (2) participative enterprise modeling can assist process improvement and regulatory compliance, and (3) it is also necessary to address informal “shadow” practices in enterprise models. Moreover, we discuss how to adopt CAR to promote a culture of participative enterprise modeling. This framework can help organizations in their transition to the new 2015 version of ISO 9001, which endorses process oriented approaches and riskbased thinking as top priorities.   

 Case-Based Development of Consumer Preferences Using Brand Personality and Values Co-creation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.159-173 

 Consumers have preferences whose determination is outside the realm of economic rules and values. To be successful in current market conditions, product and service companies need to capture such preferences to provide best-fit support by their Information Systems (IS), sometimes by developing entirely new features. In our previous work, we have conceptualized a meta-model for incorporating consumer preferences into the development of IS —Consumer Preference Meta-Model (CPMM). This artifact was developed with the ability to be expanded with new kinds of consumer preferences, as well as their related concepts. Building upon that work, in this study we consider methodological usage of CPMM for the case of Asker’s Brand Personality as the primary value framework. The framework brings both the enterprise and the consumer into dialog, with this values co-creation fostering synchronicity between the information systems that are designed as an outgrowth of this process, and the desires of both the consumers and the businesses that they will support. The case example uses the Twitter feed of a major airline, whose tweets are processed using Aaker’s 5-factors and Kano’s quality framework. The results complete an instantiation of CPMM that generates a feature model reflective of both brand personality and values co-creation.   

 Modelling Users Feedback in Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering: An Empirical Study

  pp.174-190 

 Most enterprises operate within a complex and ever-changing context. To ensure that requirements keep pace with changing context, users’ feedback is advocated to ensure that the requirements knowledge is refreshed and reflects the degree to which the system meets its design objectives. The traditional approach to users’ feedback, which is based on data mining and text analysis, is often limited, partly due to the ad-hoc nature of users’ feedback and, also, the methods used to acquire it. To maximize the expressiveness of users’ feedback and still be able to efficiently analyse it, we propose that feedback acquisition should be designed with that goal in mind. This paper contributes to that aim by presenting an empirical study that investigates users’ perspectives on feedback constituents and how they could be structured. This will provide a baseline for modelling and customizing feedback for enterprise systems in order to maintain and evolve their requirements.   

 Factors Influencing Productization of Enterprise Modeling: A Qualitative Inquiry into the Scandinavian Strand of Methods and Tools    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  The Practice of Enterprise Modeling, 8th IFIP WG 8.1. Working Conference, PoEM 2015 

 Enterprise Modeling (EM) methods and tools have been developed and successfully used for more than two decades yet their adoption in organizations is mostly ad hoc. Only a few EM methods and tools have become successful products despite being theoretically sound and having certain success in application in practice. This grounded theory inquiry ponders on what factors influence the successful productization of EM methods and tools. Among the factors discussed are EM maturity gap, method and tool development process, application context, marketing and sales aspects, as well as product aspects.   

 Methods in Designing and Developing Capabilities: A Systematic Mapping Study    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.209-222 

 Enterprises operate in dynamically changing environments that have an influence on both business and IT areas. Capabilities have been proposed as instruments to align business and IT in such environments. One aim of enterprise modelling is a better communication between the stakeholders of an enterprise at various levels. Thus, the alignment can be facilitated by the exploitation of enterprise models as an abstraction instrument. In this respective the paper analyses the methods for capability design and development from the enterprise modelling perspective by conducting a mapping study, i.e. the level of methodological support for capability modelling is investigated. For this purpose 112 journals and 24 conference proceedings were analysed. The most important findings are that the research in capability design (i) adopts empirical research, mostly in form of case studies and surveys (ii) is mainly motivated by Resource Based View (RBV) and changing environments (iii) proposes development approaches and frameworks as solution artefacts, (iv) lately receives attention in the Information Systems Development & Tools of MIS subject classification lately, (v) provides a scarce methodological support that is mostly represented as procedures and most importantly (vi) only to some extent exploit enterprise models that could enhance stakeholder communication at various abstraction levels.

  8th IFIP WG 8.1 working conference on the Practice of Enterprise Modelling 

 Excellence in IT is a key enabler for the digital transformation of enterprises. To realize the vision of Digital Enterprises it is necessary to cope with changing business requirements and to align business and IT. In order to evaluate the contribution of Enterprise Architecture Management to these goals, our paper explores the impact of various factors to the perceived benefit of EAM in enterprises. Based on literature, we build an empirical research model. It is tested with empirical data of European EAM experts using a structural equation modelling approach. It is shown that changing business requirements, IT Business Alignment, the complexity of Information Technology infrastructure as well as enterprise architecture knowledge of Information Technology employees are crucial impact factors to the perceived benefit of EAM in enterprises.   

 Using Value Models for Business Risk Analysis in e-Service Networks

  pp.239-253 

 Commercially provided electronic services commonly operate on top of a complex, highly-interconnected infrastructure, which provides a multitude of entry points for attackers. Providers of e-services also operate in dynamic, highly competitive markets, which provides fertile ground for fraud. Before a business idea to provide commercial e-services is implemented in practice, it should therefore be analysed on its fraud potential. This analysis is a risk assessment process, in which risks are ordered on severity and the unacceptable ones are mitigated. Mitigations may consist of changes in the e-service network to reduce the attractiveness of fraud for the fraudster, or changes in coordination process steps or IT architecture elements to make fraud harder or better detectable. We propose to use \(e^{3}\) value business value models for the identification and quantification of risks associated with e-service packages. This allows for impact estimation as well as understanding the attacker’s business cases. We show how the \(e^{3}\) value ontology — with minimal extensions – can be used to analyse known telecommunication fraud scenarios. We also show how the approach can be used to quantify infrastructure risks. Based on the results, as well as feedback from practitioners, we discuss the scope and limits of generalizability of our approach.

  The Practice of Enterprise Modeling (PoEM'15) 

 The Requirements Engineering (RE) community recognizes the importance of trust proposing several approaches to model and analyze trust requirements. However, such approaches mainly focus on trust as social relations without relating them to the requirements of the sys-tem's components. We propose a belief-based trust approach based on an extended version of Secure Tropos, where social relations are modeled and analyzed along with beliefs concerning capabilities and motivations of system's components. An example concerning US stock market crash (the Flash Crash) is used to illustrate our approach.   

 An Experience Report of Improving Business Process Compliance Using Security Risk-Oriented Patterns    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.271-285 

 Nowadays enterprises are searching the efficient compliance management method. Being compliant could potentially help capturing the most important information, using practice and existing process solutions; thus reducing the management effort and cost. When it comes to the security compliance management, it means treating and reducing the security risks to the acceptable level and employing the validated and cost effective security countermeasures. However, the typical question that small and medium enterprises face, is on how to achieve the security compliance in the efficient way. In this paper we report on our experience to use the security risk-oriented patterns to improve business processes of the insurance brokerage. The analysed case showed the major steps to apply the regulatory standard to check compliance, as well as the major procedures needed to improve the business process compliance. The lessons learnt highlight some method guidelines toward compliance management and suggest needed improvement directions for the application of the security risk-oriented patterns.   

 Towards an OSS Adoption Business Impact Assessment    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.289-305 

 Nowadays, the adoption of Open Source Software (OSS) by organizations is becoming a strategic need in a wide variety of application areas. Organizations adopt OSS in very diverse ways. The way in which they adopt OSS affects and shapes their businesses. Therefore, knowing the impact of different OSS adoption strategies in the context of an organization may help improving the processes undertaken inside this organization and ultimately pave the road to strategic moves. However, there is a lack of support for assessing the impact of the OSS adoption over the business of the adopter organizations. Based on the goal-oriented characterization of some OSS adoption strategies, in this paper, we propose a preliminary approach to assess the business impact of the OSS adoption strategies over the adopter organizations. The proposal is based on the Business Model Canvas and graph theory notions to support the elicitation and assessment of the impact of each goal over the adopter organization. We illustrate the application of the approach in the context of a telecommunications company.   

 The Concepts of Decision Making: An Analysis of Classical Approaches and Avenues for the Field of Enterprise Modeling    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  8th IFIP WG 8.1. Working Conference, PoEM 2015, Valencia, Spain, November 10–12, 2015 

 The field of enterprise modeling seeks to help make organizational decisions that take place under conditions of complexity, ambiguity, and conflicting views. But available concepts to describe decision situations are still in their infancy. A variety of existing model-based approaches to aid decision making have been developed in adjacent research fields. The paper investigates a selection of these approaches and reconstructs central concepts in the form of meta models. Implications and ways of integrating decision concepts with existing enterprise modeling methods are considered, and possible avenues for the field of enterprise modeling are discussed.

  pp.322-337 

 DevOps is a software development approach that enables enterprises to rapidly deliver software product features through process automation, greater inter-team collaboration and increased efficiency introduced through monitoring and measuring activities. No two enterprise-adopted DevOps approaches would be similar as each enterprise has unique characteristics and requirements. At present, there is no structured method in enterprise architecture modeling that would enable enterprises to devise a DevOps approach suitable for their requirements while considering possible process reconfigurations. Any DevOps implementation can have variations at different points across development and operational processes and enterprises need to be able to systematically map these variation points and understand the trade-offs involved in selecting one alternative over another. In this paper, we use our previously proposed Business Process Architecture modeling technique to express and analyze DevOps alternatives and help enterprises select customized DevOps processes that match their contexts and requirements.

 As organizations are becoming more complex, Enterprise Architecture (EA) serves as an important means to align the strategy with the operations and to achieve business/IT (i.e., Information Technology) alignment. Although numerous approaches have been designed for large enterprises, little EA research was oriented towards small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, both organizational types are fundamentally different and require a tailored approach. Therefore, CHOOSE was designed as an EA approach that is in accordance with the needs of SMEs. By performing a case study in the department of a large enterprise, this paper aims to investigate how CHOOSE can be used outside its original context. More specifically, it will be examined how the metamodel and modeling method could be extended to deliver an overview and valuable insights about a complex business reality. To realize this, potential solutions for the encountered issues are formulated and evaluated by the involved business stakeholders.   

 Agile Modelling Method Engineering: Lessons Learned in the ComVantage Research Project    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  IFIP Working Conference on The Practice of Enterprise Modeling 
  pp.356-373 

 The paper reports on experiences accumulated during a EU research project where challenges pertaining to requirements-driven metamodelling agility have been analysed. Traditionally, modelling languages are perceived as stable artefacts – that is, if they address a sufficiently large community with fixed modelling requirements on a fixed layer of abstraction. However, the enterprise modelling community must also consider the case where evolving requirements emerge in a narrow domain, or even in a single enterprise, therefore reusability across domains will be sacrificed to the benefit of on-demand adaptation, specialization or integration. Under such conditions, an agile metamodelling approach was applied in the ComVantage project and this, in turn, raised specific requirements for conceptual and technological enablers, allowing us to derive conclusions that are generalized here beyond the project scope. The paper’s concluding SWOT analysis highlights the need to stimulate the emergence of an agile metamodelling paradigm based on community-driven enablers.   

 Towards DW Support for Formulating Policies

 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2015 
  PoEM 2015 

 Data warehousing is largely directed towards “what to do next” type of decisions that essentially address operational decision-making needs. We argue for developing data warehouse support for deciding on organizational policies: policies evolve and therefore need continual decision-making support. We propose an RE approach for discovering information contents of a data warehouse for policy decision-making. Each policy is represented in an extended first order logic that can be converted into a policy hierarchy. Each node in this hierarchy can be selected, rejected, or modified. In order to take this decision, the relevant information is determined by using Ends Information Elicitation and Critical Success Factor Elicitation techniques for information elicitation. The elicited information is converted into an ER diagram from which star schemas are obtained.

 In today's global and complex business environment, security is a major issue for any organization. All organizations should have the capability to plan and respond to incidents and business disruptions. Business continuity management is part of information security management and the process of Business continuity management (BCM) can meet these needs. Indeed, Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue its operations even if some sort of failure or disaster occurs. Business continuity management (BCM) requires a holistic approach that considers technological and organizational aspects. Besides, Enterprise architecture (EA) is a comprehensive view of organizational architecture, business, and technology architecture and their relationships. EA is also considered by several studies as a foundation for BC and security management. Our research aims at studying how BCM aspect can be embedded into the enterprise architecture. In this sense, this paper proposes a metamodel and an implementation method that considers BC in the design and implementation of EA.

 The modelling landscape experiences a rich proliferation of modelling language, or metamodel. The emergence of cross-disciplinary disciplines, such as enterprise engineering and service engineering, necessitates a multi-perspective approach to traverse the component from strategic level to technological aspect. This paper aims to find a unifying structure of metamodels introduced by academics and industries. A grounded approach is taken to define the structure by collating the metamodels to form an emerging structure. Metamodels were collected from a literature survey from several interrelated disciplines: software engineering, system engineering, enterprise architecture, service engineering, business process management and financial accounting. The result suggests seven stereotypes of metamodel, characterized by its label: goal, enterprise, business model, service, process, software and system. The aspect of “process” holds a central role in connecting all other aspect in the modelling continuum. Service engineering can be viewed as an alternative abstraction of enterprise engineering in containing the concepts of “business model”, “capability”, “value”, “interaction”, “process” and “software”. Metamodel collection was performed to emphasize on representativeness rather than comprehensiveness, in which old and unpopular metamodel were disregarded unless it offer unique characteristic not yet represented in the collection. Owing to its bottom-up approach, the paper is not intended to identify a gap in metamodel offering. This paper produces a structure of metamodel landscape in a graphical format to illustrate correlation between metamodels in which evolutive patterns of metamodel proliferation can be observed. The produced structure can serve as map in metamodel continuum.

  Enterprise modelling has been used traditionally to elicit and document phenomena related to organisations. It has proven to be valueble within research and industry projects in the domains of enterprise engineering and information systems engineering. Yet, in this work, we apply enterprise modelling as a research method to investigate the links between ethical, social and environmental ... [Show full abstract]  accounting (a.k.a. sustainability reporting) and strategic management practices. Such links have been theorised or anecdotically reported in scientific literature within the fields of sustainability management, accounting, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance. But, to date, there has been no rigorous investigation into the concrete ways in which both practices interrelate. In this work, we conduct six literature-based case studies and five observational case studies within large companies, applying enteprise modelling to reveal the links between sustainability reporting and strategic management and document them. We have found evidences in all case studies, demonstrating that such form of accounting has value for stragegic management, who uses the reported results to steer the company and determine organisational policies. Strategic managers also provide input that the accounting department uses to adapt the ethical, social and environmental accounting method to the needs of strategic managers. These results open up new avenues of research in sustainability reporting, and supports our claim that enterprise modelling is a valid and useful research method beyond enterprise and information systems engineering.

 PoEM 2015 Short Papers Foreword       
 The  8 th  IFIP  WG  8.1  working  c onference  on  the  Practice  of  Enterprise  Model l    ing     
 ( PoEM  2015 ) was  held in  Valencia ,    Spain,  from  10 to  12  November  2015 . Since  its     
 foundation in 2008, the PoEM  conference series aims at understanding and imp  roving      
 the  practice  of  Enterprise  Modelling  (EM)  by  offering   a  forum  for  sharing   
 experiences and knowledge  between the  academic community  and practitioners  from     
 industry  and  the  public  sector. It  has  traditionally  covered    topics   such  as  EM   and   
 information  system  development,  enterprise  arch  itecture,  business  and  IT  alignment,   
 EM  and business  process  improvement,  Enterprise  modelling  too  ls an  d f  rameworks,    
 quality  issues  in  EM,  change  management  and  organizational  transformation   
 underpinned by information technology approaches.    
 This edition, PoEM received  72 submissions covering a large variety of EM topics.      
 All  submissions  were  subject  to  peer  review  and  were  assessed  by  at  least  3   
 Programme  Commit  tee  members,   who  provided  constructive  recommendations  for    
 further  improvement .  This  CEUR  Proceedings  volume  contains  the  accepted  9  short    
 papers.  Full  papers  are  available  in  the  PoEM  201 5   Proceedings,  published      by   
 Springer on  the  volume  235  of  their  Lecture  Notes  in  Business  Information      
 Processing series  .  The  authors  of  the se  short  papers represent      8  countries:  Brazil,       
 Germany,  Israel  ,  Italy  ,  Luxembourg  ,    Norway  ,  Sweden  and  Swit  zerland .  T he  papers         
 were  presented  in  two  sessions:  Reflecting  on  Practice  and  Experiences ,  and       
 Approaching Enter  prise Modelling  from New Angles .

 PoEM 2015 Doctoral Consortium Foreword    
 PoEM 2015  has  organised  and  held  a  Doctoral  Consortium  for the  first  time  in  this     
 series of conferences. The ambition behind  was to enrich the PoEM conference with  a   
 forum  intended  to  bring  together  PhD   students  working  on  foundations,  methods,   
 tools and appli cations of Enterprise Modelling, and provide them w  ith the opportunity    
 to present and discuss their research  with other academics.    
 In  p  articular,  the  goals  of  the  Doctoral  Consortium   were  to  provide  fruitful   
 feedback  and  advice  to  the  selected PhD  students  on  their  research  studies,  to  meet     
 senior  academics  do  ing  research  on  topics  related  to  the  Enterprise  Modelling   
 discipline,  as  well  as  to  interact w  ith other  PhD   students and  stimulate  exchange  of   
 ideas and suggestions among p  articipants.    
 The  PoEM  2015  D octoral  Consortium  received  8  submissions  from  Belgium,    
 Canada,  France, Germany,  Italy,  Sweden, Tunisia  and  United  Kingdom,  5  of  which   
 were accepted. Eac  h paper was reviewed by t  wo members of the Progra  m Committee,   
 and also assessed by the Doctoral Consort ium Chairs.     
 The  Doctoral  Consortium  included  a  tuto  rial  by  Prof.  Paul  Johannesson  from   
 Stockholm University, “Design Science - a Ritual  for Legitimating Weak Research or     
 a  Tool  for  Making  Research  Relevant?”  In  addition  the  five  accepted  papers  w  ere   
 presented and discussed.    
 We would like to express our  gratitude to the mento  rs of the Doctoral Consor  tium,   
 as  well  as  to  the mem  bers  of  the  Program  Committee for  their   efforts  in  providing   
 very thorough evaluations of the  submitted doctoral papers. We also wish  to thank all     
 PhD  students  who  submitted  papers  for  having  shared  their  work  with  us.  We  owe   
 special  thanks  to  the  Programme  Chairs  and  the  Local  Organisation  Committee  of   
 PoEM 2015 for their support.

 PODS 2025 CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS  
 The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or nontraditional (see https://databasetheory.org/PODS).  
 The 2025 conference will be held in Berlin, Germany.  
 Mission  
 The PODS community has a pivotal position in the research of computer science. It aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others. The PODS community is an open space where researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management.  
 Scope  
 PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. At a time when computer science is increasingly data-centric, it is essential to promote an active exchange of tools and techniques between PODS and other communities focused on data management. PODS thus pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.  
 Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:  
 Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing 
  Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints 
  Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions 
  Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration 
  Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams 
  Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data 
  Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access 
  Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management 
  Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries 
  Connections between database principles and other disciplines 
  Submission Site  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025   
 Submission Format  
 Important: The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.   
 LaTex users must format their submission using the standard ACM "acmsmall" proceedings stylesheet:  
 https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   
 They must use the following class declaration:  
  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 A submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops.  
 Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD ( https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod  ) journal. Authors of papers published in the PACMMOD issues of PODS 2025 will be invited to present their work at the SIGMOD/PODS conference. PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process. This implies that submitted papers must adhere to the double-blind reviewing policy described below and, in addition, authors must provide a list of potential conflicts of interest at the moment of submission.  
 Double-anonymous reviewing  
 PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:  
 Author names and institutions must be omitted. 
  References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. 
  Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed. 
  However, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  
 Merit-based acceptance  
 The paper selection will be merit-based. We have no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers. As such, paper selection is strongly based on the individual contribution of papers and less so on the number of papers ranked higher in the conference tool. The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.  
 Important Dates

 Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues  
 The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment  . Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.  
 For more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/   
 Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.  
 Inclusion  
 Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:  
  
 Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:   
 Implicit assumption: | An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents. 
  Oppressive terminology: | Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in | this article | . 
  Marginalization of URGs: | An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities. 
  Lack of accessibility: | Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple 
  Stereotyping: | Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles. 
   
 Diversity  
 Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.  
 Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:   
 Embracing different cultures: | Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., | this article | on names across different cultures. 
  Embracing differences in figures: | Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people. 
  Embracing gender diversity in pronouns: | Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles. 
   
 Responsibility  
 Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article  discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article  also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.

 SIGMOD 2025 CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS  
 Berlin, Germany, 2025, https://2025.sigmod.org   
 ACM SIGMOD is a leading international forum for data management research. Through the conference, participants will explore cutting edge ideas and results, and exchange techniques, tools and experiences.  
 Major Changes from Prior Years  
 Please make note of the following changes well before you submit your paper:  
 1 Year Wait: | Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed. I.e. a paper rejected at Round 4 of SIGMOD 2024 can only be resubmitted to Round 4 of SIGMOD 2025. A paper rejected at Round 2 can be resubmited to Round 2, 3, and 4 of SIGMOD 2025. 
  ORCIDs: | ORCIDs are required for all authors at the time of abstract submission. See | Submission Guidelines | . 
  Abstract, COIs and Paper Submission Dates: | Abstracts and COIs are submitted a week ahead of the main paper submission on Jan 10, Apr 10, Jul 10 or Oct 10. See | Dates | . 
  No Special Tracks: | Previous data-intensive and data science applications tracks are now folded into the main research track, although they retain unique criteria. See | Topics | . 
  No Author Feedback Phase: | There will be no author feedback phase this year. See | Review Process | . 
  Shepherding in place of Revision Requirements: | Initial feedback from reviews will be an unambiguous Accept or Reject. Accepted papers may have revision requirements from the reviews; a shepherd will assist authors of accepted papers in meeting these requirements. See | Review Process | . 
  Posters and Random Selection for Presentation: | Every accepted paper will be allocated a poster presentation slot. However, due to ever-increasing numbers of accepted papers, there will not be a speaking slot for each accepted paper in 2025. Instead, speaking slots will be allocated via random sampling among accepted papers. See | Presentation | .

 DISSEMINATION  
 The rights of all ACM published authors are detailed at: https://authors.acm.org/author-services/author-rights   
 All accepted papers will also appear in a timely manner in an archival journal: Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD) at https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod  .  
 PRESENTATION  
 Authors of accepted publications will be assigned a time to present a poster of their work at the poster plenaries in the conference. All papers are strongly encouraged to present a poster at these plenaries.  
 The number of SIGMOD submissions has been growing steadily over many years. To accommodate publication growth while maintaining an engaging and communal in-person conference, SIGMOD 2025 will randomly  select a subset of accepted papers for presentation at the conference. Authors of randomly selected papers will be invited to present their paper in a speaking slot at the conference.  
 A random sample of papers ensures a fair selection process, reflects the main themes of the pool of accepted papers, and maintains the principle that all papers regardless of presentation selection are of full SIGMOD quality.  
 REVIEW PROCESS  
 Each submission will receive three  reviews.  
  In response to community feedback, there will be no  author feedback this year. Moreover, unlike past years, all papers will receive an initial Accept or Reject decision upon completion of reviews. In lieu of the revision requests from prior years, many accepted papers will be assigned a shepherd  to guide authors through revisions. Final acceptance is contingent upon satisfying shepherding requests.  
   
 Timeline   
 These are rough timelines that are subject to change.  
 Submission to Notification is 6 weeks

 Common revision requests can include  
 justify a crucial assumption, 
  improve motivation of the potential benefits of the work, 
  clean up notation, tighten presentation, 
  compare against specific relevant prior work, 
  show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or with richer statistical properties. 
   
 Revision requests must be reasonably achievable in time for resubmission, and will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original.  
 One extra content page is allowed to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.  
 In addition to the revised submission and cover letter, authors are encouraged to include a visual diff of the original and revised versions (e.g. via latexdiff or word processing tools that Track Changes).

  Accepted papers will need to be ported to the PACMMOD format for final publication. Do not use PACMMOD format for submission or review. 
   
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)   
   
 Each author | is responsible for entering their | ORCID | , own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT. You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID: the one used at submission will be used for publication. 
  An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions. 
  Conflicts are | not | declared per submission. 
  Conflict declaration must occur prior to paper submission. 
   
 It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.  
 Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Definition of Conflict of Interest   
  A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past five years. | 1 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past five years. | 2 
  The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
   
 1  Short-term associations, such as summer internships do not constitute institutional COIs. E.g., a student who interned at Microsoft should declare as conflicts any individuals in the group they worked with and other collaborators on their projects, but they should not declare a domain conflict with microsoft.com.  
 2  Collaborations are indicated by prior co-authorships, shared grant funding, and close research relationships, even if those have not yet resulted in common publications. Publications (typically with a large set of authors) that fall outside the traditional sense of research collaborations (e.g., “The Seattle Report on Database Research”, “ Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Report”, etc.) do not in themselves constitute a COI.  
 To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members may be asked to confirm declared conflicts with submitting authors.  
 Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirement   
  Following the ACM guidelines  a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected — or withdrawn at your request — from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.  
 To enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.  
 Every research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more, presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication (respecting the double anonymity requirement), and clearly indicate which parts of the work appeared in prior publications and which parts are novel to the current submission.  
 Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.   
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   
  As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing   
  We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.  
 Please visit this page for many examples of both exclusionary writing to avoid and inclusive writing that celebrates diversity to consider adopting: https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html  .  
 Authors are further encouraged to follow the tips and guidelines provided at: https://dbdni.github.io/#materials  .  
 Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in writing.  
 Please see https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter  for inclusive alternatives for some of the terms commonly used in the computing profession.  
 Policy on Authorship Requirements   
  We follow the ACM policy on authorship requirements  . Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: "Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work."  
 Anonymity Requirements for all submissions   
  Research track submissions are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.  
 Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in | (Snodgrass 2007) | : authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process. 
  PC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the submission will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following: Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the submission. 
  Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. 
  Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. 
  The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the submission. 
  Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors' names in the submission's associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. 
   
 To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to SIGMOD.  
 You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:  
 In our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, "A Simple Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, "A More Complicated Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   
 The solution is to reference one's past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity:  
 In previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, "A Simple Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, "A More Complicated Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   
 Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.  
 Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.  
 It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.  
 No exceptions will be made to the double anonymity requirement for Research Track papers. If the authors of a submission feel that double anonymity needs to be violated, for example to reveal the identity of a system, they may consider submission to a SIGMOD track that does not impose a double anonymity requirement, such as the Industry Track.  
 Artifacts and Reproducibility   
  SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Please include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For all Research Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:  
 <meta name="robots" content="noindex">   
 We recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within one week from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.  
 In the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case.

 Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues  
 The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment  . Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.  
 For more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/   
 Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.  
 Inclusion  
 Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:  
  
 Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:   
 Implicit assumption: | An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents. 
  Oppressive terminology: | Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in | this article | . 
  Marginalization of URGs: | An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities. 
  Lack of accessibility: | Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple 
  Stereotyping: | Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles. 
   
 Diversity  
 Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.  
 Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:   
 Embracing different cultures: | Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., | this article | on names across different cultures. 
  Embracing differences in figures: | Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people. 
  Embracing gender diversity in pronouns: | Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles. 
   
 Responsibility  
 Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article  discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article  also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.

 Abstract  
   
 This year’s theme of the conference is the use of Enterprise Modeling and Enterprise Architecture for system analysis and design to support industry 5.0 and society 5.0. At the core of fulfilling these visions are adoptions of a human-centric approach for digital technologies, up-skilling and reskilling European workers, modern, resource-efficient and sustainable industries and transition to a circular economy, as well as, a globally competitive and world-leading industry, speeding up investment in research and innovation. All of these challenges need support for congruence between business and information technology. Enterprise Modeling and Enterprise Architecture are well positioned to support this by providing methods and tools for system development, as well as investigating and reporting on the current state-of-research and state-of-practice.

 Capability Management in Digital Enterprises   
 January 2018    
 Janis Stirna 
  Kurt Sandkuhl 
  Putting capability management into practice requires both a solid theoretical foundation and realistic approaches. This book introduces a development methodology that integrates business and information system development and run-time adjustment based on the concept of capability by presenting the main findings of the CaaS project – the Capability-Driven Development (CDD) methodology, the ... [Show full abstract]  architecture and components of the CDD environment, examples of real-world applications of CDD, and aspects of CDD usage for creating business value and new opportunities. Capability thinking characterizes an organizational mindset, putting capabilities at the center of the business model and information systems development. It is expected to help organizations and in particular digital enterprises to increase flexibility and agility in adapting to changes in their economic and regulatory environments. Capability management denotes the principles of how capability thinking should be implemented in an organization and the organizational means. This book is intended for anyone who wants to explore the opportunities for developing and managing context-dependent business capabilities and the supporting business services. It does not require a detailed understanding of specific development methods and tools, although some background knowledge and experience in information system development is advisable. The individual chapters have been written by leading researchers in the field of information systems development, enterprise modeling and capability management, as well as practitioners and industrial experts from these fields.

  Janis Grabis 
  The notion of capability has been gaining a growing attention in the business and information system (IS) engineering community due to a number of reasons: it facilitates focus on business investments, it can be used as a baseline for business planning, and it directly leads to service specification and design. It is not however widely known to what extent capability is considered in different ... [Show full abstract]  modeling approaches, how it is defined, and what purpose it fulfills. This article analyzes how the notion of capability is included in the frameworks spanning from business-oriented such as Business Architecture and Business Value Modeling, to the alignment-oriented represented by Enterprise Architecture (EA), and Enterprise Modeling (EM). The results of the analysis have shown that capability has widespread presence in the frameworks and that its conceptual meaning is largely similar, while the intentions and the mechanisms of its use differ, which raises stimulating opportunities for new contributions and improvements in the field.

  1. SCHOLAT Social Network [Download]   
 Community is the implicit structure in social networks. In academic social networks, the users with similar or same research interests are more likely to be in the same community with close links and similar attributes. Effective community detection results can be further utilized for user analytics and user recommendation.  
 This dataset aims to fuse user links and attributes for community detection. The dataset mainly consists of three parts where contains 16,007 users and 202,248 links. (1) "attribute" directory contains 16,007 files which are user attributes with the user IDs as file names. (2) "links.txt" contains 202,248 lines and each line means that there exists one link (friendship, team members in the same research teams, or classmates in the same courses) between two users (represented as IDs) which are split by TAB. (3) "lexicons.txt" contains 25,817 words with 15,790 Chinese words and 10,027 English words, which constitutes all the user attributes.  
 BTW, the last version of this dataset has been successfully applied for the first ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (1 st  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 15 th  Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2020). View the details on https://www.scholat.com/confweb/CCSCW2020/big_data_competiton.jsp  . The difference between this version and the last version on ChineseCSCW Cup is that we extend more user links.

 2. SCHOLAT Link Prediction [Download]   
 Link prediction is an important research problem in academic social network analysis. It mines possible relationships among scholars by using existing network structure and external information. An effective link prediction method can support many personalized applications of academic social networks, including recommendation of scholars' friends/followers, completion/prediction of scholars' collaborative relationship, and recommendation of academic resources.  
 This dataset mainly contains the user attributes and links among 10,755 users from SCHOLAT. The "attribute" directory contains 10,755 files which are user attributes with the user IDs as file names. "train.csv", "dev.csv" and "test.csv" are 168540, 16854 and 16854 undirected edges respectively with the 2-column user nodes.  
 This dataset will be used for the second ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (2 nd  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 16th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2021).

 3. Anomaly Detection on Attributed Network [Download]   
 Anomaly detection on attributed networks is an important task in social network analysis. The goal is to find the anomalies that deviate significantly from the majority of the network in terms of some proximities, e.g. topological structure or attribute proximity. An effective anomaly detection can support many applications such as web spam detection, system fraud detection, network intrusion detection and representation learning.  
 This dataset is adopted for simultaneously detecting structure/attribute-abnormal nodes and motif instances. The nodes represent the scholars and the edges denote the message interactions between the two ending nodes. The breadth first search with random restart is used to craw the nodes. And the nodes of degree no larger than 50 are preserved. The node attribute vectors are extracted by means of applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the brief biographies of the corresponding scholars. After preprocessing and subset selection, the SCHOLAT dataset contains 2,022 nodes, 2,500 edges and 329 triangle motif instances. The dimension of the node attribute vectors is 500. The number of the motif-augmented edges is 8,361.

 4. User-Generated Item Recommendation [Download]   
 Most of the existing recommendation methods assume that all the items are provided by separate producers, which is however not true in some recommendation tasks. That is, it is possible that some of the items are generated by users. Appropriately considering the user-item generation relation may bring benefit to some recommender systems, e.g., implicit recommender systems with only implicit user-item interactions.  
 In our paper in Knowledge-Based Systems 2022, we have proposed a new method called Deep Interaction-Attribute-Generation (DIAG) model, which integrates the user-item interaction relation, the user-item generation relation and the item attribute information into one deep learning framework. And we have collected two datasets, namely Scholat and Lizhi.  
 The Scholat dataset is a post recommendation dataset obtained from the scholar social network https://www.scholat.com/  . The scholars are taken as users and the posts are taken as items. Each post is generated by at most one scholar (i.e. user-item generation) and will be read by many scholars (i.e. user-item interaction). The item attribute vector is obtained by applying word2vec to the 0/1-valued word vector representing the absence/presence of each word in the title and content of the post. The dimension of the item attribute vector is 372. Only the users with no less than 2 interactions are preserved. After preprocessing, a subset consisting of 1991 users and 5008 items is obtained. The number of user-item interactions is 13960. The number of user-item generations is 3776.  
 The Lizhi dataset is an audio recommendation dataset obtained from the online audio platform https://www.lizhi.fm  . The normal users are taken as users and the audios are taken as items. Each audio is generated by at most one user (i.e. user-item generation) and will be listened to by many users (i.e. user-item interaction). The item attribute vector characterizes the key information of the audio, namely the gender and age of the user generating this audio, and the bag of words (BOW) representation of the tags of the audio. The dimension of the item attribute vectors is 514. Only users with at least 10 user-item interactions are preserved. After preprocessing, a subset consisting of 3716 users and 9205 items is obtained. The number of user-item interactions is 858124. The number of user-item generations is 5744.

 5. SCHOLAT Interactive User Recommendation [Download]   
 Interactive recommender systems (IRS) have attracted more and more attention in recent years, which can receive user feedbacks on the recommendation list and constantly improve the recommendation results. This dataset contains 39,805 users and 680,267 historical interactions among them from SCHOLAT. The "user_attribute" directory contains 39,805 files which are user attributes with the user IDs (from 0 to 39,804) as file names. The user attributes are extracted from their biography in SCHOLAT and most of them are in Chinese. The file "user_interactions.txt" contains all the user interactions that are in the format as "User1::User2::Reward::Timestamp", where "User1" is the ID of user1, "User2" is the ID of user2, "Reward" represents the feedback or rating on user2 by user1, and "Timestamp" is the time at which this interaction happened. More specifically, if user1 clicks or browses user2's homepage, the reward is set as 1. If user1 follows user2, the reward is set as 3. If user1 unfollows user2, the reward is -1.

 6. SCHOLAT Multiplex Network [Download]   
 The SCHOLAT Multiplex Network provides a comprehensive list of social information. In this network, we construct a multiplex structure with three layers: (1) The first layer represents connections between users who become friends. (2) The second layer represents connections between users who join the same groups. (3) The third layer represents connections between users who study the same courses. Furthermore, we define an individual ground-truth community based on the affiliation of users. All layers consist of the same 2,302 nodes with the highest quality. Each layer has a specific number of edges: 11,393 for the first layer, 139,004 for the second layer, and 70,226 for the third layer. We have divided these nodes into 11 communities.  
 This dataset will also be used for the fourth ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (4 th  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 18th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2023).  
  
  7. SCHOLAT ScholarNet [Download]   
 This dataset contains the user attributes and links among 9,537 users from SCHOLAT. The "attributes" directory contains 9,537 user attribute files with the user IDs as file names. The links data is divided into two parts: "train.csv" and "test.csv", which respectively include 128,924 and 32,231 undirected edges.  
 This dataset will be used for the fifth ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (5 th  CCSCW Cup) on the 19th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2024).

 PODS  

  PODS, the Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, is the premier international conference on the theoretical aspects of database systems. PODS started in 1982. It is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD). Since 1991, PODS has been held jointly with the SIGMOD conference, combining the full spectrum of database research, from the most abstract and fundamental to the most pragmatic. A single registration gives attendees access to both PODS and SIGMOD sessions and copies of both proceedings.  
 PODS papers are distinguished by a rigorous approach to widely diverse problems in databases, often bringing to bear techniques from such fields as computational logic, finite model theory, complexity theory, algorithm and data structure design and analysis, and many others. In addition to approximately 25 research papers selected from a large number of submissions, the conference includes invited tutorials and keynote talks.

 POPL 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one used for POPL 2023 and 2024 but different from the lightweight double-blind process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.  
 Submissions:  Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  Supplementary material:  Authors are permitted to provide supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. 
  Author response:  In responding to reviews, authors should not say anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process. 
  Dissemination of work under submission:  Authors are welcome to disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the community. 
  The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.  
 However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair  to discuss the situation and how to handle it.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  addresses many common scenarios and answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Evaluation Process   
 Like last year, POPL 2025 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized supplementary material; only anonymized supplementary material may be submitted.  
 POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2025, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl25.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 11, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper submissions:  
 Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart  LaTeX class with acmsmall  option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  , and further information about PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines page  . PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word. 
  We strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options in order to make submissions easier to review. 
  ( NEW this year  ) Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be either author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric. 
  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. 
  Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. 
  Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their submissions, but it must be fully anonymized. 
  Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form. 
  Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information. 
  If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence. 
  Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a higher standard. 
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged (but not required) to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Why are you using full  double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight  double-blind reviewing?   
 A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review (double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity, and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: We discourage the use of external links, but sometimes the most convenient way to share suplementary material such as code or datasets is to include a link to a github repository or a google drive, but it is very important that they are fully anonymized. In particular, a link to your working code repository that exposes the identities of the contributors will be in violation of the double blind policy.  
 The same holds for online demos; reviewers should be able to visit the online demo and potentially browse its source code without being exposed to the identity of the authors (watch out for copyright statements, for example).  
 You should keep in mind that reviewers are under no obligation to review any supplementary material, including externally linked data or code, and reviewers may chose not to visit any externally linked material.  
 Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to a public repository or an online demo would constitute a breach of academic integrity.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper, then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication (e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development of previous papers but which was never properly described in those papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under the same title or a different title – has been presented at an informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous conference or workshop. 
  Post your submission on your home page, your institutional repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever title you want). 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC members with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or job interviews during the POPL review period. 
  The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program Chair.  
 Things you should not  do:  
 Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your work. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks. Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.  
 That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: You are under no obligation to follow any URLs to external supplementary material. If the submission is not self contained and does not convince you by itself about its merits, then the paper should not be accepted. If you ever have reason to suspect that your anonymity was compromised through your following of a link, please share that information with the PC chair immediately, as this would constitute a breach of academic integrity on the part of the authors.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023  , with a few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.

   PPAM2024 OVERVIEW  
 The PPAM 2024 conference, fifteenth in a series, will cover topics in parallel and distributed processing, including theory and applications, as well as applied mathematics. The focus will be on models, algorithms, and software tools which facilitate efficient and convenient utilization of modern parallel and distributed computing architectures as well as on large-scale applications. A special attention is expected to be given to the future of computing beyond Moore's Law, and AI/ML approaches in high performance computing.  
 PPAM is a biennial conference started in 1994, with the proceedings published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences series. The PPAM Proceedings are indexed in main databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and DBLP.  
 PPAM 2024 is expected to be an in-person conference with the possibility of remote participation. However, we strongly encourage in-person participation, as PPAM also has very compelling networking aspects and a social and cultural program.  
 The organizers will provide shuttles between Krakow airport and conference hotels in Ostrava.
