  Request for Proposals – IJCB 2025 

 The IEEE Biometrics Council and IAPR TC-4 invite proposals to host the 2025 edition of the International Joint Conference on Biometrics, preferably around September-October 2025 in Asia/Australia. Proposals from other regions are welcome.  
 IEEE IJCB is the premier international forum for research in biometrics and related technologies, combining two major, the IEEE Biometrics Theory, Applications, and Systems (BTAS) conference and the International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), and is made possible through a special agreement between the by the IEEE Biometrics Council and the IAPR TC-4. IJCB is intended to have a broad scope, including advances in the fields of signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, statistical/mathematical techniques, ethical and privacy frameworks, system security, databases, and legal policy, that are relevant to biometrics.  
 The 2022 edition of IJCB was organised in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and the 2023 edition in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The conference is financially sponsored by the IEEE Biometrics Council and technically co-sponsored by IAPR TC-4.  
 Important Dates:  
 Draft proposal for initial feedback by | September 1, 2023 | . 
  Full proposals by | September 15, 2023 | . 
  Evaluation results will be returned by | October 5, 2023 | . 
  In your proposal, please include the following information:  
 Organisers: tentative general chairs, program chairs, and other key roles, with specific names where possible, proposed names otherwise. Please identify the lead general and program chairs, and describe past organisation and IJCB-related experience for all organisers. 
  The conference time, location and venue: the proposed dates, the city, the specific conference location and facilities, estimated costs of the venue, suggested hotel(s) and their cost(s), accessibility for travel and example travel costs, public transportation and access from nearest airports. If there is a local biometrics community, please mention. 
  Hybrid/virtual attendance: plans about allowing virtual participation, in case this is considered. We strongly urge you to consider a fully in-person conference. 
  Conference plans: plans for the program (technical program, special sessions, invited speakers, reception and banquet, etc.), events beyond the main conference (workshops, tutorials, tours, etc.). What is planned to be similar or different from previous IJCB conferences? 
  Budget: a tentative proposed conference budget with projections for different numbers of participants (150, 200, 250). Expected registration fees, potential sponsors, IEEE administrative expenses and contingency for unexpected expenses. 
  All communications, including request for information and bid submission, should be sent jointly to the IEEE Biometrics Council, VP Conferences (Albert Ali Salah, [email protected]     ) and to the Conference Subcommittee Chair of IAPR TC-4 (Vishal Patel, [email protected]     ).

  Paper Submission 

 Paper submission instructions and guidelines  
  
 Submit your paper at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCB2023     
 The submission system will be opened on April 2nd, 2023.  
 The LaTeX / Word templates for the paper submission are available here:  
 Latex template 
  Word template 
  Page limit:  
 A paper can be up to 8 pages including figures and tables, plus an unlimited number of additional pages for references only.  
 Supplementary:  
 Authors can submit one supplementary file. The size should not exceed 100 MB (maximum allowable by CMT)  and can be in doc, pdf or zip format.  
 Dual submission policy:  
 During the IJCB 2023 reviewing process, the paper should not be submitted to or be under review in any peer-reviewed venue  including conferences, workshops or journals. All submitted papers will be checked with a plagiarism detection tool.  
 Double-blind review policy:  
 The reviewing process will be double blind.  
 Remove author names, affiliations, email addresses, etc. from the paper. 
  Remove personal acknowledgments. 
  When reporting experiments on data collected in your lab, consider stating this as “This experiment was conducted using data acquired at Mars University”. Do not state this as “This experiment was conducted using data that was collected in our labs at Mars University”. 
  When citing your own work, ensure that the narrative does not divulge your identity. 
  Simultaneous submissions to arxiv | without mentioning IJCB | are allowed. 
  Dataset requirement:  
 For existing public datasets, the authors are strongly encouraged to state if they are still available for others to reproduce experimental results.  
 For new datasets introduced in the submission involving human subjects, the authors are strongly suggested to ensure the datasets have been ethically, legitimately and legally acquired and stored. Any approvals already obtained from an Institutional Review Board (IRB, or equivalent) are more than enough to demonstrate this, and it is encouraged to state such approvals in the paper. However, please do not submit your approval files in the submission since this may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. A sentence stating the approvals, or a paragraph demonstrating your ethical considerations in collecting the dataset, in either the main paper or the supplementary material, is enough. Besides, it is strongly encouraged that the new datasets will be made available to others to contribute to the biometrics research community and allow reproducibility.  
 For private datasets, either existing or new, are allowed for experiments. However, for dataset papers claiming new dataset contributions, the dataset must be made publicly available by the camera-ready deadline; otherwise the claim of new dataset contributions will not be counted by reviewers.  
 Conflict of interest:  
 Papers co-authored by General or Program Chairs will be reviewed with Chair-conflicts enabled in the reviewing platform to avoid any conflict of interest.  
 Registration and presentation requirement:  
 Papers accepted at the conference must be presented by one of the authors, and at least one of the authors must register at the standard registration rate before the early registration deadline. Each author registration applies towards only one paper. If an accepted paper is not registered and/or not presented at the conference, it will be withdrawn from the proceedings and from IEEE Xplore. IJCB2023 reserves the right to exclude a paper from publication if the paper is not presented (no-show) at the conference.  
 Authors may not delegate presentation of their paper to a non-author in attendance.  
 Authors are required by IEEE to transfer copyrights for any papers placed in Xplore. This is performed at the time final versions are submitted for production. If a paper is withdrawn from the proceedings, copyright will revert to the authors.

 Research  

 The main focus of the BioML lab is the development and enhancement of biometric recognition systems. We work with different biometric modalities  , such as face, iris, fingerprint, finger vein, or handwritten signatures, as well as with combinations of those in multi-biometric  schemes. Besides trying to increase the recognition accuracy and computational efficiency of the systems, we focus on other relevant aspects of this research area. Preserving the privacy  of the subjects is at the core of our research, for which we develop biometric template protection schemes in compliance with the GDPR and relevant ISO standards, following the Privacy-by-Design principle. Furthermore, the detection of several forms of attacks  on biometric systems (e.g., Presentation Attacks or Morphing Attacks) is key to increasing the security and reliability of the systems. Last but not least, we believe that higher explainability  and transparency  will allow further acceptance and deployment of biometric recognition.  
 A deep understanding of machine learning  methods and cryptographic primitives  allows us to pursue our research goals.  
 Our group co-organises and participates in international academic conferences such as IJCB and BIOSIG  , and contributes both to the European Association for Biometrics (EAB)  and the international standardisation in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC37  .

  Rough Sets and Current Trends in Soft Computing 

 Before the advent of fuzzy and rough sets, some authors in the 1960s studied three-valued logics and pairs of sets with a meaning similar to those we can encounter nowadays in modern theories such as rough sets, decision theory and granular computing. We revise these studies using the modern terminology and making reference to the present literature. Finally, we put forward some future directions of investigation.   

 General Negations for Residuated Fuzzy Logics    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.13-22 

 Involutive residuated negations are usually considered in resi\-duated fuzzy logics and they are also based on continuous triangular norms. This paper introduces a generalization of these negations using flexible conjunctors, several properties of them and the corresponding disjunctive dual operators associated with the conjunctor.   

 Improving the β-Precision and OWA Based Fuzzy Rough Set Models: Definitions, Properties and Robustness Analysis    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.23-34 

 Since the early 1990s, many authors have studied fuzzy rough set models and their application in machine learning and data reduction. In this work, we adjust the β-precision and the ordered weighted average based fuzzy rough set models in such a way that the number of theoretical properties increases. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of the new models a-β-PREC and a-OWA to noisy data and compare them to a general implicator-conjunctor-based fuzzy rough set model.   

 Nearest Neighbour-Based Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.35-46 

 Research in the area of fuzzy-rough set theory and its application to various areas of learning have generated great interest in recent years. In particular, there has been much work in the area of feature or attribute selection. Indeed, as the number of dimensions increases, the number of data objects required in order to generate accurate models increases exponentially. Thus, feature selection (FS) has become an increasingly necessary step in model learning. The use of fuzzy-rough sets as dataset pre-processors offers much in the way of flexibility, however the underlying complexity of the subset evaluation metric often presents a problem and can result in a great deal of potentially unnecessary computational effort. This paper proposes two different novel ways to address this problem using a neighbourhood approximation step in order to alleviate the processing overhead and reduce the complexity of the evaluation metric. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that much computational effort can be avoided, and as a result the efficiency of the FS process can be improved considerably.   

 Some Fundamental Laws of Partial First-Order Logic Based on Set Approximations    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  RSCTC 2014 

 The authors show that a very general framework of set approximation can be the set-theoretical base of semantics of a partial first-order logic. The most general problem is what happens if in the semantics of first-order logic one uses the approximations of sets as semantic values of predicate parameters instead of sets given by their total interpretation in order to determine the truth values of formulas? The authors show some unexpected properties connected with logical constants directly. The goal of the investigation is to show the possible connections between the result of different approximative and exact evaluation of formulas – or the lack of them. At the end, the authors present the practical example, in which we can see the discussed behavior of approximation.

 Aristotle’s Syllogisms in Logical Semantics Relying on Optimistic, Average and Pessimistic Membership Functions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  RSCTC 2014 

 After giving the precise partial first-order logical semantics relying on different membership functions, the notion of decision driven consequence relations with parameters is introduced. Aristotle’s valid syllogisms of the first figure are investigated. The author shows what kind of decisions is necessary and how parameters have to be chosen in order that a consequence relation remains valid.

 Fuzzy Sets for a Declarative Description of Multi-adjoint Logic Programming    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.71-82 

 A powerful research line in the design of declarative languages consists in the introduction of expressive resources with a fuzzy taste on their cores, in order to provide comfortable computational constructs for easily solving real-world scientific/engineering problems. Into the fuzzy logic programming arena, the so-called multi-adjoint approach (MALP in brief) has emerged as an interesting paradigm for which our research group has developed during the last years the \(\mathcal F \mathcal L \mathcal O \mathcal P \mathcal E \mathcal R\) programming environment and the FuzzyXPath application in the field of the semantic web. Since the practicality of declarative languages is strongly dependent of their theoretical foundations, here we focus on topics related with the declarative semantics of the MALP framework. So, under an innovative point of view relying on fuzzy sets theory, in this paper we re-formulate in a very simple and elegant way our original model theory-based notions of least fuzzy Herbrand model and (fuzzy) correct answer. Apart for simplifying the proofs relating these concepts, our results are nicely strengthened with homologous ones in the field of pure logic programming, but largely surpassing them thanks to the fuzzy dimension of the MALP language.   

 Multi Threshold FRPS: A New Approach to Fuzzy Rough Set Prototype Selection    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.83-91 

 Prototype Selection (PS) is the preprocessing technique for K nearest neighbor classification that selects a subset of instances before classification takes place. The most accurate state-of-the-art PS method is Fuzzy Rough Prototype Selection (FRPS), which assesses the quality of the instances by means of the fuzzy rough positive region and automatically selects a good threshold to decide if instances should be retained in the prototype subset. In this paper we introduce a new PS method based on FRPS, called Multi Threshold FRPS (MT-FRPS) . Instead of determining one threshold against which the quality of every instance is compared, we consider one threshold for each class. We evaluate MT-FRPS on 40 standard classification datasets and compare it against MT-FRPS and the state-of-the-art PS methods and show that MT-FRPS improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art PS methods.   

 Measurable Structures of ${\cal I}$ -Fuzzy Rough Sets    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.92-99 

 In this paper, dual fuzzy rough approximation operators determined by a fuzzy implication operator \({\cal I}\) in infinite universes of discourse are first introduced. Measurable structures of \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough sets are then discussed. It is shown that the family of all definable sets in an \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough set algebra derived from a reflexive fuzzy space forms a σ-fuzzy algebra. In a finite universe of discourse, the family of all definable sets in a serial \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough set algebra is a fuzzy algebra, and conversely if a σ-fuzzy algebra is generated by a crisp algebra, then there must exist an \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough set algebra such that the family of all definable sets is exactly the given σ-fuzzy algebra.   

 Multi-label Attribute Evaluation Based on Fuzzy Rough Sets    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.100-108 

 In multi-label learning task, each sample may be assigned with one or more labels. Moreover multi-label classification tasks are often characterized by high-dimensional and inconsistent attributes. Fuzzy rough sets are an effective mathematic tool for dealing with inconsistency and attribute reduction. In this work, we discuss multi-label attribute reduction within the frame of fuzzy rough sets. We analyze the definitions of fuzzy lower approximation in multi-label classification and give several improvements of the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, the attribute dependency function is defined to evaluate condition attributes. A multi-label attribute reduction algorithm is constructed based on the dependency function. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.   

 Mining Significant Granular Association Rules for Diverse Recommendation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.120-127 

 Granular association rule is a new technique to build recommender systems. The quality of a rule is often evaluated by the confidence measure, namely the probability that users purchase or rate certain items. Unfortunately, the confidence-based approach tends to suggest popular items to users, and novel patterns are often ignored. In this paper, we propose to mine significant granular association rules for diverse and novel recommendation. Generally, a rule is significant if the recommended items favor respective users more than others; while a recommender is diverse if it recommends different items to different users. We define two sets of measures to evaluate the quality of a rule as well as a recommender. Then we propose a significance-based approach seeking top-k significant rules for each user. Results on the MovieLens dataset show that the new approach provides more significant and diverse recommendations than the confidence-based one.   

 Incremental Three-Way Decisions with Incomplete Information    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.128-135 

 The theory of rough sets proposed a framework for approximating concepts by three pair-wise disjoint regions, namely, the positive, boundary and negative regions. Rules generated by the three regions form three-way decision rules, which are acceptance, deferment and rejection decisions. The periodic updating of decision rules is required due to the dynamic nature of decision systems. Incremental learning technique is an effective way to solve the problem of dynamic data, which is capable of updating the learning results incrementally without recalculation in the total data set from scratch. In this paper, we present a methodology for incremental updating three-way decisions with incomplete information when the object set varies through the time.   

 On Determination of Thresholds in Three-Way Approximation of Many-Valued NM-Logic    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.136-143 

 Approximation of a many-valued logic by a logic with less number of truth values is an important topic. Three-way approximation based on a pair of thresholds is an example considered by Yao. However, the determination of thresholds has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we aim to study this issue in the context of many-valued NM-logic with the standard valuation domain \({\{0,\frac{1}{n-1},\frac{2}{n-1},\cdots,\frac{n-2}{n-1},1\}}\). The main result is that when n is odd, the thresholds for three-way decision is uniquely determined. When n is even, there is actually no three-way decision, but two-way decision.

 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.144-151 

 Decision-theoretic rough set is a special rough set approach, which includes both misclassification and delayed decision costs. Though the property of monotonicity does not always hold in decision-theoretic rough set, the decision-monotonicity reduct may help us to increase both lower approximation and upper approximation. The experimental results in this paper tell us that by comparing with the original decision system, more cost is required with decision-monotonicity reduct. The implied philosophy is: if you want to get more, you should pay more!   

 An Incremental Clustering Approach Based on Three-Way Decisions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.152-159 

 Most of the clustering algorithms reported assume a data set does not always change. However, it is often observed that the analyzed data set changes over time. To combat changes, we introduce a new incremental soft clustering approach based on three-way decisions theory in this paper. Firstly, an initial clustering algorithm is proposed by using representative points. Secondly, to eliminate the influence of the processing order on final incremental clustering results, the incremental data is pre-clustered the same way. To quickly search similar areas for incremental data, a searching tree based on the representative points is constructed, and the strategies of searching and updating are presented. Finally, the three-way decisions strategy is used for incremental clustering. The results of the example analysis show the approach is effective to incremental clustering.   

 Determining Three-Way Decision Regions with Gini Coefficients    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  2014 International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.160-171 

 Three-way decision rules can be constructed from rough set regions, i.e., positive, negative and boundary regions. These rough set regions can be viewed as the acceptance, rejection, and non-commitment decision regions in three-way classification. Interpretation and determination of decision regions are one of the key issues of three-way decision and rough set theories. We investigate the relationship between changes in rough set regions and their impacts on the Gini coefficients of decision regions. Effective decision regions can be obtained by satisfying objective functions of Gini coefficients of decision regions. Three different objective functions are discussed in this paper. The example shows that effective decision regions can be obtained by tuning Gini coefficients of decision regions to satisfy a certain objective function. It is suggested that with the new approach more applicable decision regions and decision rules may be obtained.   

 Cost-Sensitive Three-Way Decisions Model Based on CCA    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.172-180 

 The concept of three-way decisions was proposed by Yao and most of three-way decisions models use two thresholds α and β to partition the universe into three parts: the positive region POS(X), the negative region NEG(X) and the boundary region BND(X). But acquirement of a pair of thresholds is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new method to get the thresholds of three-way decisions model. We introduce loss function into three-way decisions model based on constructive covering algorithm (CCA). A loss function is interpreted as the costs of making classification decisions. More specifically, for reducing losses of classification, we change the radius of the cover according to the loss function, then we compute the thresholds based on the modification. This paper propose an effective method to compute thresholds α and β, which is according to cost-sensitive three-way decisions model based on CCA.   

 Feature Selection Based on Confirmation-Theoretic Rough Sets    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  RSCTC 2014 
  pp.181-188 

 As an important part of data preprocessing in machine learning and data mining, feature selection, also known as attribute reduction in rough set theory, is the process of choosing the most informative subset of features. Rough set theory has been used as such a tool with much success. The main objective of this paper is to propose a feature selection procedure based on a special group of probabilistic rough set models, called confirmation-theoretic rough set model(CTRS). Different from the existing attribute reduction methods, the definition of positive features is based on Bayesian confirmation measures. The proposed method is further divided into two categories based on the qualitative and quantitative nature of the underlying rough set models. This study provides new insights into the problem of attribute reduction.   

 Fuzzy-Attributes and a Method to Reduce Concept Lattices    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.189-200 

 Reducing the size of the concept lattices is a fundamental problem in formal concept analysis. This paper presents several properties of useful fuzzy-attributes, in the general case of multi-adjoint concept lattices. Moreover, the use of these fuzzy-attributes provides a mechanism to reduce the size of concept lattices considering a subset of the original one and, therefore, without losing and modifying important information.   

 Monadic Formal Concept Analysis    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.201-210 

 Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as inherently relational can be formalized and generalized by using categorical constructions. This provides a categorical view of the relation between “object” and “attributes”, which can be further extended to a more generalized view on relations as morphisms in Kleisli categories of suitable monads. Structure of sets of “objects” and “attributes” can be provided e.g. by term monads over particular signatures, and specific signatures drawn from and developed within social and health care can be used to illuminate the use of the categorical approach.   

 On Adjunctions between Fuzzy Preordered Sets: Necessary Conditions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.211-221 

 There exists a direct relation between fuzzy rough sets and fuzzy preorders. On the other hand, it is well known the existing parallelism between Formal Concept Analysis and Rough Set Theory. In both cases, Galois connections play a central role. In this work, we focus on adjunctions (also named isotone Galois connections) between fuzzy preordered sets; specifically, we study necessary conditions that have to be fulfilled in order such an adjunction to exist.   

 A New Consensus Tool in Digital Libraries    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.222-231 

 Libraries represent a focal point of academic life and as such serve also a societal purpose of bringing together people around common themes. This purpose is nowadays enhanced and facilitated by the so-called digital libraries. For this reason, it is necessary to develop tools for helping users to reach decision with a high level of conensus in these virtual environments. The aim of this contribution is to present a tool for reaching consensus in order to minimize the main problems that these virtual environments presents (difficulty of establishing trust relations, low and intermittent participation rates, and so on) while incorporating the the benefits that they offers (rich and diverse knowledge due to a large number of users, real-time comunication, and so on). To do so, the fuzzy linguistic modelling is used to represent the users’ opinions.   

 An Implementation of a Linguistic Multi-Criteria Decision Making Model: An Application to Tourism    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.232-239 

 In tourism there are attempts to standardize the service quality evaluation, such as the SERVQUAL instrument, which is a five-item scale consisting of: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. However, this scale is not commonly used in the most popular tourism websites. In this context, we present an implementation, using IBM SPSS Modeler, of a linguistic multi-criteria decision making model to integrate the hotel guests’ opinions included in the WWW and expressed on other dimensions (or attributes) in order to obtain a SERVQUAL scale evaluation value of service quality. As a particular case study, we show an application example using TripAdvisor website.   

 Integration of Dependent Features on Sensory Evaluation Processes    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.240-249 

 The aim of a sensory evaluation process is to compute the global value of each evaluated product by means of an evaluator set, according to a set of sensory features. Several sensory evaluation models have been proposed which use classical aggregation operators to summary the sensory information, assuming independent sensory features, i.e, there is not interaction among them. However, the sensory information is perceived by the set of human senses and, depending on the evaluated product, its sensory features may be dependent and present interaction among them. In this contribution, we present the integration of dependent sensory features in sensory evaluation processes. To do so, we propose the use of the fuzzy measure in conjunction with the Choquet integral to deal with this dependence, extending a sensory evaluation model proposed in the literature. This sensory evaluation model has the advantage that offers linguistic terms to handle the uncertainty and imprecision involved in evaluation sensory processes. Finally, an illustrative example of a sensory evaluation process with dependent sensory features is shown.

 Low back pain affects a large proportion of the adult population at some point in their lives and has a major economic and social impact. To soften this impact, one possible solution is to make use of recommender systems, which have already been introduced in several health fields. In this paper, we present TPLUFIB-WEB, a novel fuzzy linguistic Web system that uses a recommender system to provide personalized exercises to patients with low back pain problems and to offer recommendations for their prevention. This system may be useful to reduce the economic impact of low back pain, help professionals to assist patients, and inform users on low back pain prevention measures. A strong part of TPLUFIB-WEB is that it satisfies the Web quality standards proposed by the Health On the Net Foundation (HON), Official College of Physicians of Barcelona, and Health Quality Agency of the Andalusian Regional Government, endorsing the health information provided and warranting the trust of users.   

 On Distances for Cooperative Games and Non-additive Measures with Communication Situations    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.262-269 

 Non-additive (fuzzy) measures also known as cooperative games or capacities are set functions that can be used to evaluate subsets of a reference set. In order to evaluate their similarities and differences, we can consider distances between pairs of measures. Games have been extended to communication situations in which besides of the game there is a graph that establishes which sets are feasible (which coalitions are possible, which individuals can cooperate). In this paper we consider the problem of defining a distance for pairs of measures when not all sets are feasible.   

 TSK-0 Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems for High-Dimensional Problems Using the Apriori Principle for Rule Generation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.270-279 

 Algorithms which learn Linguistic Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems from data usually start up from the definition of the linguistic variables, generate a set of candidate rules and, afterwards, search a subset of them through a metaheuristic technique. In high-dimensional datasets the number of candidate rules is intractable, and a preselection is a must. This work adapts an existing preselection algorithm for Fuzzy Asociation Rule-Based Classification Systems to deal with TSK-0 LFRBSs. Experimental results show a good behaviour of the adaptation allowing to build precise and simple models for high-dimensional problems.

 Road accident is a disaster that vocalizes a major cause of disability, untimely death and the loss of human lives. Therefore, investigating the condition of road accidents for prediction and prevention purposes on highways is significant. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy granular decision tree to generate the road accident rules applying the discrete and continuous data stored in accident databases. Among all critical factors in the occurrence of traffic accidents, environmental factors and road design (geometry) are considered in this study. This method establishes an optimized fuzzy granular decision tree with the minimum redundancy and road accident severity classification using fuzzy reasoning. California highways were considered as the case study to examine the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is approximately 16% more accurate than the fuzzy ID3 method with less redundancy in constructing the decision tree.   

 Using Imprecise Probabilities to Extract Decision Rules via Decision Trees for Analysis of Traffic Accidents    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.288-298 

 The main aim of this study is focused on the extraction or obtaining of important decision rules (DRs) using decision trees (DTs) from traffic accidents’ data. These decision rules identify patterns related with the severity of the accident. In this work, we have incorporated a new split criterion to built decision trees in a method named Information Root Node Variation (IRNV) used for extracting these DRs. It will be shown that, with the adding of this criterion, the information obtained from the method is improved trough new and different decision rules, some of them use different variables than the ones obtained with the original method.   

 Selecting the Most Informative Inputs in Modelling Problems with Vague Data Applied to the Search of Informative Code Metrics for Continuous Assessment in Computer Science Online Courses    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.299-308 

 Sorting a set of inputs for relevance in modeling problems may be ambiguous if the data is vague. A general extension procedure is proposed in this paper that allows applying different deterministic or random feature selection algorithms to fuzzy data. This extension is based on a model of the relevance of a feature as a possibility distribution. The possibilistic relevances are ordered with the help of a fuzzy ranking. A practical problem where the most informative software metrics are searched for in an automatic grading problem is solved with this technique.   

 Classification of a Sequence of Objects with the Fuzzy Decoding Method    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.309-318 

 The problem of recognition of a sequence of objects (e.g., video-based image recognition, phoneme recognition) is explored. The generalization of the fuzzy phonetic decoding method is proposed by assuming the distribution of the classified object to be of exponential type. Its preliminary phase includes association of each model object with the fuzzy set of model classes with grades of membership defined as the confusion probabilities estimated with the Kullback-Leibler divergence between model distributions. At first, each object (e.g., frame) in a classified sequence is put in correspondence with the fuzzy set which grades are defined as the posterior probabilities. Next, this fuzzy set is intersected with the fuzzy set corresponding to the nearest neighbor. Finally, the arithmetic mean of these fuzzy intersections is assigned to the decision for the whole sequence. In this paper we propose not to limit the method’s usage with the Kullback-Leibler discrimination and to estimate the grades of membership of models and query objects based on an arbitrary distance with appropriate scale factor. The experimental results in the problem of isolated Russian vowel phonemes and words recognition for state-of-the-art measures of similarity are presented. It is shown that the correct choice of the scale parameter can significantly increase the recognition accuracy.   

 Dynamic Filtering of Ranked Answers When Evaluating Fuzzy XPath Queries    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.319-330 

 We have recently designed an extension of the XPath language which provides ranked answers to flexible queries taking profit of fuzzy variants of and, or and avg operators for XPath conditions, as well as two structural constraints, called down and deep, for which a certain degree of relevance is associated. In practice, this degree is very low for some answers weakly accomplishing with the original query, and hence, they should not be computed in order to alleviate the computational complexity of the information retrieval process. In this work we focus on the scalability of our interpreter for dealing with massive XML files by making use of its ability for prematurely disregarding those computations leading to non significant solutions (i.e., with a poor degree of relevance according the preferences expressed by users when using the new command FILTER). Since our proposal has been implemented with a fuzzy logic language, here we exploit the high expressive resources of this declarative paradigm for performing “dynamic thresholding” in a very natural and efficient way, thus connecting with the so-called top-k answering problem, which is very well-known in the fuzzy logic and soft computing arena.   

 Individual Decisions under Group Consensus    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.331-338 

 In the group decision of this paper, it is assumed that the practice is entrusted to each decision maker. In such a decision problem, it is not necessary for a decision maker to obey the group decision completely, but necessary to consider it into his/her final decision. In this paper, when a group of decision makers give the comparisons of alternatives, their individual decisions are obtained as the interval weights of alternatives so as to have a common weight. The problem is formulated based on Interval AHP. By relaxing two conditions of the individual decisions for a consensus, a decision maker has to admit the modification of his/her initial judgments and/or the enlargement of his/her individual decision.   

 Fuzzy Ontology-Based Approach for Automatic Construction of User Profiles    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing - 9th International Conference, RSCTC 2014 

 This paper shows a fuzzy ontology based approach to automatically build user profiles from a collection of user interest documents. The ontological representation of the user profile enhances the performance in tasks such as filtering, categorization and information retrieval. The proposed technique takes advantage of relevance measures to generate semantic representations of user context. The proposed work also presents a strategy for automatic generation of fuzzy ontologies to support user profile modeling. The experiments performed confirm that the automatically obtained fuzzy ontologies are good representation of the user’s preferences. In order to test the applicability of the obtained ontologies, a text categorization experiment has been proposed and the obtained results indicate that the approach can be applied with satisfactory results and warrants further research.   

 Hierarchically Structured Recommender System for Improving NPS of a Company    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.347-357 

 The paper presents a description of a hierarchically structured recommender system for improving the efficiency of a company’s growth engine. Our dataset (NPS dataset) contains answers to a set of queries (called questionnaire) sent to a randomly chosen groups of customers. It covers 34 companies called clients. The purpose of the questionnaire is to check customer satisfaction in using services of these companies which have repair shops all involved in a similar type of business (fixing heavy equipment). These shops are located in 29 states in the US and Canada. Some of the companies have their shops located in more than one state. They can compete with each other only if they target the same group of customers. The performance of a company is evaluated using the Net Promoter System (NPS). For that purpose, the data from the completed questionnaires are stored in NPS datasets. We have 34 such datasets, one for each company. Knowledge extracted from them, especially action rules and their triggers, can be used to build recommender systems giving hints to companies how to improve their NPS ratings. Larger the datasets, our believe in the knowledge extracted from them is higher. We introduce the concept of semantic similarity between companies.

Our hierarchically structured recommender system is a collection of recommender systems organized as a tree. Lower the nodes in the tree, more specialized the recommender systems are and the same the classifiers and action rules used to build their recommendation engines have higher precision and accuracy.

 Groups of learners of similar features are often created in order to diversify the environment accordingly. However student preferences may differ depending on the context of the system usage. Each new student, who intends to join the community, should obtain context-aware recommendation of the group of colleagues matching his needs. In the paper, using fuzzy logic for modeling student groups is considered. We propose to build the possibility-based representation of each group. We assume that context can be modeled by a vector of weights. Then recommendations for new students are determined taking into account a degree of possibility of matching together with the respective context parameters. We examine the presented approach by taking into account learning style dimensions as attributes which characterize student preferences. The method is evaluated on the basis of experimental results obtained for data of different groups of real students.

 Architecture and Message Protocol Proposal for Robot’s Integration in Multi-Agent Surveillance System    
   
 Conference Paper

  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.366-373 

 Nowadays, surveillance systems are less dependent of humans’ interactions, mostly in event’s detection. However, there still are tasks to be performed by humans that could be delegated to autonomous robots. The integration of an autonomous service robot, as an agent, in a multi-agent surveillance system can reduce even more humans’ dependency. This paper proposes a new architecture and a communication protocol that integrates ServRobot’s autonomous robot into DVA’s surveillance system. This integration allows the DVA’s system to use the robot as a mobile unit for validation of triggered events, to perform surveillance missions and to gather sensors information.   

 Image Coverage Segmentation Based on Soft Boundaries    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.374-381 

 This paper studies image object coverage segmentation by introducing soft boundaries. By using soft boundaries, fuzzy image can be segmented into several classes with a sharing boundary which is called a soft boundary. In this paper, several concepts of boundaries are defined, namely, hard boundary, inner boundary and outer boundary. Soft boundary is defined by the subtraction between inner boundary and outer boundary of a set. Coverage segmentation algorithm and optimization method are proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, neighbor decision rules are used in classification of pixels to filter noise or outliers. Experiments and comparison with classical coverage segmentation methods are presented, including noise test on the proposed method with four kinds of boundaries and neighbor decision rules.   

 A Modified Fuzzy Color Histogram Using Vision Perception Difference of Pixels Location    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.382-389 

 Conventional color histogram is sensitive to noisy interference such as illumination and quantization errors. Furthermore, small changes in the conventional color histogram might result great changes due to large dimension or histogram bins. This paper presents a modified fuzzy color histogram. Firstly, it considers each pixel’s color associated to all the histogram bins according to fuzzy logic and provides a histogram with single-dimension based on the CIELAB color space. Thus, it has the capacity to tolerate noisy interference and reduce computational complexity. Then, it combines the information about the location of pixels in an image to record the human vision perception variation in different spatial positions within an image. The proposed histogram is further exploit in the application of image indexing and retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed histogram is more accurate and efficient in retrieving the user-interested images.

 Sparsity promoting super-resolution coverage segmentation by linear unmixing in presence of blur and noise

 We present a segmentation method that estimates the relative coverage of each pixel in a sensed image by each image component. The proposed super-resolution blur-aware model (utilizes a priori knowledge of the image blur) for linear unmixing of image intensities relies on a sparsity promoting approach expressed by two main requirements: (i) minimization of Huberized total variation, providing smooth object boundaries and noise removal, and (ii) minimization of nonedge image fuzziness, responding to an assumption that imaged objects are crisp and that fuzziness is mainly due to the imaging and digitization process. Edge fuzziness due to partial coverage is allowed, enabling subpixel precise feature estimates. The segmentation is formulated as an energy minimization problem and solved by the spectral projected gradient method, utilizing a graduated nonconvexity scheme. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on synthetic and real multichannel images confirms good performance, particularly relevant when subpixel precision in segmentation and subsequent analysis is a requirement.

  I think that the first time I heard a talk on fuzzy sets was at one of the early International Symposiums on Multiple-valued Logic, (ISMVL), and the speaker was Prof. Lotfi A. Zadeh. Of course, I felt that the message was very interesting, but at that time, I was fully concentrated on multiple-valued switching theory, where by definition, everything was precise and crisp, i.e., as far from ... [Show full abstract]  fuzziness as only possible. Things however were meant to change. A few years later, (in 1980) at the International Symposium on Multiple-valued Logic, in Evanston, Illinois, I met Prof. Enric Trillas, and that was the beginning of a deep, long lasting and “most dangerous” friendship: I started to be systematically exposed to the world of fuzzy, in a series of fuzzy related Seminars and Summer Schools organized by Prof. Trillas at different places in Spain, to which I was always invited. In one of the early Seminars he gave me as a present his recently published book on Fuzzy Sets [15]. I had no longer an excuse and I started to learn fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. When in 1986 I became a Professor at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Dortmund, Germany, I introduced for the first time at the Department, seminars on fuzzy systems, which paved the way for my later Courses on “Intelligent Systems”, (there is no accepted German equivalent for “Soft Computing”), as well as for several Master and Ph.D. Theses in the area.

  Item recommendation depends on metadata describing items as well as users through their profiles. Most currently used technologies use precise metadata because of the efficiency of the recommendation process. Nonetheless fuzzy metadata can be useful because of their ability to deal with imprecision and gradedness, two features pervading real-world applications. Fuzzy metadata can have both ... [Show full abstract]  possibilistic and veristic interpretations, which are complementary and can simultaneously occur in a recommendation context. In this paper we describe a preliminary approach to deal with this double interpretation proposing an extension of the theory of veristic variables, that is specifically suited for item recommendation. Fuzzy metadata are used to calculate the interestingness of an item for a user computing possibility and necessity measures, which enable the ranking of items. As described in the illustrative examples, this approach effectively provides for semantically significant results that are useful for item recommendation with fuzzy metadata.

[Show full abstract]  problems of creating knowledge from data, pattern recognition, making summaries, user modelling for computer/human interfaces, co-operative learning, fuzzy inheritance for associative reasoning. A voting model semantics for fuzzy sets is used to develop ideas for a mass assignment theory which provides the means of moving from the case of crisp sets to that of fuzzy sets. The use of fuzzy sets in this way will provide better interpolation, greater knowledge compression, and less dependence on the effects of noisy data than if only crisp sets were used. We will see how easy and useful it is to use successful inference methods such as decision trees, probabilistic fuzzy logic type rules, Bayesian nets with attributes taking fuzzy values rather than crisp values. The mass assignment theory provides a unified approach to handling both probabilistic uncertainty and fuzzy vagueness.

In order to store the information, a memory unit is introduced between the fuzzy inference layer and the fuzzification layer. This recurrent structure enhances the prediction capability; hence, this RNFN model can be used to develop the multistep ahead predictive controller. The objective function of model based controller (MPC) minimizes the future control moves. The gradient descent (GD) algorithm is used to the optimize control moves. The proposed RNFN model is used to develop a model predictive controller. The performance of the RNFN-MPC is compared with that of a neuro fuzzy network (NFN)–based MPC for a laboratory scale quadruple tank process.

PFCM enhances the capability of conventional FCMs to handle both randomness and fuzziness which are necessary to model the ...

A formalized inference process of PFCMs is presented for adjustments on probability of fuzzy events and for dynamic update of causal weights. This enables PFCM to synthetically analyze the impacts of randomness and fuzziness on causal inference process. The simulation result shows a good match to the above features of PFCM. PFCM, as an initial attempt, provides a heuristic approach to model the uncertainty of complex causal systems and opens a collection of interesting research issues for further research.

 Abstract  
   
 The paper presents a description of a hierarchically structured recommender system for improving the efficiency of a company’s growth engine. Our dataset (NPS dataset) contains answers to a set of queries (called questionnaire) sent to a randomly chosen groups of customers. It covers 34 companies called clients. The purpose of the questionnaire is to check customer satisfaction in using services of these companies which have repair shops all involved in a similar type of business (fixing heavy equipment). These shops are located in 29 states in the US and Canada. Some of the companies have their shops located in more than one state. They can compete with each other only if they target the same group of customers. The performance of a company is evaluated using the Net Promoter System (NPS). For that purpose, the data from the completed questionnaires are stored in NPS datasets. We have 34 such datasets, one for each company. Knowledge extracted from them, especially action rules and their triggers, can be used to build recommender systems giving hints to companies how to improve their NPS ratings. Larger the datasets, our believe in the knowledge extracted from them is higher. We introduce the concept of semantic similarity between companies. More semantically similar the companies are, the knowledge extracted from their joined NPS datasets has higher accuracy and coverage. Our hierarchically structured recommender system is a collection of recommender systems organized as a tree. Lower the nodes in the tree, more specialized the recommender systems are and the same the classifiers and action rules used to build their recommendation engines have higher precision and accuracy.

 Action Rules are rule based systems that extract actionable patterns which are hidden in big volumes of data. Users need recommendations on actions they can undertake to increase their profit or accomplish their goals, this recommendations are provided by Actionable patterns. In the technological world of big data, massive amounts of data are collected by organizations, including in major domains like financial, medical, social media and Internet of Things(IoT). To analyze and store such a massive amount of data, distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark are introduced to store the big data in a distributed fashion which manage and analyze them in parallel. The traditional Action Rules extraction models, which analyze the data in a nondistributed fashion, do not perform well when dealing larger datasets. Serious complications of discovering Action Rules with such distributed environments are - data distribution among computing nodes and calculation of major parameters including : support, confidence, utility, and coverage, that represent the whole data. Information granules form basic entities in the world of Granular Computing(GrC), which represents meaningful smaller units derived from a larger complex information system. In this research, we focus on the data distribution phase of the distributed Actionable Pattern Mining problem. To handle the data distribution task by splitting the big data in both horizontal and vertical fashions - we propose partition threshold rho. In this work, we concentrate on using information granules to implement a vertical data splitting strategy with Meta Actions. Hence our results discover valuable Actionable Knowledge with application in Business and Education domains.

 Action Rules are rule based systems for discovering actionable patterns hidden in a large dataset. Action Rules recommend actions that a user or a system can undertake to their advantage, or to accomplish their goal. Current Action Rules extraction methods are unable to process huge volumes of data in a reasonable time and it requires a distributed and parallel extraction methods. Limited research has been done on extracting Action Rules using a distributed scenario. Major complications of discovering Action Rules with such distributed systems are data distribution among computing nodes and calculation of major parameters of action rules. In this work, we propose few methods to handle the big data distribution among computation nodes using the Spark framework. With enhanced experiments made on datasets in transportation, medical, and business domains, we show our methods achieve almost equal valid results compared to results from classical non-distributed Action Rule discovery methods with improved run time.

 The paper proposes a new strategy called HAMIS to improve NPS (Net Promoter Score) of certain companies involved in heavy equipment repair in the US and Canada - we call them clients. HAMIS is based on the semantic dendrogram built by using agglomerative clustering strategy and semantic distance between clients. More similar is the knowledge extracted from two clients, more close these clients semantically are to each other. Each company is represented by a dataset which is built from answers to the questionnaire sent to a number of randomly chosen customers using services offered by this company. Before knowledge is extracted from these datasets, each one is extended by merging it with datasets which are close to it in the semantic dendrogram, have higher NPS, and if classifiers extracted from them have higher FS-score. Action rules are extracted from these extended datasets and used for providing recommendations to clients of how to improve their businesses.

 ... To achieve this goal, we intend to build a hierarchically structured recommender system driven by action rules and meta-actions. We already built a hierarchical dendrogram by applying agglomerative clustering algorithm to the semantic distance matrix covering 34 clients [6]  . Based on the dendrogram, we also proposed a strategy called Hierarchically Agglomerative Method for Improving NPS (HAMIS) to extend every client's dataset by merging it with other clients' datasets which are relatively close in the dendrogram, have better NPS, and classifiers extracted from them have higher precision and recall [7]. ...

 The paper presents one of the main modules of HAMIS recommender system built for 34 business companies (clients) involved in heavy equipment repair in the US and Canada. This module is responsible for meta-actions discovery from a large collection of comments, written as text, collected from customers about their satisfaction with services provided by each client. Meta-actions, when executed, trigger action rules discovered from customers data which are in a table format. We specifically focus on the process of mining meta-actions, which consists of four representative and characteristic steps involving sentiment analysis and text summarization. Arranging these four steps in proposed order distinguishes our work from others and better serves our purpose. Compared to procedures presented in other works, each step in our procedure is adapted accordingly with respect to our own observations and knowledge of the domain. Results obtained from the experiments prove the high effectiveness of the proposed approach for mining meta-actions.

 The paper concerns the problem of action-rule extraction when datasets are large. Such rules can be used to construct a knowledge base in a recommendation system. One of the popular approaches to construct action rules in such cases is to partition the dataset horizontally (personalization) and vertically. Different clustering strategies can be used for this purpose. Action rules extracted from vertical clusters can be combined and used as knowledge discovered from the horizontal clusters of the initial dataset. The number of extracted rules strongly depends on the methods used to complete that task. In this study, we chose a software package called SCARI recently developed by Sikora and his colleagues. It follows a rule-based strategy for action-rule extraction that requires prior extraction of classification rules and generates a relatively small number of rules in comparison to object-based strategies, which discover action rules directly from datasets. Correlation between attributes was used to cluster them. We used an agglomerative strategy to cluster attributes of a dataset and present the results by using a dendrogram. Each level of the dendrogram shows a vertical partition schema for the initial dataset. From all partitions, for each level, action rules are extracted and then concatenated. Their precision, the lightness, and the number of rules are presented and compared. Lightness shows how many action rules can be applied on average for each tuple in a dataset.

 Customer Churn Reduction Based on Action Rules and Collaboration

 Action rule mining is an important technology that can be applied to build recommender systems for reducing customer churn. Confidence, support, and coverage are used to measure the quality of action rules. In practice, action rules with higher confidence and support are more useful to users. However, there is little research work focused on improving the quality of the discovered action rules. To improve the quality of action rules extracted from a given client, this article proposes a guided (by threshold) agglomerative clustering algorithm by utilizing the knowledge extracted from semantically similar clients. The idea is to pick up only such clients that are doing better in business than the given client and are semantically similar with the given client. By doing that, the given client can follow business recommendations from the better-performing clients. The algorithm is guided by the threshold value checking how large the improvement of action rules discovered so far in their confidence is. If the improvement is lower than this threshold, the algorithm stops.

 This study was conducted to determine the dietary phenylalanine for fingerling Oreochromis niloticus by conducting an 8 weeks experiment in a flow-through system (1-1.5L/min) at 28°C water temperature. Phenylalanine requirement was determined by feeding six casein-gelatin based amino acid test diets (350 g kg– 1 CP; 16.72 kJ g–1 GE) with graded levels of phenylalanine (4, 6.5 9, 11.5, 14 and 16.5 g kg–1 dry diet) at a constant level (10 g kg–1) of dietary tyrosine to triplicate groups of fish (1.65±0.09 g) near to satiation. Absolute weight gain (AWG g fish-1), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein deposition (PD%), phenylalanine retention efficiency (PRE%) and RNA/DNA ratio was found to improve with the increasing concentrations of phenylalanine and peaked at 11.5 g kg–1 of dry diet. Quadratic regression analysis of AWG, PD and PRE against varying levels of dietary phenylalanine indicated the requirement at 12.1, 11.6, and 12.7 g kg–1 dry diet, respectively and the inclusion of phenylalanine at 12.1 g kg–1 of dry diet corresponding to 34.6 g kg–1 dietary protein is optimum for this fish. Based on above data, total aromatic amino acid requirement of fingerling O. niloticus was found to be 20.6 g kg–1 (12.1 g kg–1 phenylalanine+8.5 g kg–1 tyrosine) of dry diet, corresponding to 58.8 g kg–1 of dietary protein.

 Customer attrition is an important problem in many industries: banking, mobile service providers, insurance companies, financial service companies etc. One company from the heavy equipment repair industry within this research project expressed interest in the insight of the problem, already having their own active CRM program implemented. The goal and motivation within this topic is to determine whether there are markers in the sales trends that might suggest a customer is getting ready to defect. Observing the behavior of customers who left a company, one might be able to identify customers who might leave as well.

 As the time constraints for completing customer satisfaction surveys are becoming tighter, there emerges a need for developing a new format of surveying customers. The idea is to limit the number of score benchmark questions, and let customers express their opinions in a free format. As a result the collected data will mainly contain open-ended text comments. This chapter presents a strategy to modify the existing recommender system built based on both numerical (structured) and text data (unstructured) to work on unstructured data only to make it work with the new survey format.

 Visual techniques were used to support complex customer data analytics and illustrate concepts and data mining algorithms behind the built Recommender System. The implemented web-based visual system supports a feature analysis of 38 client companies for each year between 2011–2016 in the area of customer service (divided into shop service/field service) and parts. It serves as a visualization for the feature selection method showing the relative importance of each feature in terms of its relevance to the decision attribute—Promoter Status, and is based on an algorithm that finds minimal decision reducts. It allows the user to interactively assess the changes and implications onto predictive characteristics of the knowledge-based model. It is supported by visual additions in form of charts showing accuracy, coverage and confusion matrix of the model built on the corresponding, user-chosen dataset.

 In Search for Best Meta-Actions to Boost Businesses Revenue    
   
 Chapter

 The ultimate goal of our research is to build recommender system driven by action rules and meta-actions for providing proper suggestions to improve revenue of a group of clients (companies) involved with similar businesses. Collected data present answers from 25,000 customers concerning their personal information, general information about the service and customers’ feedback to the service. This paper proposes a strategy to classify and organize meta-actions in such a way that they can be applied most efficiently to achieve desired goal. Meta-actions are the triggers that need to be executed for activating action rules. In previous work, the method of mining meta-actions from customers’ reviews in text format has been proposed and implemented. Performed experiments have proven its high effectiveness. However, it turns out that the discovered action rules need more than one meta-action to be triggered. The way and the order of executing triggers causes new problems due to the commonness, differential benefit and applicability among sets of meta-actions. Since the applicability of meta-actions should be judged by professionals in the field, our concentration is put on designing a strategy to hierarchically sort and arrange so called meta-nodes (used to represent action rules and their triggers in a tree structure) as well as to compute the effect of each meta-node. Furthermore, users will have more concrete options to consider by following the path in trees built from these meta-nodes.

 Association Action Rules and Action Paths Triggered by Meta-actions

 Action rules are built from atomic expressions called atomic action terms and they describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another. They involve changes of values within one decision attribute. Association action rule is similar to an action rule but it may refer to changes of values involving several attributes listed in its decision part. Action paths are defined as sequences of association action rules with the assumption that the last rule in a sequence is as action rule. Early research on action rule discovery usually required the extraction of classification rules before constructing any action rule. Newest algorithms discover action rules and association action rules directly from an information system. This paper presents a strategy for generating association action rules and action paths by incorporating the use of meta-actions and influence matrices. Action paths show the cascading effect of meta-actions leading to a desired goal.

 Action rules can be seen as logical terms describing knowledge about possible actions associated with objects which is hidden in a decision system. Classical strategy for discovering them from a database requires prior extraction of classification rules which next are evaluated pair by pair with a goal to build a strategy of action based on condition features in order to get a desired effect on a decision feature. An actionable strategy is represented as a term r = [(w) Ù(a® b)] Þ [f® y]r = [(\omega) \wedge (\alpha \rightarrow \beta)] \Rightarrow [\phi \rightarrow \psi] , where ω, α, β, φ, and ψ are descriptions of objects or events. The term r states that when the fixed condition ω is satisfied and the changeable behavior (α→β) occurs in objects represented as tuples from a database so does the expectation (φ→ψ). This paper proposes a new strategy, called ARAS, for constructing action rules with the main module resembling LERS [6]. ARAS system is more simple than DEAR and its time complexity is also lower.

 An action is defined as controlling or changing some of attribute values in an information system to achieve desired result. An action reduct is a minimal set of attribute values distinguishing a favorable object from other objects. We use action reducts to formulate necessary actions. The action suggested by an action reduct induces changes of decision attribute values by changing the condition attribute values to the distinct patterns in action reducts.

 Action rules describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute. Early research on action rule discovery usually required the extraction of classification rules before constructing any action rule. Newest algorithms discover action rules directly from a decision system. To our knowledge, all these algorithms assume that all attributes are symbolic or require prior discretization of all numerical attributes. This paper presents a new approach for generating action rules from datasets with numerical attributes by incorporating a tree classifier and a pruning step based on meta-actions. Meta-actions are seen as a higher-level knowledge (provided by experts) about correlations between different attributes.

 Decision tables classifying customers into groups of different profitability are used for mining rules classifying customers. Attributes are divided into two groups: stable and flexible. By stable attributes we mean attributes which values can not be changed by a bank (age, marital status, number of children are the examples). On the other hand attributes (like percentage rate or loan approval to buy a house in certain area) which values can be changed or influenced by a bank are called flexible. Rules are extracted from a decision table given preference to flexible attributes. This new class of rules forms a special repository of rules from which new rules called actionrules are constructed. They show what actions should be taken to improve the profitability of customers.

 Action rules provide hints to a business user what actions (i.e. changes within some values of flexible attributes) should be taken to improve the profitability of customers. That is, taking some actions to re-classify some customers from less desired decision class to the more desired one. However, in previous work, each action rule was constructed from two rules, extracted earlier, defining different profitability classes. In this paper, we make a first step towards formally introducing the problem of mining action rules from scratch and present formal definitions. In contrast to previous work, our formulation provides guarantee on verifying completeness and correctness of discovered action rules. In addition to formulating the problem from an inductive learning viewpoint, we provide theoretical analysis on the complexities of the problem and its variations. Furthermore, we present efficient algorithms for mining action rules from scratch. In an experimental study we demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques.

 Mining irregular association rules based on action & non-action type data

 Conventional positive association rules are the patterns that occur frequently together. These patterns represent what decisions are routinely made based on a set of facts. Irregular association rules are the patterns that represent what decisions are rarely made based on the same set of facts. Many domains like Healthcare, Banking etc need the irregular rule to improve their system. In this paper, we propose a level wise search algorithm that works based on action and non-action type data to find irregular association rules. We have observed that irregular association rules can be discovered efficiently based on action type and non-action type data from large database. To the best of our knowledge, there is no algorithm that can determine such type of associations. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated by testing it for a real world patient data set.

 Action rules (or actionable patterns) describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute. Strategies for discovering them can be divided into two types: rule based and object based. Rule-based actionable patterns are built on the foundations of preexisting rules. This approach consists of two main steps: (1) a standard learning method is used to detect interesting patterns in the form of classification rules, association rules, or clusters; (2) the second step is to use an automatic or semiautomatic strategy to inspect such results and derive possible action strategies. These strategies provide an insight of how values of some attributes need to be changed so the desirable objects can be shifted to a desirable group. Object-based approach assumes that actionable patterns are extracted directly from a database. System DEAR, presented in this paper, is an example of a rule-based approach. System ARD and system for association rules mining are examples of an object-based approach. Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is taken as an application domain. We show how to manipulate the music score using action rules. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 The One Number you Need to Grow    
   
 Article

  HARVARD BUS REV 

 Frederick F Reichheld 
    
 Companies spend lots of time and money on complex tools to assess customer satisfaction. But they're measuring the wrong thing. The best predictor of top-line growth can usually be captured in a single survey question: Would you recommend this company to a friend? This finding is based on two years of research in which a variety of survey questions were tested by linking the responses with actual customer behavior--purchasing patterns and referrals--and ultimately with company growth. Surprisingly, the most effective question wasn't about customer satisfaction or even loyalty per se. In most of the industries studied, the percentage of customers enthusiastic enough about a company to refer it to a friend or colleague directly correlated with growth rates among competitors. Willingness to talk up a company or product to friends, family, and colleagues is one of the best indicators of loyalty because of the customer's sacrifice in making the recommendation. When customers act as references, they do more than indicate they've received good economic value from a company; they put their own reputations on the line. And they will risk their reputations only if they feel intense loyalty. The findings point to a new, simpler approach to customer research, one directly linked to a company's results. By substituting a single question--blunt tool though it may appear to be--for the complex black box of the customer satisfaction survey, companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth.

  La reconnaissance des expériences et des compétences dans le domaine de la formation est devenue un droit individuel et un facteur de régulation socioéconomique dans plusieurs pays comme la France, le Canada, la Belgique, etc. Dans cette optique, tous les individus, quelle que soit leur origine sociale, ont l’opportunité de faire valoriser leurs savoirs et connaissances afin d’obtenir soit un ... [Show full abstract]  diplôme soit des acquis crédités, par voie de reconnaissance des acquis et des compétences, à la suite des preuves justificatives de leurs expériences. C’est en ce sens que le gouvernement du Québec s’attèle à donner à chaque individu la chance de se faire connaitre, de faire valoir leurs compétences sans tenir compte de leurs caractéristiques ascriptives et adopter des dispositions légales pour faciliter des pratiques institutionnelles de reconnaissance juste et équitable. Se faire valoriser réclame la motivation et la détermination de l’individu dans la poursuite des démarches de reconnaissance : demande de justification, écriture de documents, prestation orale ; pour construire des connaissances, pour démontrer les compétences, pour obtenir des crédits, communiquer une image de soi et légitimer les expériences. Cette recherche documentaire porte sur les pratiques de reconnaissance des acquis extrascolaires des étudiants en enseignement supérieur au Québec et se déroule sur une période datant de 1986 à 2016. Elle cherche à comprendre et analyser les pratiques de reconnaissance mises en œuvre par les universités québécoises dans une perspective de justice sociale. Aussi, l’analyse englobe les politiques institutionnelles et gouvernementales, les méthodes d’évaluation ainsi que les enjeux socioculturels et sociopolitiques. Comprendre les grands enjeux sociaux de l’implantation de la reconnaissance des acquis nous semble impératif dans un contexte de mondialisation et de marchandisation de la formation. Il semble important de nous interroger sur les pratiques des établissements d’enseignement supérieur ayant pour responsabilité de former des individus pour pérenniser la société, de promouvoir la culture, encourager la tolérance et le respect d’autrui dans cette complexité sociale. Il faut se demander si les pratiques institutionnelles en matière de reconnaissance des acquis sont justes, accessibles et équitables. La mise en place de la politique de reconnaissance dans les établissements d’enseignement supérieur ne cache-t-elle pas implicitement des inégalités et de l’injustice ? La manière dont les établissements d’enseignement supérieur traitent les demandes de reconnaissance n’abrite-t-elle pas des écueils explicites ou implicites renforçant les difficultés de la plupart des étudiants ?

 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

  Conference (Montreal)  : Saturday, August 16 to Friday, August 22, 2025.  
  Satellite event (Guangzhou)  : Thursday, August 28 to Sunday, August 31, 2025.  
 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research.  
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.  
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

 Preface   
 This  v  olume  contains  the  pap  ers  selected  for  presentation  at  the  Third  Interna-   
 tional  Conference  on  Rough  Sets  and  Curren  t  T  rends  in  Computing  (RSCTC   
 2002)  held at  P  enn State  Great  V  alley  , Malv  ern, P  ennsylv  ania, U.S.A.,  14–16   
 Octob  er  2002.  Rough  set  theory  and  its  applications  constitute  a  branc  h  of   
 soft  computing  that  has  exhibited  a  signiﬁcan  t  growth  rate  during  recent  y  ears.   
 RSCTC  2002  pro  vided  a  forum  for  exchanging  ideas  among  man  y  researchers   
 in  the  rough  set  comm  unity  and  in  v  arious  areas  of  soft  computing  and  served   
 as  a  stimulus  for  mutual  understanding  and  co  op  eration.  In  recent  years,  there   
 ha  v  e  b  een  a  num  b  er  of  adv  ances  in  rough  set  theory  and  applications.  Hence,  w  e   
 ha  v  e  witnessed  a  growing  n  umber  of  international  w  orkshops  on  rough  sets  and   
 their  applications.  In  addition,  it  should  b  e  observed  that  one  of  the  beauties   
 of  rough  sets  and  the  rough  set  philosoph  y  is  that  it  tends  to  complement  and   
 reinforce  researc  h  in  many  traditional  research  areas  and  applications.  This  is   
 the  main  reason  that  man  y  in  ternational  conferences  are  no  w  including  rough   
 sets  into  the  list  of  topics.   
 It  is  our  great  pleasure  to  dedicate  this  v  olume  to  Professor  Zdzisla  w  Pa-   
 wlak,  who  created  rough  set  theory  ov  er  tw  ent  y  years  ago.  The  growth  of  rough   
 set  theory  and  applications  o  wes  a  great  deal  to  Professor  P  awlak’s  vibrant   
 en  th  usiasm  and  wit  as  well  as  his  great  generosity  to  wards  others,  esp  ecially    
 in  encouraging  and  advising  b  eginners  in  rough  sets.  The  depth,  breadth,  and   
 ric  hness  of  curren  t  rough  set  researc  h  are  directly  traceable  to  Professor  Pa  wlak’s   
 in  v  entiv  eness  and  the  richness  of  his  man  y  insigh  ts  and  ideas  concerning  data   
 mining,  machine  learning,  logic,  and  mathematics.  The  computational  features   
 of  rough  sets  are  also  giving  rise  to  new  forms  of  neuro  computing  based  on  rough   
 sets  and  to  a  family  kno  wn  as  rough  processors  for  digital  computers.  W  e  w  ould   
 also  like  to  congratulate  Professor  Pa  wlak,  who  received  an  honorary  do  ctorate   
 (Do  ctor  Honoris  Causa)  from  Pozna´  n  Polytec  hnic  Universit  y  ,  Pozna´  n,  Poland   
 on  10  April  2002.   
 W  e  wish  to  express  our  gratitude  to  Professors  Zdzisla  w  P  awlak  and  Lotﬁ  A.   
 Zadeh,  who  accepted  our  invitation  to  serv  e  as  honorary  chairs  and  to  presen  t   
 k  eynote  pap  ers  for  this  conference.  W  e  also  wish  to  thank  Professors  J.  Komoro-   
 wski,  T.Y.  Lin,  D.W.  Russell,  R.  Slowi´  nski,  and  I.B.  T  ¨  urksen  for  accepting  our   
 in  vitation  to  b  e  plenary  sp  eakers  at  RSCTC  2002.   
 The  pap  ers  contributed  to  this  v  olume  reﬂect  adv  ances  in  rough  sets  as  well

 The main purpose of this comprehensive study is to explore the major trends and challenges in machine learning and knowledge extraction. As innovation marches forward at a warp speed, machine learning, and knowledge extraction have emerged as indispensable areas that form the foundation for countless applications across numerous fields. Like many other groundbreaking innovations in today's age, the concept of machine learning was once a figment of our imaginations, confined solely to the realm of science fiction. However, its impact on real-world industries knows no boundaries, and recent advancements have opened a world where tasks are undertaken with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy, reshaping multiple sectors [1]. Machine learning, when combined with data science techniques, has evolved into an indispensable tool that optimizes our daily routines. When adequately trained, these models display phenomenal capabilities frequently surpassing human capabilities in various aspects. In the healthcare industry, for instance, machine learning algorithms can scrutinize medical images including X-rays and MRI scans with unmatched precision thereby assisting doctors in identifying diseases like cancer at an earlier stage making them more treatable[2]. In finance too these algorithms excel at spotting fraudulent transactions instantly ensuring both consumers and businesses stay protected from financial loss[2]. Such instances underline the transformative potential that lies within machine learning technology. This study will dive into the most recent milestones in machine learning algorithms, frameworks, and methodologies. Accentuating their pragmatic value and potential social influence, we look closely at the amalgamation of profound training methods such as reinforcement learning, and transfer learning techniques, systematically evaluating their role in enhancing effectiveness and boosting efficiency in machine learning systems. In addition to that, this comprehensive exploration pinpoints rising trends within the knowledge extraction arena [3]. These include natural language processing techniques along with computer vision-based ones and graph-oriented approaches. We deeply analyze how these developments are fueling new avenues of innovation within realms such as information retrieval or sentiment analysis recommendation systems among others.

 The constructive covering algorithm (CCA) has unique advantages and functions in dealing with multiple-classification problems. To better address the defects and deficiencies of the existing multi-class decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRSs) model, this paper introduces the CCA into DTRSs and constructs a multi-class DTRSs model based on the CCA. First, through the process of machine learning, this method achieves automatic multi-class clustering and effectively addresses the shortcomings of DTRSs in solving multi-class problems, namely, the large amount of computation and the impact of subjective evaluation factors on the inference of threshold values and decision rules as a result of excessive parameters. Second, by optimizing the covering centre and selecting the covering radius, the proposed method improves the efficiency of machine learning. Third, by setting up a distance parameter between covering classes, the method effectively addresses decision redundancy and conflicts when a DTRSs model is used to solve multi-class problems. Then, by organically integrating the cost sensitivity, inter-class distance parameter and class quality function and systematically re-classifying the objects in the boundary domain, it effectively solves the problem of an excessively large boundary domain. Finally, we summarize the decision-making algorithm of the multi-class DTRSs model based on the CCA and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method through experiments.

 This article describes an action rule induction Algorithm based on a sequential covering. Two variants of the Algorithm are presented. The Algorithm allows the action rule induction from a source and a target decision class point of view. The application of rule quality measures enables the induction of action rules that meet various quality criteria. The article also presents a method for recommendation induction. A recommendation indicates the actions required to move an example representing a given source class to the appropriate target class. The recommendation method is based on a set of induced action rules. The experimental part of the article presents the results of the Algorithm operation on sixteen data sets. As a result of the conducted research, the Ac-Rules package was made available.

 The Rough set theory is a very successful tool to deal with vague, inconsistent, imprecise and uncertain knowledge. In recent years, rough set theory and its applications have drawn many researchers' interest progressively in one of its hot issues, viz. the field of artificial intelligence. An intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set, which is a generalization of fuzzy set, has more practical and flexible real‐world proficiency to characterize a complex information and provide a better glimpse to confront uncertainty and ambiguity when compared with those of the fuzzy set. Moreover, rough sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets deal with the specific aspects of the same problem & imprecision, and their combination IF rough set has been studied by many researchers in the past few years. The present chapter deals with a review of IF rough set theory, their basic concepts, properties, topological structures, logic operators, approximation operators and similarity relations on the basis of axiomatic and constructive approaches. The characterization of IF rough sets based on various operators, similarity relations, distances, IF cut sets, IF coverings and inclusion degrees is also discussed. Moreover, several extensions of IF rough sets and their hybridization with other extended rough set theories are thoroughly surveyed. The applications of IF rough sets in different real‐world problems are also discussed in detail.

 With the growth in the living standard of people, food safety and quality risk assessment has gradually become the focus. Therefore, this article realizes the dynamic risk assessment of food safety based on an improved hidden Markov model (HMM) integrating the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) (CS-HMM). The CS is used to conduct global search to obtain the initial value of HMM, and then the Baum–Welch algorithm is used for modifying the initial value to obtain a trained risk assessment model. Finally, in terms of several benchmark functions, the accuracy of the CS algorithm is better than the PSO and the GA algorithms for seeking global optimal solution. Moreover, the presented method is applied to evaluate the safety risk of the sterilized milk production. Combined with the characteristics of time and temperature, the deterioration reasons of sterilized milk are analyzed. Moreover, the proposed method has certain theoretical significance and practical value for improving the ability of food quality risk assessment and formulating control measures in advance. Practical applications The presented method is applied to evaluate the safety risk of the sterilized milk production, which are supplied by the food inspection agency of Guizhou province in China. Combined with the characteristics of time and temperature, the deterioration reasons of sterilized milk are analyzed. Furthermore, the improved model breaks out of the local optimal limit, so as to better realize the risk prediction of food and obtain better evaluation results. Based on the analysis of dynamic risk assessment result with the temperature characteristics, the future risk trend can be predicted. Meanwhile, the causes affecting the deterioration of the sterilized milk and the direction to improve the quality of the sterilized milk can be obtained. In this way, risk control measures can be taken more precisely and risks can be reduced more effectively, which is helpful to the production and storage of food products.

 q‐Rung orthopair fuzzy sets‐based decision‐theoretic rough sets for three‐way decisions under group decision making    
   
 Article    
 Sep 2019 

 Decui Liang 
  Wen Cao 
    
 As an extension of Pythagorean fuzzy sets, the q‐rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q‐ROFSs) can easily solve uncertain information in a broader perspective. Considering the fine property of q‐ROFSs, we introduce q‐ROFSs into decision‐theoretic rough sets (DTRSs) and use it to portray the loss function. According to the Bayesian decision procedure, we further construct a basic model of q‐rung orthopair fuzzy decision‐theoretic rough sets (q‐ROFDTRSs) under the q‐rung orthopair fuzzy environment. At the same time, we design the corresponding method for the deduction of three‐way decisions by utilizing projection‐based distance measures and TOPSIS. Then, we extend q‐ROFDTRSs to adapt the group decision‐making (GDM) scenario. To fuse different experts’ evaluation results, we propose some new aggregation operators of q‐ROFSs by utilizing power average (PA) and power geometric (PG) operators, that is, q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power average, q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power weighted average (q‐ROFPWA), q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power geometric, and q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power weighted geometric (q‐ROFPWG). In addition, with the aid of q‐ROFPWA and q‐ROFPWG, we investigate three‐way decisions with q‐ROFDTRSs under the GDM situation. Finally, we give the example of a rural e‐commence GDM problem to illustrate the application of our proposed method and verify our results by conducting two comparative experiments.

 Method Evaluation, Parametrization, and Result Validation in Unsupervised Data Mining: A Critical Survey    
   
 Article    
 Full-text available    
 Jul 2019 

 Albrecht Zimmermann 
    
 Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) build tools intended to help users solve data‐related problems that are infeasible for “unaugmented” humans. Tools need manuals, however, and in the case of ML/DM methods, this means guidance with respect to which technique to choose, how to parameterize it, and how to interpret derived results to arrive at knowledge about the phenomena underlying the data. While such information is available in the literature, it has not yet been collected in one place. We survey three types of work for clustering and pattern mining: (1) comparisons of existing techniques, (2) evaluations of different parameterization options and studies providing guidance for setting parameter values, and (3) work comparing mining results with the ground truth. We find that although interesting results exist, as a whole the body of work on these questions is too limited. In addition, we survey recent studies in the field of community detection, as a contrasting example. We argue that an objective obstacle for performing needed studies is a lack of data and survey the state of available data, pointing out certain limitations. As a solution, we propose to augment existing data by artificially generated data, review the state‐of‐the‐art in data generation in unsupervised mining, and identify shortcomings. In more general terms, we call for the development of a true “Data Science” that—based on work in other domains, results in ML, and existing tools—develops needed data generators and builds up the knowledge needed to effectively employ unsupervised mining techniques.

 Evolving Granular Systems    
   
 Thesis    
 Full-text available    
 Jul 2012 

 Daniel F. Leite 
    
 In recent years there has been increasing interest in computational modeling approaches to deal with real-world data streams. Methods and algorithms have been proposed to uncover meaningful knowledge from very large (often unbounded) data sets in principle with no apparent value. This thesis introduces a framework for evolving granular modeling of uncertain data streams. Evolving granular systems comprise an array of online modeling approaches inspired by the way in which humans deal with complexity. These systems explore the information flow in dynamic environments and derive from it models that can be linguistically understood. Particularly, information granulation is a natural technique to dispense unnecessary details and emphasize transparency, interpretability and scalability of information systems. Uncertain (granular) data arise from imprecise perception or description of the value of a variable. Broadly stated, various factors can affect one's choice of data representation such that the representing object conveys the meaning of the concept it is being used to represent. Of particular concern to this work are numerical, interval, and fuzzy types of granular data; and interval, fuzzy, and neurofuzzy modeling frameworks. Learning in evolving granular systems is based on incremental algorithms that build model structure from scratch on a per-sample basis and adapt model parameters whenever necessary. This learning paradigm is meaningful once it avoids redesigning and retraining models all along if the system changes. Application examples in classification, function approximation, time-series prediction and control using real and synthetic data illustrate the usefulness of the granular approaches and framework proposed. The behavior of nonstationary data streams with gradual and abrupt regime shifts is also analyzed in the realm of evolving granular computing. We shed light upon the role of interval, fuzzy, and neurofuzzy computing in processing uncertain data and providing high-quality approximate solutions and rule summary of input-output data sets. The approaches and framework introduced constitute a natural extension of evolving intelligent systems over numeric data streams to evolving granular systems over granular data streams.

 Soft clustering    
   
 Article    
 Jun 2019 

 Maria Brigida Ferraro 
  Paolo Giordani 
    
 Clustering is one of the most used tools in data analysis. In the last decades, due to the increasing complexity of data, soft clustering has received a great deal of attention. There exist different approaches that can be considered as soft. The most known is the fuzzy approach that consists in assigning objects to clusters with membership degrees, depending on the dissimilarities between each object and all the prototypes, ranging in the unit interval. Closely related to the fuzzy approach, there is the possibilistic one that, differently from the previous one, relaxes some constraints on the membership degrees. In particular, the objects are assigned to clusters with degrees of typicalities, depending just on the dissimilarities between each object and the closest prototype. A further soft approach is the rough one. In this case, there are not degrees ranging between 0 and 1 but objects with intermediate features belong to the boundary region and are assigned to more than one cluster. Even if it is not universally recognized in the scientific community as an approach of soft clustering, from our point of view, the model‐based approach can also be considered as such. Model‐based clustering methods also produce a soft partition of the objects and the posterior probability of a component membership may play a role similar to the membership degree. The four approaches are critically described from a theoretical point of view and an empirical comparative analysis is carried out. This article is categorized under: Statistical Learning and Exploratory Methods of the Data Sciences > Clustering and Classification Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis > Multivariate Analysis Statistical Learning and Exploratory Methods of the Data Sciences > Exploratory Data Analysis Abstract Soft clustering methods: fuzzy, possibilistic, rough, and model‐based approaches

  Official Statement  
   
  This (www.ickea.org) is the only official website of ICKEA ( International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Applications).  
 Recently we found a fake conference (also called ICKEA to be held in Shanghai in April) illegally copying ICKEA information including the conference history, proceedings, etc. This fake conference is nothing to do with ICKEA organizing committee. Please be careful when you trying to submit your papers and register.

 End-to-End Rule Induction from Raw Sequence Inputs  

 ICLR 2025 Conference Submission3816 Authors    
   
  24 Sept 2024 (modified: 02 Dec 2024)   ICLR 2025 Conference Submission   Everyone   Revisions    BibTeX    CC BY 4.0     

 Keywords :  Neuro-Symbolic Methods, Interpretability, Inductive Logic Programming    
 Abstract :  Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.

 GeoILP: A Synthetic Dataset to Guide Large-Scale Rule Induction  

 ICLR 2025 Conference Submission9564 Authors    
   
  27 Sept 2024 (modified: 02 Dec 2024)   ICLR 2025 Conference Submission   Everyone   Revisions    BibTeX    CC BY 4.0     

 Keywords :  inductive logic programming, rule induction, dataset    
 Abstract :  Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a machine learning approach aiming to learn explanatory rules from data. While existing ILP systems can successfully solve small-scale tasks, large-scale applications with various language biases are rarely explored. Besides, it is crucial for a large majority of current ILP systems to require expert-defined language bias, which hampers the development of ILP towards broader utilizations. In this paper, we introduce GeoILP, a large-scale synthetic dataset of diverse ILP tasks involving numerous aspects of language bias. % including complex rule forms, high deduction complexity, and more realistic assumptions. The ILP tasks are built from geometry problems, at the level from textbook exercise to regional International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), with the help of a deduction engine. These problems are elaborately selected to cover all challenging language biases, such as recursion, predicate invention, and high arity. Experimental results show that no existing method can solve GeoILP tasks. In addition, along with classic symbolic-form data, we provide image-form data to boost the development of the joint learning of neural perception and symbolic rule induction.

 IJCNN is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. Since its inception, IJCNN has been playing a leading role in promoting and facilitating interaction among researchers and practitioners, and dissemination of knowledge in neural networks and related facets of machine learning. And Rome with its history and geographical position will further contribute to grow and maintain the role of the IJCNN as a prominent platform for exchange of knowledge in neural networks and artificial intelligence.   
 The technical program, including tutorials, special sessions, workshops and plenary talks, covers almost all facets of neural networks and related learning systems including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, convolutional neural networks, spiking neural networks, cognitive algorithms, and deep learning along with a wide spectrum of applications. A special track is also included dedicated to the conference theme on “Human-AI interaction in creative arts and sciences”.   
 Prospective authors are invited to submit complete papers of no more than eight (8) pages in the IEEE two-column conference proceedings format, according to the  Paper Submission Guidelines    . All the accepted and presented papers will be published on IEEE Xplore Digital Library and indexed by Scopus.   
 Whether you are presenting your latest work, learning from experts, or networking with peers, IJCNN 2025 promises to be an unforgettable experience that will inspire and propel the AI and neural network community forward. We look forward to welcoming you in Rome!

  JOURNAL   Call for Papers: Special Issue on "Immersive Learning: From Theory to Practice, Building Evidence-Based Frameworks"    The manuscript submission deadline has been extended to December 15, 2025.  
  We are happy to announce a Call for Papers for a special issue in the journal "Computers & Education: X Reality", which is organized with iLRN and invites selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th iLRN conferences to submit extended versions. However, submissions from the academic community are welcomed, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Overview  
  The integration of immersive technologies—such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—into educational environments has shown significant potential to transform the learning experience. However, the rapid adoption of these technologies has outpaced the development of comprehensive, evidence-based frameworks that guide their practical implementation and evaluation in diverse educational contexts.  
  Immersive Learning is emerging from multi-disciplinary research in Computer Science, Game Design, UX, the Learning Sciences, and other fields that apply Immersive Learning in context. This special issue of Computers & Education: X Reality aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice in immersive learning by bringing together research that explores theoretical foundations and builds robust frameworks grounded in empirical evidence. We seek contributions that provide insights into how immersive technologies can be systematically integrated into educational settings to enhance learning outcomes, showing effective practices in immersive learning, addressing educational challenges and the technical affordances of tools and frameworks that are both scalable and sustainable.  
  This special issue is organized with the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN). Selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th annual International Conferences will be invited to submit extended versions to this Special Issue. Extended versions of papers submitted to the iLRN Conference must contain about 50% new material, and the title must clearly and unmistakably differ from the title of the article presented at the conference.  
  Likewise, we welcome submissions from the academic community, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Topics of Interest  
  This special issue invites scholars, practitioners, and technologists to contribute to the evolving landscape of immersive learning by providing research that advances theoretical understanding and offers practical, evidence-based solutions for educators worldwide.  
  We invite high-quality, original research articles, case studies, and review papers that address, but are not limited to, the following topics:

  GUIDED VIRTUAL ADVENTURE   Dive into VR Storytelling with novelist Helen Lundström Erwin!    Join us on October 24, 2024 at 9 am Pacific / 12 pm Eastern / 4 pm GMT for an exciting Guided Virtual Adventure about VR Storytelling! We are delighted to welcome Helen Lundström Erwin as our guide. This adventure will be hosted by Amany Alkhayat in Engage VR. The Engage event code is 2a0K6. The code contains a zero, not the letter O. If you are new to Engage, you can create an Engage account here: https://engagevr.io/download-engage/ Helen Lundström Erwin is recognized as the only novelist with a VR World based on a setting in their own novel. Her historical novel Sour Milk in Sheep’s Wool not only explores the early reproductive rights and suffrage movements but also inspired her VR World, The Foremothers Café. This VR Café takes you back in time to Lund, Sweden in 1918. Just like in the story, it serves as a community space for women, where Helen hosts discussions and cultural events, extending the themes of her writing into a dynamic, interactive environment. Her latest work, The Lure of Water and Wood, marks her foray into historical fantasy, drawing from real sorcery trials in 17th and 18th century Sweden, blending meticulous research with imaginative storytelling. Helen’s first novel, James’ Journey, further showcases her ability to weave deep historical insights into compelling narratives, portraying the transformative journey of a man from a pro-slavery upbringing to a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Helen has created artwork for The Foremothers Café and illustrated her Children's Book, Officer Helga Hedgehog Meets the New Neighbors. She is an active member of the Historical Novel Society-New York Chapter and of XR Women. She was honored with a 2021 (SWEA) Mona Johnson - New York Scholarship, and received a grant from The Puffin Foundation. The Foremothers Café has been nominated for Auggie Awards for Best Social Impact two years in a row, and Helen was nominated for an XR Women Award in the Trailblazing Category in 2023. Helen now serves as Secretary of the Board of SWEA (Swedish Women's Educational Association.) 
  VIRTUAL CAMPUS   Our iLRNetwork Virtual Campus is open!    University student use of the iLRN Virtual Campus XR groups meet for presentations & exploration iLRN Volunteers starting Campus Co-design - now building a spooky Halloween party! Beginning construction of iLRN's Foundations Research Library on campus on the immersive learning principles of Computer Science, Games, & the Learning Sciences Our new iLRN Frame VR Campus opened to attendees of the 10th annual iLRN Conference last June 2024. Of the collection of 25 Frame buildings on the new campus, most iLRN2024 activity took place on the dual Frame campus "hub" - that is, our Orange and Blue Exhibit Halls, respectively - where presenters from BOTH online and face-to-face (Scotland) conference venues had opportunity to place a poster and interact with visitors. Note that both virtual campus halls are always open to iLRN members and these fantastic immersive learning posters are still there for your perusal!  
  Indeed, the campus is crawling with network activity, as various initiatives sprout up in Teaching/Learning, UX/Design, and Research/Knowledge Sharing!  
  A few iLRN Frame VR Campus Highlights:  
   
  Summer '24, Doug Wilson invited his Learning, Design, and Technology students at George Mason University to meet regularly in our iLRN Student Center and explore the network co-designed FrameVR Campus. Dr. Wilson and iLRN campus staff offered the use of Frame VR's custom permissions to allow students an opportunity to pitch ideas, co-create and try out the campus' possibility spaces. > > > >  
   
  Wilson says, "FrameVR and the iLRN Student Center make great tools and provide quintessential presence to engage students on a range of topics in the instructional design space. A nimble system, graduate students swiftly got up to speed with FrameVR's easy to use tools and took part in compelling direct instruction as well as sensory experiences. Richter's presentation on the UN Sustainable Development Goals allowed students to align their creative design projects in XR with the iLRN conference theme Tech 4 Good; this introduced a high level of engagement for students who could then see their work from a global perspective and design with the greater good in mind. One student even chose to build a new virtual office for me in Frame VR as her design project! The authentic learning experiences possible in Frame VR and the iLRN Student Center underscored teaching and learning approaches illuminated in learning in activity (Engstrom, 2022), Community of Inquiry (Garrison , 2017) and situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Perhaps the most intriguing piece happened this fall at the Immersive Technology Conference on the George Mason University Arlington Campus. I setup a 60” flat screen connected to my MacBook Pro and invited students from as far away as Los Angeles to pop into Frame VR ILRN Student Center and interact live with the audience during my poster session. Student avatars in VR interacted live and face-to-face with people viewing on the big screen, a portal and intersection of the virtual and physical worlds! That was an engaging and unique experience and all with no headsets or goggles. FrameVR lowers the barriers to entry, and the global iLRN Student Center was the space! I can’t thank you and iLRN enough for making this all possible!  
  The Immersive Learning Research Network's campus is open to university member/partners in myriad different ways!  
  game jams or hackathons research talks independent student projects pedagogical or computer science design experiments international co-lab spaces In other campus activity, Randall Rode brought the EduCAUSE XR Community Group to the iLRN campus in August for exploration and discussion in the Circle of Scholars (CoS) amphitheater. Dr. Rode is presently supporting iLRN to co-develop our Community of Scholars in Immersive Learning, including public and members-only meetings in the CoS amphitheater.  
   
  > > > > > Bring YOUR immersive experience design group or team to the iLRN Campus for exploration or meeting!  
   
  Now that fall semester has arrived and universities are well underway with courses, the campus has picked up our activity and the iLRN Volunteers are more systematically managing our co-creations and other events on campus. They use our iLRN General Discord Server as a means of collaborating, working across time zones, skill sets, and campus design requests but they're ALWAYS doing something fun too and our twice-a-month meetings are always eye-opening and full of laughter and connections.  
  Lately, we've been working on turning a number of our campus buildings into our "HAUNTED VIRTUAL CAMPUS" - now in our 5th year!  
  (so I guess it's a tradition?). . . .  
   
  We're putting up some cryptic AI bots who speak of VR like a kooky steampunk character and grumpily invite you to check out other haunted spaces and leave them alone to their alarming experiments...  
   
  and finally, our lead iLRN Campus Volunteer Sarah Barker has been building a prototype Frame VR Research Library in our House 1, the "trunk" of our Knowledge Tree representing the BIG THREE disciplines that fundamentally contribute to hiqh quality Immersive Learning experiences: (1) Computer Science, (2) UX/Game Design and (3) The Learning Sciences. We are so excited of the possibilities of Sarah's contribution (check out her work on our Affiliate Partner's XR Women's Frame VR space!) and look to similarly build out 12 applied areas in Frames across our campus:

   Motivation        
   
 Show Motivation    
 Inductive programming addresses the problem of learning programs from incomplete specifications - typically from input/output examples. Beginning in the 1960s, this area of research was initiated in artificial intelligence exploring the complex cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification. Inductive programming can be seen as a subdomain of machine learning where the hypothesis space consists of classes of computer programs. Researchers working on this topic have their background in diverse areas of computer science, namely in machine learning, artificial intelligence, declarative programming, program verification, and software engineering. Furthermore, inductive programming is of interest for researchers in cognitive science, working on computational models of inductive learning from experience, and for researchers in education, especially in intelligent tutoring. A break-through from basic research to applications for the mass-market was achieved by applying inductive programming techniques to programming by examples support of end-users for Microsoft Excel (Flashfill). This Dagstuhl Seminar is planned as a continuation of Dagstuhl Seminars 13502, 15442, and 17382. In the first seminar, focus was on exploring the different areas of basic research and applications of inductive programming. In the second seminar, in-depth coverage of algorithmic methods was provided and the relation to cognitive modeling was explored. In the third seminar focus was on different application areas such as data cleansing, teaching programming, and interactive training.  
 In the fourth seminar, focus will be on the potential of inductive programming  
 as an approach to explainable AI, 
  for support in data science, 
  in relation to neural computation, especially deep networks, and 
  as a special style of human-like computing.

  Summary        
   
 Show Summary    
 Inductive programming addresses the automated or semi-automated generation of computer programs from incomplete information such as input-output examples, constraints, computation traces, demonstrations, or problem-solving experience [11]. The generated – typically declarative – program has the status of a hypothesis which has been generalized by induction. That is, inductive programming can be seen as a special approach to machine learning. In contrast to standard machine learning, only a small number of training examples is necessary. Furthermore, learned hypotheses are represented as logic or functional programs, that is they are represented on symbol level and therefore are inspectable and comprehensible [36, 15, 37, 29]. On the other hand, inductive programming is a special approach to program synthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches [39, 25, 4]. In cases where synthesis of specific algorithm details that are hard to figure out by humans inductive reasoning can be used to generate program candidates from either user-provided data such as test cases or from data automatically derived from a formal specification [35]. Finally symbolic approaches can be combined with probabilistic methods [8, 9].  
 Inductive program synthesis is of interest for researchers in artificial intelligence since the late sixties [2]. On the one hand, the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification are investigated, on the other hand methodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process are explored. One of the most relevant areas of application of inductive programming techniques is end-user programming [5, 22, 6]. For example, the Microsoft Excel plug-in Flashfill synthesizes programs from a small set of observations of user behavior [15, 14, 13]. Related applications are in process mining and in data wrangling [19, 21]. Inductive programming in general offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data [30, 23] and to learning from observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents [28, 20, 36]. Furthermore inductive programming can be applied in the context of teaching programming [38, 41]. A recent new domain of interest is how to combine inductive programming with blackbox approaches, especially in the context of (deep) neural networks [10] and in data science.  
 Relation to Previous Dagstuhl-Seminars  
 The seminar is a continuation Dagstuhl-Seminars 13502, 15442, and 17382. In the first seminar, the focus was on establishing the research community by exploring the different areas of basic research and applications of inductive programming and identifying commonalities and differences in methods and goals. In the second seminar, more in-depth coverage of algorithmic methods was provided and the relation of inductive programming to cognitive modeling was explored. The third seminar had a main focus on applications in data cleansing teaching programming, and interactive training. Furthermore, first proposals for neural approaches to learning for inductive programming were presented.  
 Besides many new insights from many discussions, visible outcomes from the previous seminars are:

  For the fourth seminar, we extend our invitation to researchers from deep learning and to researchers addressing statistical machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. The focus of the fourth seminar has been on the potential of inductive programming for explainable AI, especially in combination with (deep) neural networks and with data science.   
 Inductive Programming as a Approach to Explainable AI  
 Recently it has been recognized that explainability is crucial for machine learning to be usable in real world domains – especially such where erroneous decisions might be harmful to humans. Consequently, interfaces which explain (aspects) of classifier decisions have been proposed – especially in the context of deep learning [32, 3]. The notion of explainability has already been addressed in the early days of machine learning: During the 1980s Michie defined Machine Learning in terms of two orthogonal axes of performance: predictive accuracy and comprehensibility of generated hypotheses. Since predictive accuracy was readily measurable and comprehensibility not so, later definitions in the 1990s, such as that of Mitchell [27], tended to use a one-dimensional approach to Machine Learning based solely on predictive accuracy, ultimately favouring statistical over symbolic Machine Learning approaches.  
 Inductive Programming and Neural Computation  
 The deep learning community has been interested in taking on challenging tasks from the artificial intelligence community. It is therefore no surprise that they have also started to look into inductive and automatic programming. In particular, they have contributed several mixtures of traditional computational models with those of neural networks. For instance the neural Turing machine [12] integrates a neural network with an external memory and it is able to learn simple algorithms such as copy and sort, the neural program interpreter [31] is a recurrent neural network that learns to represent and execute programs from program traces while [33] present an end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth and [34, 24] for a declarative Prolog like language. The central goal in these approaches is to obtain an end-to-end differentiable model. While initial results are promising, the approaches still require a lot of data to be trained or need to scale up. This contrasts with the more traditional symbolic approaches to inductive programming and thus a key opportunity is to further cross-fertalize these two approaches.  
 Inductive Programming and Human-like Computing  
 The human ability to master complex demands is to a large extend based on the ability to exploit previous experiences. Based on our experience, we are able to predict characteristics or reactions of (natural or man-made, inanimate or animate) objects, we can reason about possible outcomes of actions, and we can apply previously successful routines and strategies to new tasks and problems. In philosophy, psychology and artificial intelligence, researchers proposed that the core process to expand knowledge, that is, construct hypotheses, in such a way that we can transfer knowledge from previous experience to new situations is inductive inference [18, 16, 40].  
 One special aspect of induction is that humans are able to acquire complex, productive rule sets from experience. Following Chomsky, rules are productive when they can be applied in situations of various complexity. Typical examples of such rule sets are knowledge about natural language grammar, recursive concepts such as ancestor and recursive problem solving strategies. For example, if humans have learned how to solve Tower of Hanoi problems with three and four discs, at least some of them are able to generalize the underlying strategy for solving problems with an arbitrary number of discs.  
 Inductive programming provides mechanisms to generate such productive, recursive rule sets. Examples of recent work on using inductive programming to model this learningcapability of human cognition are [26, 20, 36, 17, 23]. Therefore, it might be fruitful for cognitive scientists to get acquainted with inductive programming as one approach to model the acquisition of complex knowledge structures. On the other hand, knowledge gained from experiments in human problem solving, concept learning and language acquisition can be a source of inspiration for new algorithmic approaches to inductive programming.  
 Objectives and Expected Outcomes of the Seminar  
 The previous seminars resulted in new collaborations between researchers from different backgrounds as documented in joint publications and we expect that the collaborations will continue, deepen and extend, resulting not only in further joint publications but also in joint research projects.  
 In the fourth seminar, we continued and extended previous discussions addressing the following aspects:  
 Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches are more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning and probabilistic programming. Focus here is on possibilities of combining (deep) neural approaches or probabilistic programming with (symbolic) inductive programming, especially with respect to new approaches to comprehensibility of machine learned models and on explainable AI. 
  Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems. 
  Discussing current applications of inductive programming in end-user programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application. 
  Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming under the label of human-like computation. 
  Strengthening the relation of inductive programming and data science, especially with respect to data cleansing and data wrangling. 
  Concluding Remarks and Future Plans  
 In the wrapping-up section, we decided to move the IP webpage to a Wiki and encouraged all participants to make available their systems, tutorial/lecture slides and publications there. As the grand IP challenge we came up with 2017 is still up:  
 An IP program should invent an algorithm publishable in a serious journal (e.g., an integer factorization algorithm) or win a programming competition!

   Motivation        
   
 Show Motivation    
 The Dagstuhl Seminar Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming  (AAIP'17) is a follow-up to the successful seminars 15442 ( http://www.dagstuhl.de/15442  ) and 13502 ( http://www.dagstuhl.de/13502  ) and is the 7th AAIP event overall (started as AAIP'05 as ICML workshop).  
 The term 'inductive programming' (IP) was coined in 2005 for the first AAIP event as a common label for inductive logic programming (ILP) and inductive functional programming. IP research addresses the problem of learning (mostly declarative) programs from incomplete specifications, such as input/output examples, observed traces, or constraints. Beginning in the 1960-ies, this area of research was initiated in artificial intelligence (AI) exploring the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification. Furthermore, applications of AI for software engineering are investigated resulting in methodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process. Inductive programming can be seen as generalization of current machine learning where the hypothesis space consists of classes of computer programs. Approaches to inductive programming are gaining interest in the machine learning community as the need for interpretability, verification, and debugging of learnt models (programs) is growing.  
 Researchers working on IP are distributed over different communities, especially inductive logic programming, evolutionary programming, grammar inference, functional programming, and programming languages and verification. Furthermore, similar approaches are of interest in programming by demonstration applications for end-user programming as well as in cognitive models of inductive learning.  
 Interest in IP has been steadily growing over the last years. One reason is that with the release of FlashFill as a plug-in tool for Microsoft Excel there exists a convincing demonstration that inductive programming research has matured in such a way that commercial applications become feasible. Another one is that researchers in artificial intelligence and in machine learning are becoming more and more interested in comprehensible and explainable systems and inductive programming approaches provide symbolic representations of rules.  
 A long-term objective of the seminar series is to establish inductive programming as a self-contained research topic in artificial intelligence, especially as a field of machine learning and of cognitive modeling.  
 The seminar serves as community building event by bringing together researchers from different areas of inductive programming {especially inductive logic programming and inductive functional programming {, from different application areas such as end-user programming and tutoring, and from cognitive science research, especially from cognitive models of inductive (concept) learning. In this meeting we are open to discussions of the relationship between IP and other forms of machine learning including, for instance, neuro-symbolic learning. For successful community building we seek to balance junior and senior researchers, and to mix researchers from universities and from industry.  
 The two previous seminars resulted in new collaborations between researchers from different back-grounds as documented in joint publications and we expect that the collaborations will continue, deepen and extend, resulting not only in further joint publications but also in joint research projects.  
 In this seminar, we plan to continue and extend discussion addressing the following aspects:  
 Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning. 
  Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems. 
  Discussing current applications of inductive programming in end-user programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application. 
  Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming.

  Summary        
   
 Show Summary    
 Inductive programming (IP) addresses the automated or semi-automated generation of computer programs from incomplete information such as input-output examples, constraints, computation traces, demonstrations, or problem-solving experience [5]. The generated - typically declarative - program has the status of a hypothesis which has been generalized by induction. That is, inductive programming can be seen as a special approach to machine learning. In contrast to standard machine learning, only a small number of training examples is necessary. Furthermore, learned hypotheses are represented as logic or functional programs, that is, they are represented on symbol level and therefore are inspectable and comprehensible [17, 8, 18]. On the other hand, inductive programming is a special approach to program synthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches [20, 14, 2]. In cases where synthesis of specific algorithm details that are hard to figure out by humans inductive reasoning can be used to generate program candidates from either user-provided data such as test cases or from data automatically derived from a formal specification [16].  
 Inductive program synthesis is of interest for researchers in artificial intelligence since the late sixties [1]. On the one hand, the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification are investigated, on the other hand methodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process are explored. One of the most relevant areas of application of inductive programming techniques is end-user programming [3, 12, 4]. For example, the Microsoft Excel plug-in Flashfill synthesizes programs from a small set of observations of user behavior [8, 7, 6]. Related applications are in process mining and in data wrangling [11]. Inductive programming in general offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data [15, 13] and to learning from observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents [10, 17]. Furthermore, inductive programming can be applied in the context of teaching programming [19, 21].  
 Recent Trends and Applications  
 When the first Dagstuhl Seminar on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming took place in 2013, the following trends could be identified:  
 Combining different approaches to inductive programming to leverage their complementary strengths. 
  New inductive programming approaches based on adapting and using well-developed techniques such as SAT-solving. 
  Putting inductive programming to application, for example in the areas of automated string manipulations in spreadsheets or web programming. 
  Applying concepts of inductive programming to cognitive models of learning structural concepts. 
  The main outcomes of the second seminar were (1) a joint publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal with respect to the evaluation of computational models solving intelligence test problems – among them inductive programming systems [9], (2) a joint publication addressing comprehensibility as a second criterium to evaluate machine learning approaches besides accuracy [18], and (3) a NIPS’2016 workshop on Neural Nets and Program Induction.  
 Based on the results of the second seminar, the focus of the third seminar has been on the following aspects:  
 Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning. 
  Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems. 
  Discussing current applications of inductive programming in enduser programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application. 
  Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming. 
  In the seminar, we brought together researchers from different areas of computer science - especially from machine learning, AI, declarative programming, and software engineering - and researchers from cognitive psychology interested in inductive learning as well as in teaching and learning computer programming. Furthermore, participants from industry presented current as well as visionary applications for inductive programming.  
 The seminar was opened with lecture style talks introducing the four major approaches of inductive programming: Inductive functional programming, inductive logic programming, inductive probabilistic logical programming, and programming by example.  
 Talks covered current developments of IP algorithms, challenging applications -especially in data wrangling and in education -, and relations of IP to cognition.  
 In addition, several system demons and tutorials were given: Igor and EasyIgor (by Sebastian Seufert and Ute Schmid), MagicHaskeller (by Susumu Katayama), Sketch (by Armando Solar-Lezama), PROSE (by Oleksandr Polozov), Slipcover (by Fabrizio Riguzzi), and TaCLe (by Luc De Raedt).  
 The following topics were identified and further discussed in working groups during the seminar:  
 How to determine relevancy of background knowledge to reduce search? 
  Integrating IP with other types of machine learning, especially Deep Learning? 
  Data wrangling as exiting area of application. 
  Additional topics identified as relevant have been anomaly detection, noise, robustnes, as well as non-example based interaction (e.g., natural language).  
 Concluding remarks and future plans  
 In the wrapping-up section, we collected answers to the question  
  “What would constitute progress at Dagstuhl 2019?”  
   
 The most prominent answers were  
 make available systems, data sets (via IP webpage) 
  compare systems 
  common vocabulary, work on applications attempted by others: drawing problems, string transformation, general ai challenge, benchmarks starexec, learn robot strategy, grammar learning what is inductive programming 
  open problems 
  As the grand IP challenge we came up with: An IP program should invent an algorithm publishable in a serious journal (e.g., an integer factorization algorithm) or win a programming competition!

  Conference (Montreal)  : Saturday, August 16 to Friday, August 22, 2025.  
  Satellite event (Guangzhou)  : Thursday, August 28 to Sunday, August 31, 2025.  
 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research.  
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.  
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

  ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2025  
 Madison, Wisconsin, USA  
 October 28-31, 2025  

 The 2025 Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a three-and-a-half day event focusing on Internet measurement and analysis. The conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. IMC 2025 is the 25th in a series  of highly successful Internet Measurement Workshops and Conferences.  
 The ACM IMC 2025 conference will be held from October 28-31, 2025 in Madison, WI, USA.  
 Announcements  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected. As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see the Call for Papers   . Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected. As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see the Call for Papers   . Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected. As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see the Call for Papers   . Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.

 WELCOME TO IPMV 2025   
 2025 7th International Conference on Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV 2025) will be held in Hong Kong, China on January 10-12, 2025, co-sponsored by Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong and University of Macau.   
 Image Processing and Machine Vision usually plays an important role in the transition from data storage to decision systems based on large databases of signals such as the obtained from sensor networks, internet services, or communication systems. These systems imply developing both computational solutions and novel models. Signals from real-world systems are usually complex such as speech, music, bio-medical, multimedia, among others. Thus, Image Processing and Machine Vision techniques are very useful for these type of systems to automate processing and analysis techniques to retrieve information from data storage.  
 IPMV is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars, professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster working relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It will put special emphasis on the participations of PhD students, Postdoctoral fellows and other young researchers from all over the world. It would be beneficial to bring together a group of experts from diverse fields to discuss recent progress and to share ideas on open questions.  
 You are invited to submit a paper for consideration all over the globe interested in the areas of machine learning methods/ algorithms, signal processing theory and methods, data mining, artificial intelligence, optimization and applications to human brain disorders like epilepsy etc. Other applications of image processing and machine vision techniques are also welcome. Looking forward to welcoming you in Hong Kong!  

 Important DATES:   

 Submission Deadline: November 20, 2024    
 Notification Date: December 10, 2024

 Feedback  Survey  

 The mathematical theory and practice of both cryptography and coding underpins the provision of effective security and reliability for data communication, processing and storage. This nineteenth International Conference in an established and successful IMA series on the theme of “Cryptography and Coding” solicits original research papers on all technical aspects of cryptography and coding.  
  Submissions are welcome on any cryptographic or coding-theoretic topic including, but not limited to:  
  • Foundational theory and mathematics;  
  • The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic or coding primitives and protocols  
  • Secure implementation and optimisation in hardware or software; and  
  • Applied aspects of cryptography and coding.  
  
 Invited Speakers  
 Carla Ràfols (Pompeu Fabra University)   
 Amortization in zkSNARKs   
 Prover complexity is one of the main bottlenecks in some of the best-known succinct, non-interactive arguments. Thus, many works “delay” or amortize parts of these proofs. In this talk, I will overview these techniques and the most recent constructions, and present new applications of these ideas.  
 Dario Fiore (IMDEA Software Institute)   
 Succinct and Functional Vector Commitments   
 Vector commitments are a special class of commitment schemes in which one can commit to a long vector and open single positions of the vector with the crucial property that commitments and openings are short. Functional commitments generalize vector commitments so that one can open, in a succinct way, to functions of the committed vector.  
  In this talk, I will present the notion of functional commitments and the recent constructions of this primitive that support the evaluation of arbitrary circuits, and I will discuss some of their applications.

 ECM Committee: 2025 Call for self-nominations  
   
 The ECM Committee provides a focus for the ideas and activities of early-career IMA members, in addition to engaging, empowering and mobilising this group in supporting the IMA’s charitable aims, including promoting mathematics. Most prominently, the committee collaborates with the wider IMA to organise and run many events for the early career mathematician community, such as Virtual Maths Teas, idea exchanges on teaching in academia, hackathons and mock study groups, a seminar series and a webinar series. These provide a platform for attendees to meet and network with like-minded individuals.  
 Over recent years, the ECM has seen great success and continues to go from strength to strength. This has only been made possible through the hard work and dedication of the ECM Committee. We are therefore looking for enthusiastic and committed ECM members to take up the mantle and work to build on the great work that has been achieved so far. Please note that the committee collaboration mostly takes place online and there is no expectation to volunteer in-person.  
 The posts available for election are:  
 Vice Chair and Chair Designate  – The Vice Chair supports the Chair, arranges committee meetings, and records and circulates committee discussions and actions. The Vice Chair is also the Chair Designate and is expected to take over as the new Chair the following year.  
 The Chair provides leadership and a focus for the group and supports all committee endeavours. The Chair is responsible for leading committee meetings, coordinating responses to emails sent to the IMA ECM email mailbox, and acts as direct liaison with the IMA Council and Secretariat.” The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Vice Chair and Chair Designate, 1 year as Chair, and 1 year as Immediate Past Chair.   
 Event Leader Designate  – The Event Leader Designate shadows and assists the Event Leader in the development of new and existing events for the ECM community.The Event Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Event Leader the following year. The Event Leader is responsible for supporting the leadership of our ECM subgroup to coordinate event organisation over the year. The role is to come up with new ideas for events, connect with maths communities to identify volunteers to support in sessions and facilitate events.  The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Event Leader Designate and 1 year as Event Leader.   
 Engagement Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Engagement Leader Designate shadows and assists the Engagement Leader. The Engagement Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Engagement Leader the following year.  
 The Engagement Leader’s role is to encourage ECM members to participate more actively with the IMA through the promotion of ECM events, encouraging the upgrade of membership and gaining Chartered designation, or encouraging engagement at the local IMA branch level if available. In addition, the Engagement Leader is involved in coordinating the Committee’s communication channels such as regular updates in Mathematics Today, and supporting the development and curation of engagement channels. The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Engagement Leader Designate and 1 year as Engagement Leader.   
 EDI Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate shadows and assists the Diversity and Inclusion Leader. The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Diversity and Inclusion Leader at the end of the 2 year term of the current Diversity and Inclusion Leader (February 2026).  
 The Diversity and Inclusion leader’s role is to ensure the actions of the ECM committee are inline with the wider IMA diversity and inclusion activities. They are to provide oversight on how ECM committee actions may be best implemented to promote Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, and to make sure that any EDI concerns are appropriately addressed. They are to suggest ways the ECM committee can better engage with, and encourage, ECMs from more diverse backgrounds to follow mathematics as a career, become involved with the IMA, and become involved with the ECM committee. The  Diversity and Inclusion  l eader liaises with the IMA’s diversity champion, ECM events leader, and ECM engagement leader to achieve these aims. They also feedback directly to the IMA diversity champion thoughts that the ECM committee has to improve diversity and inclusion in the ECM population, and the IMA as a whole.  The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Diversity and Inclusion Leader and 2 years as Diversity and Inclusion Leader.   
 To put forward a self-nomination for this year’s ECM Committee, please send a short biography¹ and a paragraph outlining which role you are applying for and why you feel you would be a good fit for this position. For reference, you may wish to look at the role outlines and biographies of the current committee on the ECM Committee webpage  . If you would like further information, perhaps about a particular role or the commitment required, please email ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 The deadline for nominations is 23:59 on Wednesday 8th January 2025  . All ECM members who hold an IMA membership of any grade (e.g. Member, Associate Member, Student Member) are eligible, so submit your nominations ASAP! The election period will then run from 13-24 January 2025, during which time all self-nominations received for the above posts will be circulated. IMA ECM members will be eligible to vote for those who they believe best fit these posts. Results are expected to be finalised early in the new year, so that the new committee will be ready to take over by Monday 3 February 2025.  
 Please send nominations to ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 We follow the IMA Diversity Statement, and endeavour to create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere at the committee, with a diverse range of participants. Applicants from groups which are under-represented in the mathematical sciences are particularly encouraged.  
 ¹ By submitting a biography for consideration, you give your consent for it to be used in emails as part of the election process, and in print and on the website should you be successfully elected. Should you be elected a photograph (High-resolution preferred) will also be requested, and used in print and on the website.

  Submission Instructions

  Committees 
  Sponsorship 

 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) seeks papers on the topic of measurement-based research in data communications. The focus of IMC 2025 will be on research that improves the practice of network measurement, illuminates some facet of an operational network, or both. Please see the Call for Papers   for a list of topics of particular relevance.  
 To submit a paper to the IMC 2025 conference, please read the rest of this document regarding paper formatting, registration, ethics, anonymity, and other important issues relevant to your submission.  
 For the Replicability track, an earlier Expression of Interest (EoI) is necessary (see the Call for Papers   ). The submission deadline for the EoI will be announced later, since there will be only one full paper deadline for the replicability track and it will be the one on May 15th, 2025.  
 For full papers use the paper submission site   to:  
 Register your abstract by | Thursday November 14, 2024 at 11:59PM AoE (UTC-12) | . 
  Submit your paper by | Thursday November 21, 2024 at 11:59PM AoE (UTC-12) | . 
  The above are hard deadlines and no extensions will be given.  
 Paper Formatting  
 All submissions, including invited papers on the Replicability Track, must obey the following formatting requirements.  
 Page limits | Full papers: up to 13 pages for technical content + unlimited pages for references and appendix 
  Short papers: up to 6 pages for technical content + unlimited pages for references and appendix 
  Note that any paper with technical content greater than 6 pages in length will be reviewed as a full paper, even if it contains fewer than 13 pages. 
  The paper body must include some statement about ethical considerations in an appendix section titled | Ethics | . This could simply contain the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues”, or where relevant (for example, but not exclusively, a paper involving human subjects), the discussion may be more detailed. See the Ethics section below for additional requirements for research that involves human subjects or other ethical concerns. 
  Appendices may not be used to abuse page limits. See the section regarding appendices below. 
  Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text. Fonts used in other elements of the paper (e.g., figures) should be no smaller than 9 point. 
  Submissions that do not comply with these requirements will be rejected without review.  The ACM template   style file satisfies the formatting requirements, provided you compile your source with options that produce letter page size and  10-point  fonts. The following settings in your LaTeX source should achieve that (but please verify the output):  
 \documentclass[10pt,sigconf,letterpaper,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Note that the above example includes an option ( nonacm  ) that removes the copyright block; this should only be removed for submissions. Camera-ready formats may change.  
 As an example, we also provide a sample template for ACM conference proceedings   , which you can make use of.  
 After the submission deadline, we will use the HotCRP format checking tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations.  
 Please make sure that your submitted paper satisfies the following:  
 You must list the submission number and the number of pages (ideally) in your paper in the author block, e.g., “Paper #N, 13 pages body, 15 pages total”, beneath your title. Registering your title, abstract, etc., will provide a paper submission number. Per the anonymity guidelines, you must remove any author names. 
  You must provide an abstract, and it should be of no more than 200 words. 
  You must number the pages. 
  You must submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format) and ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Other formats, including Postscript, will not be accepted. Avoid using non-standard fonts. The PC must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts that are embedded in the PDF file. 
  You should ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc. 
  You should limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB. 
  ACM provides guidelines and tools to support publishing in colors | https://authors.acm.org/journals/accessibility-recommendations-for-publishing-in-color | . Ideally, you should ensure that the paper prints well on black-and-white printers and e-paper (not color printers) and is legible to those with color blindness. Pay particular attention to figures and graphs in the paper to ensure that they are legible without color. Explicitly using grayscale colors will provide best control over how graphs and figures will be displayed in black-and-white. 
  You should ensure to avoid charged terminology. You will find suggestions for alternative terms at | https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter | . 
  Appendices  
 Although there is no page-limit to the appendices, they may not be used to abuse page limits. The page-limited body of the paper should be self-contained. Apart from the Ethics section, reviewers are not required to read any  of the appendices—and in fact will be discouraged from reading them except for relatively minor clarifying points. Papers will be evaluated based on what is in the main body of the paper.  
 A good rule of thumb is to think of the appendix as slightly more than a preemptive rebuttal: it should clarify details that, while not major enough to merit inclusion in the main body of the paper, may help clarify. Unlike a rebuttal, appendices can contain experiments and data that are not in the main body of the paper, but cannot count towards the paper’s main contributions.  
 Examples of appropriate use of appendices includes:  
 Including statistically significant ML features in the main body of the paper and insignificant features in the appendix. (This ensures that the main result is in the main body, while using the appendix to preemptively address reviewer questions like “Did you consider…?”) 
  Specific experimentation configuration parameters that, while not immediately critical to understanding the paper, would help clarify details. For instance, the full script of a user interview or survey. 
  Detailed description of the artifacts accompanying the paper. 
  Examples of inappropriate  use of appendices includes:  
 Plots that provide the primary supporting evidence of the paper’s contributions. 
  Full explanations of experiment methodology, with only a pointer to them in the main body of the paper. 
  Authorship and Conflicts  
 As part of the paper registration, authors will be required to provide paper metadata which includes title and abstract, author names, affiliations, contact email addresses, topics matching the subject matter of the paper, track (main or replicability), and conflicts with program committee (PC) members.  
 Broadly, we define conflict of interest with a PC member using the following principles:  
 You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the last 12 months, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. 
  You have a professional partnership as follows: | Past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee. 
  Collaboration on a project, publication, or grant proposal within the past 2 years (i.e., 2022 or later). 
  The PC chairs and members will review conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts where necessary and sanity checking cases where conflicts do not appear justified. If there is no basis for PC conflicts provided by authors, those conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict to avoid individual reviewers may lead to your paper being rejected. If you have concerns, please contact the PC chairs.  
 As an ACM conference, all authors are required to adhere to ACM’s policy on authorship. For definitions and clarifications, please see ACM Policy on Authorship   .  
 Anonymity Guidelines  
 IMC will use double blind submissions, per the following guidelines:  
 Author names and affiliations must not appear on any submission. 
  Identifying information such as grant numbers must not be included on submissions. 
  The text of the submission must refer to the authors’ own previous work in the third person. 
  In addition to submitting an anonymized paper, double-blind reviewing requires that both authors and reviewers take care while reviewing is happening.  
 Authors are welcome to release their paper in a non-peer-reviewed location (such as a technical report by your institution or arXiv), but you should not broadcast information about the publication widely. For example, do not post it to large mailing lists or social media forums where PC members would easily encounter it, and do not do general press releases. Authors are also welcome to talk about their work (as work-in-progress) at local institutions. In either case, authors should be aware of PC members who might encounter the work and avoid sharing the work in a way that a PC member would encounter it. Authors who are unsure of whether they are allowed to publicize their double-blind submissions should contact the program committee co-chairs at | imc2025pcchairs@acm.org | . 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double-blind reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  IMC recognizes that measurement research sometimes leverages unique capabilities that are publicly known, but not available for general use (e.g., measurement platforms, unique vantage points, tools, datasets, etc.). Revealing access to these capabilities or knowledge of them which could be interpreted as only being possible for their originators/authors, will de-facto de-anonymize a submission. However, attempts to anonymize these capabilities will not allow authors to leverage previous work on developing sound measurement capabilities, leaves reviewers without a full understanding of the new work, and may also be essentially impossible in some cases. IMC recognizes an exception for authors referring to such capabilities—even though this may de-anonymize submissions. The PC will not penalize submissions for these breaches of anonymization. We make several important comments on this exception:  
 While this exception will be important in some cases, most submissions can be effectively anonymized and therefore invoking this exception is expected to be relatively rare. 
  This exception only applies to text that discusses capabilities that cannot be blinded without significantly degrading the submission. The submission is expected to otherwise be anonymized per the general guidelines. Frivolous use of this exception to de-anonymize submissions due to laziness or in an attempt to curry favor may be held against a submission. 
  The expectation is that this exception will mostly be invoked for existing lines of research whereby authors are leveraging some well-known, but non-public facility. In most cases, first time use of a tool, vantage point, dataset, etc. will not be known to the community and, hence, can be reasonably well anonymized. 
  Illustrative examples of anonymity policy   
 Even though a specific vantage point is unique—e.g., monitoring the border of a specific University—that specificity is often not important to the submission and using a generic label like “a medium size European University” will suffice. 
  A unique vantage point—e.g., a large network telescope—need not be named, per se. However, authors should not elide important details about the vantage point in the name of strict anonymization. For instance, while the organization running a network telescope need not be given, authors are free to convey the size and scope of the telescope—even if these details give a strong indication of the authors’ organization. 
  Consider a measurement app for measuring mobile phones whereby neither the source code nor the collected data have been publicly released. A first submission on the app and data can be readily anonymized. Subsequent IMC submissions that leverage data from the app or which extend the app may name the app in order to leverage the previous work—even if these details give a strong indication of author identity. 
  A public dataset—e.g., RouteViews—can and should be named. Since the dataset is public anyone can utilize the data and therefore this has no bearing on the anonymity of the submission. 
  A public or a widely accessible measurement platform—e.g., RIPE Atlas—can and should be named. Since the platform is widely available, naming the platform has no bearing on the anonymity of the submission. 
  While the program committee will allow for breaches of anonymization to name unique capabilities where important, authors are encouraged to be judicious in their use of this exception. Specific questions should be forwarded to the program committee chairs.  
 Further information on anonymity policy   
  The IMC Steering Committee has also released a statement on double-blind review  .  
 Ethics  
 The program committee may raise concerns around the ethics of the work, even if it does not involve human subjects. All papers must include, in a clearly marked appendix section with the heading “Ethics”, a statement about ethical issues; papers that do not include such a statement may be rejected.  This could be, if appropriate for the paper, simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues.” If the work involves human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc.), the paper should clearly discuss these issues, in the ethics section.  
 Research that entails experiments involving human subjects or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) should adhere to community norms. Any work that raises potential ethics considerations should indicate this on the submission form. The basic principles of ethical research are outlined in the Belmont Report   : (1) respect for persons (which may involve obtaining consent); (2) beneficence (a careful consideration of risks and benefits); and (3) justice (ensuring that parts of the population that bear the risks of the research also are poised to obtain some benefit from it). Authors should further consult the ACM policy on research involving human subjects   for further information on ethical principles that apply to this conference.  
 Research involving human subjects must be approved by the researchers’ respective Institutional Review Boards before the research takes place. Authors should indicate on the submission form whether the work involves human subjects. If so, the authors must indicate whether an IRB protocol has been approved for the research, or if the research has been determined exempt (either self-determination or IRB determination). We expect that any research follows the practices and procedures of the institution(s) where the work is being carried out; for example, some universities require separate approval for the use of campus data. We expect researchers to abide by these protocols.  
 We recognize that different IRBs follow different procedures for determining the status of human subject research, and approval or exempt status from a single institution may not align with community norms. To help the Ethics Committee review cases of concern, there is a need for more information about the research protocol. To this end, if the work involves human subjects, the authors must include with their submission a copy of the form that was used to determine IRB status (approved or exempt), sufficiently anonymized to preserve double-blind review.  
 If the submission describes research involving human subjects and none of the authors are at an institution with an IRB (or equivalent), the authors are nonetheless expected to follow a research protocol that adheres to ethical principles, as stated in the ACM policy on research involving human subjects   . In such cases, the authors must use the Ethics section of their appendix to explain how their research protocol satisfies the principles of ethical research.  
 Some research does not involve human subjects yet nonetheless raises questions of ethics, which may be wide-ranging and not necessarily limited to direct effects. We encourage authors to be mindful of the ethics of the research that they undertake; these considerations are often not clear-cut, but often warrant thoughtful consideration. Discussions of these issues should be placed in the “Ethics” appendix section mentioned above, or in the main body of the paper where appropriate.  
 Additionally, the program committee reserves the right to conduct additional evaluations and reviews of research ethics and reserves the right to independent judgment concerning the ethics of the conducted research.  
 Contact the program committee co-chairs at imc2025pcchairs@acm.org  if you have any questions.  
 Paper Novelty  
 Under no circumstances, except where noted below, should authors submit previously-published work, submit the same work simultaneously to multiple venues, or submit papers that plagiarize the work of other authors. Like other conferences and journals, IMC prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have engaged in them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the integrity of papers under consideration. If the PC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.  
 The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission.  
 Paper Acceptance  
 The IMC 2025 PC will notify authors of acceptance/rejection decisions by March 26, 2025. All accepted papers may be shepherded by members of the PC. Authors of accepted papers should plan to interact with their shepherds immediately after notification, and to budget sufficient time between acceptance notification and the camera-ready deadline (April 26, 2025) to coordinate with their shepherd. It is a requirement that the paper be considered acceptable to the assigned shepherd so that the updates to the paper reflect the issues raised by the PC (conflicts will be mediated by the PC chairs) before the paper is considered “accepted” to appear in the conference proceedings. In addition, the publisher of the IMC proceedings will review all accepted papers submitted for the camera-ready deadline. Authors should also budget sufficient time immediately after the camera-ready deadline to be available and responsive to any editing changes requested by the publisher.  
 After acceptance, substantive changes to paper titles require approval by the PC chairs. Only in exceptional circumstances should authors change their author list, and only with the approval of the PC chairs.  
 Authors of accepted papers will also need to sign an ACM copyright-release form. All rejected papers will be treated as permanently confidential.  
 Use of Generative AI  
 While generative AI systems—such as large language models (LLMs)—are powerful and useful tools, there remain open questions as to how and which data they use to train, raising potential concerns over integrity and confidentiality. The ACM has established a set of guidelines pertaining to how authors and reviewers can use generative AI. We summarize some of the main points below, but we refer authors to the following links. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in paper rejection.  
 By authors  : The ACM’s author guidelines  state that authors are allowed to use generative AI in limited ways, and that their use must be acknowledged in the paper. For small portions of text (phrases or sentences), papers must include a footnote stating that it was generated by AI; for larger portions of text, graphics, and other content, authors must disclose in the Appendix what content was generated by an AI, along with the specific tools and versions used. Please refer to the ACM guidelines for more specific instructions.  
 By reviewers:  Reviewers are not allowed to upload any portion of the submitted papers to generative AI tools. However, according to the ACM’s peer review guidelines  , reviewers may upload the content of their own reviews to generative AI “with the sole purpose of improving the quality and readability of reviewer reports for the author, provided any and all parts of the review that would potentially identify the submission, author identities, reviewer identity, or other confidential content is removed prior to uploading into third party tools.”  
 If you have any questions pertaining to the use of generative AI by either authors or reviewers, please write to the IMC 2025 PC chairs imc2025pcchairs@acm.org

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2025  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality) 
  methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena 
  systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings 
  theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques 
  novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing) 
  reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions 
  descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue 
  Networks of interest include:  
 Internet transit networks 
  edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks 
  data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure 
  peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks 
  software-defined networks 
  online social networks 
  online services, platforms, and content providers 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site   .  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 All papers accepted as part of the reproducibility track will be included in the conference proceedings with the title indicating the track. The accepted papers will also have an opportunity to be presented during the poster session and an invited subset will have an opportunity to be presented as in-person talks.  
 See the Important Dates section   for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC Cycle 2 deadline. There won’t be a replicability track submission deadline in Cycle 1 (November 2024).  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. These reviewers will be reminded of the specific expectations for short papers. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy   and the ACM Plagiarism Policy   . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions   does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission. This year we will also ask authors to declare if a previous version of their paper was submitted at past editions of IMC or to any other ACM conference.  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 This is the first edition of IMC with two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)  and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.  
 [Please read carefully] These novelties will affect decisions and submissions in the following way:   
 ● Accept  : Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings. Accepted papers submitted to the November deadline will appear as accepted on the IMC website and the authors will be permitted to talk about these upcoming publications, for example listing them on their CVs.  
 ● One-Shot-Revision  : Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. At that point, the same reviewers will judge them. This judgment will be made on the basis of whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. The one-shot revisions can be submitted to the next immediate deadline (e.g., Nov -> May). In addition, only for revised submissions sent to the “May” deadline, we will actually set their submission deadline approximately 1 month later (e.g., June 20th, 2025). [The rationale is to give authors approximately 3 months to work on their revision, but the notification of papers submitted in November is less than 2 months apart from the May submission deadline.]  
  To avoid overwhelming the review process, the criteria for selecting the one-shot-revision option have been codified in a document that we submitted for comment to the community in early 2024 and program chairs will coordinate with TPC members to make sure a balance is reached. E.g., one-shot-revision papers must have at least one champion among reviewers, advocating for the relevance and timeliness of the work; only up to 3 additions/changes to the paper can be asked; and the TPC must agree that if those 3 conditions are satisfied then there is no doubt that the paper deserves to be accepted.  
 ● Reject  : Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. I.e., approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to. Note: papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 2024 deadline. This includes rejected short papers that authors intend to extend to the long format for a new submission. They can be submitted in May 2025.   
 IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; (2) a Best Student Paper award; and (3) a Community Contribution award. All accepted papers are eligible for the best paper award; the best student paper award is limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.  
 Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male (“he”, “his”), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people’s diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves “husband” and “wife”. Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following:  
 Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 ECM Committee: 2025 Call for self-nominations  
   
 The ECM Committee provides a focus for the ideas and activities of early-career IMA members, in addition to engaging, empowering and mobilising this group in supporting the IMA’s charitable aims, including promoting mathematics. Most prominently, the committee collaborates with the wider IMA to organise and run many events for the early career mathematician community, such as Virtual Maths Teas, idea exchanges on teaching in academia, hackathons and mock study groups, a seminar series and a webinar series. These provide a platform for attendees to meet and network with like-minded individuals.  
 Over recent years, the ECM has seen great success and continues to go from strength to strength. This has only been made possible through the hard work and dedication of the ECM Committee. We are therefore looking for enthusiastic and committed ECM members to take up the mantle and work to build on the great work that has been achieved so far. Please note that the committee collaboration mostly takes place online and there is no expectation to volunteer in-person.  
 The posts available for election are:  
 Vice Chair and Chair Designate  – The Vice Chair supports the Chair, arranges committee meetings, and records and circulates committee discussions and actions. The Vice Chair is also the Chair Designate and is expected to take over as the new Chair the following year.  
 The Chair provides leadership and a focus for the group and supports all committee endeavours. The Chair is responsible for leading committee meetings, coordinating responses to emails sent to the IMA ECM email mailbox, and acts as direct liaison with the IMA Council and Secretariat.” The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Vice Chair and Chair Designate, 1 year as Chair, and 1 year as Immediate Past Chair.   
 Event Leader Designate  – The Event Leader Designate shadows and assists the Event Leader in the development of new and existing events for the ECM community.The Event Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Event Leader the following year. The Event Leader is responsible for supporting the leadership of our ECM subgroup to coordinate event organisation over the year. The role is to come up with new ideas for events, connect with maths communities to identify volunteers to support in sessions and facilitate events.  The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Event Leader Designate and 1 year as Event Leader.   
 Engagement Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Engagement Leader Designate shadows and assists the Engagement Leader. The Engagement Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Engagement Leader the following year.  
 The Engagement Leader’s role is to encourage ECM members to participate more actively with the IMA through the promotion of ECM events, encouraging the upgrade of membership and gaining Chartered designation, or encouraging engagement at the local IMA branch level if available. In addition, the Engagement Leader is involved in coordinating the Committee’s communication channels such as regular updates in Mathematics Today, and supporting the development and curation of engagement channels. The total time in the committee is 2 years: 1 year as Engagement Leader Designate and 1 year as Engagement Leader.   
 EDI Leader Designate (New Post)  – The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate shadows and assists the Diversity and Inclusion Leader. The Diversity and Inclusion Leader Designate is expected to take over as the new Diversity and Inclusion Leader at the end of the 2 year term of the current Diversity and Inclusion Leader (February 2026).  
 The Diversity and Inclusion leader’s role is to ensure the actions of the ECM committee are inline with the wider IMA diversity and inclusion activities. They are to provide oversight on how ECM committee actions may be best implemented to promote Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, and to make sure that any EDI concerns are appropriately addressed. They are to suggest ways the ECM committee can better engage with, and encourage, ECMs from more diverse backgrounds to follow mathematics as a career, become involved with the IMA, and become involved with the ECM committee. The  Diversity and Inclusion  l eader liaises with the IMA’s diversity champion, ECM events leader, and ECM engagement leader to achieve these aims. They also feedback directly to the IMA diversity champion thoughts that the ECM committee has to improve diversity and inclusion in the ECM population, and the IMA as a whole.  The total time in the committee is 3 years: 1 year as Diversity and Inclusion Leader and 2 years as Diversity and Inclusion Leader.   
 To put forward a self-nomination for this year’s ECM Committee, please send a short biography¹ and a paragraph outlining which role you are applying for and why you feel you would be a good fit for this position. For reference, you may wish to look at the role outlines and biographies of the current committee on the ECM Committee webpage  . If you would like further information, perhaps about a particular role or the commitment required, please email ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 The deadline for nominations is 23:59 on Wednesday 8th January 2025  . All ECM members who hold an IMA membership of any grade (e.g. Member, Associate Member, Student Member) are eligible, so submit your nominations ASAP! The election period will then run from 13-24 January 2025, during which time all self-nominations received for the above posts will be circulated. IMA ECM members will be eligible to vote for those who they believe best fit these posts. Results are expected to be finalised early in the new year, so that the new committee will be ready to take over by Monday 3 February 2025.  
 Please send nominations to ecm@ima.org.uk  .  
 We follow the IMA Diversity Statement, and endeavour to create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere at the committee, with a diverse range of participants. Applicants from groups which are under-represented in the mathematical sciences are particularly encouraged.  
 ¹ By submitting a biography for consideration, you give your consent for it to be used in emails as part of the election process, and in print and on the website should you be successfully elected. Should you be elected a photograph (High-resolution preferred) will also be requested, and used in print and on the website.

 Call for Full  Papers   

 India HCI 2025 is the 16th edition of the international conference series on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Sponsored by the HCI Professionals Association of India and in cooperation with ACM’s special interest group on computer-human interaction (SIGCHI), India HCI brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas that include traditional graphical & web user interfaces, tangible & ubiquitous computing, virtual & augmented reality, multimedia, new input & output devices, computer games, privacy, security, visualization, health, accessibility and aging, designing for children with and for special needs, user modeling, engineering interactive systems, ICT for development, CSCW, Explainable Human Centric AI (XAI) and more. India HCI provides a special spotlight on papers that are relevant to South Asia, including those related to culture, language, socio-economic situations, and the industry from the region. The intimate size, single track, and comfortable surroundings make this conference an ideal opportunity to exchange research results and implementation experiences.   
 Submissions are sought that describe original, unpublished work generally in the field of HCI. India HCI uses an anonymous submission process (similar to CHI) for paper submissions. Please consult the India HCI ‘25 Author’s Guide for information on the ACM Paper Format (also mentioned below) and conference policies on previous and simultaneous publications. To preserve anonymity during review, the authors must remove their names and affiliations from the masthead. If authors have conducted relevant prior work, they must cite it appropriately, while also referring to this work in third person. Authors can revise their submissions based on the reviews they receive, prior to submitting their camera-ready manuscripts. Until the camera-readies have been checked off by the program committee, these must be considered conditionally accepted.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the India HCI 2025 Conference Proceedings.   
 To submit, see the   India HCI Electronic Submission site.     

 Conference Theme   

 This year’s conference theme is  “Transhumanism: Improving human condition through technology”  which aims to highlight emerging technologies in HCI that focus on   
 Understanding humans 
  Enabling humans 
  Augmenting humans 
  Replacing humans 
  Being humans

 Focus and Scope of the Conference   

 Solutions that address various societal challenges, focusing on the social impact of HCI interventions in diverse contexts 
  User studies that engage qualitative or quantitative research methods and/or offer critical perspectives on technology design, deployment, and/or use. 
  Engineering interactive systems design, ubiquitous computing (including wearables), social software, ICT for development (ICTD), and computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW). 
  Innovative user interfaces for complex interaction contexts or challenging applications. Examples include managing large, complex information sets, usable privacy and security, multi-user interaction, crowdsourcing, automotive user experiences and in-vehicle interactions (devices and interface automation, instrumentation evaluation, interactive systems, benchmarking driver performance, and behaviour), or techniques that span devices distributed in time and space. 
  Breakthrough user experiences leveraging techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, speech processing, networking, or human perception and cognition. 
  Innovative software architectures, design tools, toolkits, programming systems, and development environments that support the development and use of the above technologies in user interfaces. 

 Length and Format   

 Paper Length  :  To be considered Full Papers, contributions should be more than six pages long (single column template). There is no hard page limit, but long papers without a proportional contribution are more likely to be rejected. Previous papers (if converted to the new ACM single-column format) would have run 14-18 pages in length.   
 Videos  : Videos accompanying submissions can be submitted through the India HCI EasyChair Electronic Submission Site as supplementary material (max 100 MB in size). Although papers must stand on their own, submitted videos will be available to reviewers as supporting material. Authors should note that no specific guidelines are given for developing a video. Videos are viewed only as supporting material, and authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to prepare a more polished final video presentation for inclusion in the proceedings and as supplemental material in the ACM Digital Library. Authors should note that videos too need to maintain anonymity for the review process. Authors are free to update the video once their submission is accepted, if they wish to disclose themselves in the videos.   
 When submitting your video for review, please encode your video in a format that works across as many platforms as possible without the installation of additional codecs. Please note that the total aggregate size for a submission must not exceed 100 MBytes (including all documents and additional material).   
 Reviewing process  : Each paper will be subjected to rigorous review by two Associate Chairs (from the program committee) and two external reviewers (experts in the area that are not on the committee). Contact authors will be sent the initial reviews for their papers by August 1. Authors will have an opportunity to submit a 500-word rebuttal to answer questions or clarify misunderstandings of reviewers by August 11. The final decision for accepting or rejecting a paper will be done in a PC meeting, after which the authors will be notified of the decisions.   
 All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the papers committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready draft of the paper. The primary author of each accepted paper will receive detailed instructions on how to submit a final, publication-ready version of the paper. The paper will not be formally accepted to India HCI until authors revise it and submit a final draft for approval by the programme committee. Some submissions may be asked to undergo a more intense shepherding process in order to bring them to the standard required for India HCI. The deadline for submitting the “camera ready” version after all changes will be September 10. Additionally, at least one author of each paper needs to register for the conference by this date.   
 Paper Format:  All authors should submit manuscripts in the ACM Paper Format using Microsoft Word Template, LaTeX Template, or Overleaf. [Please note that the Microsoft Word Template contains invisible meta-tags related to the paper format and structure. While writing the paper authors are requested to add their content without altering any format and structure of the template.]
