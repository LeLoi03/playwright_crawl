 Conference Venue  
 The conference will be hosted in hotel City in the heart of Maribor, a beautiful city with the oldest vine in the world  . The district of Lent is the centre of social life in Maribor, including restaurants, cafes, stunning architecture and a myriad of ways to relax with well-known spas scattered around the city.  
 Maribor is a beautiful city with the oldest vine in the world  . It was voted third in the list of best places to travel in Europe in 2023  and was chosen as the best European destination to visit in autumn 2024  . Visiting the city will give you a great opportunity to enjoy Slovenia, one of the top 5 countries  of the most desirable destinations for 2014 and the best European region of gastronomy  in 2021.  
 Maribor is the capital of the Štajerska region and the second-largest city in Slovenia. At the same time, it is pleasantly small and lodged in the wonderful nature of Pohorje on the one side and wine-growing hills on the other, with the river Drava wending its way through it. It has one of the largest and oldest classic wine cellars in Europe – it boasts an area of 20,000 m2 and 2.5 kilometres long underground tunnels, which lead you into a wonderful world full of the tastes of wine! It was the European capital of culture in 2012. Maribor hosts FIS ski world cup for women, known as Golden Fox.

  HISTORY 

  The 17th NASA Formal Methods Symposium  
 NFM 2025  
 William & Mary, Computer Science Department  
 Williamsburg, Virginia, USA  
 June 11-13, 2025  

  Symposium Theme  
 The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry requires advanced technologies to address their specification, design, verification, validation, and certification. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry, with the goal of identifying challenges and providing solutions towards achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of this symposium is on formal techniques for software and system assurance for applications in space, aviation, robotics, and other NASA-relevant critical systems.  
 Topics of Interest  
 Advances in Formal Methods – Formal verification, model checking, and static analysis; interactive and automated theorem proving; program and specification synthesis, code transformation and generation; run-time verification and test case generation; techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods; design for verification and correct-by-design techniques; requirements generation, specification, and validation. 
  Integration of Formal Methods – Use of ML techniques in formal methods; integration of formal methods and software engineering; integration of diverse formal methods techniques; integration of formal methods with simulation, analysis, and test approaches. 
  Formal Methods in Practice – Experience reports on applications of formal methods in industry; use of formal methods in education; applications of formal methods to concurrent and distributed systems, human-machine systems, autonomous systems, and fault-detection, diagnostics, and prognostics systems. 
  Submissions  
 There are two categories of submissions: Regular papers – Up to 15 pages plus references. Regular papers describe fully developed work and complete results. 
  Short papers — Up to 6 pages plus references. Short papers describe either novel and publicly available tools, case studies detailing applications of formal methods, or new emerging ideas in the topics of interest. 
  All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not been published or submitted elsewhere. Authors of accepted papers must present their work in person at the conference.  
 NFM prohibits the use of generative AI to create the textual narrative of the paper. However, the use of generative AI to create examples (such as text, tables, graphics, and code) that support the paper is permitted, but this must be disclosed in the paper. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations need not be disclosed in the paper.  
 All submissions will be fully reviewed by members of the Program Committee. NFM is currently arranging to publish accepted regular and short papers in the Formal Methods subline of Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Authors should therefore use the LNCS style formatting described here  . Papers must be submitted in PDF format through the EasyChair submission site  .

 Proof for Industrial Systems using Neural Certificates   
 Daniel Kröning    
 Amazon Web Services and Magdalen College, Oxford, UK   

 Abstract  We introduce a novel approach to model checking software and hardware that combines machine learning and symbolic reasoning by using neural networks as formal proof certificates. We train our neural certificates from randomly generated executions of the system and we then symbolically check their validity which, upon the affirmative answer, establishes that the system provably satisfies the specification. We leverage the expressive power of neural networks to represent proof certificates and the fact that checking a certificate is much simpler than finding one. As a result, our machine learning procedure is entirely unsupervised, formally sound, and practically effective. We implemented a prototype and compared the performance of our method with the state-of-the-art academic and commercial model checkers on a set of Java programs and hardware designs written in SystemVerilog.

 Compositional Symbolic Execution for Over-approximating and Under-approximating Reasoning   
 Philippa Gardner    
 Imperial College London, UK   

 Abstract  A relatively recent challenge has been to develop symbolic-execution techniques and tools that are functionally compositional with simple function specifications that can be used in broader calling contexts. The technical break-through came with the introduction of separation logics for reasoning about partial mutable state, leading to compositional symbolic execution tools being developed in academia and industry. Many of these tools have been grounded on a formal foundation, but either the function specifications are validated with respect to the underlying symbolic semantics of the engine, with no meaning outside the tool, or there is a large gulf between the theory and the implementations of the tools. In this talk, I will introduce a formal compositional symbolic execution engine which creates and uses function specifications from an underlying separation logic and provides a sound theoretical foundation for, and indeed was partially inspired by, the Gillian platform. This is achieved by providing an axiomatic interface which describes the properties of the consume and produce functions for updating the symbolic state when calling function specifications, a technique used by VeriFast, Viper and Gillian but not previously characterised independently of the tool. A surprising property is that our semantics provides a common foundation for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning, with the difference in the underlying engine only amounting to the choice to use satisfiability or validity. We use this insight to extend the Gillian platform with incorrectness reasoning, developing automatic true bug-finding using incorrectness bi-abduction, which our engine incorporates by creating fixes from missing-resource errors. We have shown that the Gillian implementation of the consumer and producer functions satisfy the properties described by our axiomatic interface, and evaluate our new Gillian platform by using the Gillian instantiation to C. This instantiation is the first tool to support both correctness and incorrectness reasoning, as well as being grounded on a common formal compositional symbolic execution engine.  
 This talk is loosely based on the paper “Compositional Symbolic Execution for Over-approximating and Under-approximating Reasoning” by Andreas Lööw, Daniele Nantes Sobrinho, Sacha-Elie Ayoun, Caroline Cronjäger, Petar Maksimović and Philippa Gardner, ECOOP 2024, distinguished paper.  
   
  Philippa Gardner    Biography  Professor Philippa Gardner has brought scientific and mathematical method to the specification and analysis of large-scale open software systems. She has developed trustworthy mechanisations of language standards, which led to the correction of definitions and formal proofs of properties within the W3C WebAssembly formal specification. Her work includes compositional analysis techniques and well-engineered tools for both semi-automatic verification and automatic detection of true bugs in industrial and open-source software. She has also created program logics for verifying complex concurrent algorithms, resulting in tools now used by hundreds of specialist users. Her contributions represent over three decades of sustained investment, all focussed on achieving machine-proven guarantees about the safety and correctness of real, deployed software, grounded in mathematical foundations.  
 After completing her PhD thesis at Edinburgh in 1992 and holding research positions in both Edinburgh and Cambridge, Gardner became a lecturer at Imperial in 2001 and a professor in 2009. She held fellowships spanning over twenty years, including a UKRI Established Research Fellowship from 2018 to 2023 at Imperial, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2020. She won the British Computer Society Lovelace Medal in 2024.  

 A Formal Approach to Railways Interlocking Design   
 Alessandro Cimatti    
 Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy   

 Abstract  Many railways interlocking systems are still based on electromechanical solutions. They are hard to understand and costly to modify, and can be considered legacy systems. In this talk I will present the research underlying a novel process for the development of interlocking applications. The proposed methodology is able on one side to analyze and reverse-engineer legacy relay-based interlocking systems, and on the other to support the specification and verification of interlocking procedures by means of a model-based approach. Research challenges include modeling and verification of continuous-time, real-valued transition systems, automated abstraction for reverse engineering and specification mining, automated test generation, and parameterized verification.  
   
  Alessandro Cimatti    Biography  Alessandro Cimatti is the director of the Center for Digital Industry at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy. His research interests include formal verification, model checking, temporal logics, runtime verification, safety assessment, diagnosis and planning. Cimatti authored more than 250 papers in the fields of formal methods and artificial intelligence. For his fundamental works on Bounded Model Checking and on Satisfiability Modulo Theories, Cimatti has received the TACAS 2014 Most Influential Paper award, the ETAPS 2017 Test of Time award and the CAV Award in 2018 and 2021. He has been the leader of several technology transfer projects, including research projects funded by the European Union, the European Space Agency and the European Railway Agency, as well as of industrial collaborations with RFI, SAIPEM and Boeing.  

 Invited Tutorial   
 Deductive Verification of C Programs with Frama-C   
 Frédéric Loulergue    
 Université d’Orléans, France   

 Abstract  While ensuring the correctness of an implementation based on a formal functional specification provides the strongest guarantee, it can be prohibitively expensive to achieve. In practice, a combination of formal methods is commonly employed to attain an appropriate level of assurance. This includes static analyses to ensure the absence of runtime errors, deductive verification for functional correctness, and dynamic verification for components that cannot be proven through deductive verification. Frama-C is a source code analysis platform designed for the verification of large-scale programs written in ISO C source code. It offers comprehensive support for the integration of formal methods, offering users a set of plug-ins that facilitate static and dynamic analysis of safety-critical and security-critical software. Furthermore, the collaborative verification capabilities are achieved through the integration of these plug-ins on a shared kernel and their adherence to a standardized specification language known as ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language). This tutorial introduces Frama-C with a focus on the WP plug-in for deductive verification. We illustrate WP on several examples taken from Contiki, a lightweight operating system for the Internet of Things. ( Slides (PDF)  , Exercises (zip file)  )

 @WAS History  
  
 The International organization on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (@WAS) was founded in 2003 given the overwhelming success of the iiWAS series of workshops (1999, 2000) and conferences (2001-on) and the prospect of continuing the organization of these events in the forthcoming years which have encouraged some to propose the creation of a non-profit International Organization for Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (@WAS).  
  In 2003, @WAS launched another series of conferences called International Conferences on Advances in Mobile Computing and Multimedia (MoMM) held in Jakarta in conjunction with iiWAS2003 conference and was officially opened by the Minister of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia at that time. MoMM aims to provide a discussion forum for the exchange of ideas and Information by researchers, students, and professionals on the issues and challenges brought by the emerging wireless technologies for mobile and multimedia applications and services.  
 Starting in 2003, iiWAS and MoMM conferences series proceedings have been published by the Austrian computer society in its books@ocg book series. A number of reputable international journals have also agreed to publish special issues of iiWAS/MoMM conferences series.  
 @WAS had endorsed many conferences like the International Conference on Telematics Systems, Services and Applications (TSSA), the International Conference on Wireless Systems, Services and Applications (WSSA) organized by Bandung Institute of Technology which were held in Bandung, Indonesia in 2006 and 2007 and EATIS Conference (Euro American Conference on Telematics and Information Systems), which took place in Santa Martha, Columbia in 2006, in Portugal in 2007 and in Aracaju, Brazil in 2008. The aim of the latest was to actively promote academic collaboration between European and American universities.  
 In addition to fostering a forum for the exchange and communication of ideas and information among researchers, students, and professionals, @WAS, by various means such as workshops, symposium, short papers and a Master and Doctoral colloquium, have been striving to concoct a program of academic and professional excellence while giving young researchers opportunities to present their work and benefit by the experience of their peers and seniors.  
 In 2005, @WAS launched the Master and Doctoral colloquium to give PhD, Masters students and candidates the opportunity to present their work and receive a valuable feedback from the members of a committee with experienced researchers from both Academia and Industry.  
 In 2006, @WAS started the tradition of holding the Emerging Research Projects Applications Symposium (ERPAS) WAS2009 for researchers to present, discuss and defend their work-in-progress or projects preliminary results in front of an international and renowned audience of researchers and developers.  
 Starting in 2006, @WAS has expanded to run in-conjunction workshops. These workshops are dedicated to foster emerging work and applications as well as the work of young researchers. They aim at giving their participants an interactive forum of presentation and discussion. These workshops were: SIIK (Workshop on Semantic Information Integration on Knowledge Discovery) held in 2006, MoMIR (Workshop on Mobile Multimedia Information Retrieval) held in 2006, 2007, and 2009, BWCCA (Workshop on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications) held in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, SoC (Workshop on Systems-On-Chips) held in 2006, TwUC (Workshop on Trustworthy Ubiquitous Computing) held in 2006, 2007, and 2008, AIIDE (Workshop on Applications of Information Integration in Digital Ecosystems) held in 2008 and 2009, RED (Workshop on Resource Discovery) held in 2008, MoCoHeTM (Workshop on Mobile Collaborations for Hospital-based Health Care), UWA (Ubiquitous Web Applications held in 2008, IST-AWSN (Workshop on Intelligent Systems Techniques for Ad hoc and Wireless Sensor Networks) held in 2009, HCI4UCE (Workshop on HCI for the Ubiquitous Computing Environment held in 2009.  
  In 2008, iiWAS celebrates its tenth anniversary. iiWAS2008 is hosted by the Johannes Kepler University Linz. There have been a number of important achievements to mark the tenth anniversary of iiWAS. iiWAS, was for the first time, endorsed by the ACM SIGWEB. MoMM was endorsed by ACM SIGMM. The proceedings of both conferences were published by the ACM and available in its Digital Library. It has become a high visibility, high-impact, international conference.  
  In 2009, @WAS hosted the inaugural Web Applications Competition. The competition was to build a web application, which is accessible publicly through a URL. The application should be developed to facilitate e-applications such as e-learning, e-government, e-communities, e-Business etc.  
 @WAS Executive Steering committee decided in 2009 to create @WAS Decennial Award to acknowledge the continuing contributions of individuals to the @WAS organization and to the iiWAS and MoMM conference series. The award was conferred the on Professor Doctor Gabriele Kotsis, the vice rector for research of the Johannes Kepler University Linz in recognition of her outstanding scientific, didactic and organizational contributions to the @WAS organisation and the iiWAS and MoMM Conferences.

 Call For Papers  Tom Duhamel    2024-09-11T06:19:57-04:00  T-BIOM Call For Papers  
 IEEE Biometrics Council is pleased to announce the launch of IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (T-BIOM)  . It will be a quarterly Transactions and the first issue will be published in January 2019. T-BIOM  publishes original articles on all aspects of biometrics (i.e. recognizing people through their physiological or behavioral traits such as face, fingerprint, iris, and signature), including theory, applications, systems, and surveys. Biometrics are personal identity characteristics where people are recognized by who they are rather than by what they own; behavior is the typical movement of a person that is unique and identifiable; identity science underlies the application of biometrics. Papers focusing on ramifications of these areas will also be welcomed, such as security of such systems, standards for their deployment, and new architectures and systems are also welcomed. Broad topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Biometric modalities | Management of human identities using traditional behavioral and physiological characteristics (biometric modalities) including Face, Fingerprint, Iris, Periocular, Palmprint, Gait, Ear, and Voice. 
  Emerging biometrics including social and behavioral biometrics, gesture based biometrics, keystroke, vascular, knuckle, and soft information/biometrics such as quality, age, gender, kinship, social context, and biographic analysis 
  Multibiometrics including fusion approaches 
  Novel biometric sensors 
  Person re-identification 
  Detection, tracking, identification, and de-identification in surveillance 
  Mobile biometrics, active authentication 
  Novel (challenging) biometrics databases, protocol and benchmarking, large scale evaluation, confidence interval estimation, and performance modeling and prediction 
  Pattern classification and machine learning, including deep learning, algorithms for biometrics and identity science 
  Behavior analysis related to biometrics and identity science: | Biometrics and human behavior analysis, human activity understanding, and behavior modeling 
  Modeling the interplay of behavioral modalities with applications in biometrics and security 
  Security of biometrics and identity systems: | Adversarial attacks on biometric systems 
  Biometrics presentation attack detection, template protection, template update, and data protection 
  Applications: | Forensic analysis in identity and activity 
  Applications of biometrics and identity in privacy preserving computing, user centric security, usable privacy and security, social and criminal network inference, privacy protection and enhancement 
  Applications of biometrics in law enforcement and cybercrime, finance, smart-cards, border control, healthcare, civil registry, access control, securing documents, fraud detection, cloud, and entertainment.

 Research  

 The main focus of the BioML lab is the development and enhancement of biometric recognition systems. We work with different biometric modalities  , such as face, iris, fingerprint, finger vein, or handwritten signatures, as well as with combinations of those in multi-biometric  schemes. Besides trying to increase the recognition accuracy and computational efficiency of the systems, we focus on other relevant aspects of this research area. Preserving the privacy  of the subjects is at the core of our research, for which we develop biometric template protection schemes in compliance with the GDPR and relevant ISO standards, following the Privacy-by-Design principle. Furthermore, the detection of several forms of attacks  on biometric systems (e.g., Presentation Attacks or Morphing Attacks) is key to increasing the security and reliability of the systems. Last but not least, we believe that higher explainability  and transparency  will allow further acceptance and deployment of biometric recognition.  
 A deep understanding of machine learning  methods and cryptographic primitives  allows us to pursue our research goals.  
 Our group co-organises and participates in international academic conferences such as IJCB and BIOSIG  , and contributes both to the European Association for Biometrics (EAB)  and the international standardisation in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC37  .

 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research.  
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.  
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

  Request for Proposals – IJCB 2025 

 The IEEE Biometrics Council and IAPR TC-4 invite proposals to host the 2025 edition of the International Joint Conference on Biometrics, preferably around September-October 2025 in Asia/Australia. Proposals from other regions are welcome.  
 IEEE IJCB is the premier international forum for research in biometrics and related technologies, combining two major, the IEEE Biometrics Theory, Applications, and Systems (BTAS) conference and the International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), and is made possible through a special agreement between the by the IEEE Biometrics Council and the IAPR TC-4. IJCB is intended to have a broad scope, including advances in the fields of signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, statistical/mathematical techniques, ethical and privacy frameworks, system security, databases, and legal policy, that are relevant to biometrics.  
 The 2022 edition of IJCB was organised in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and the 2023 edition in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The conference is financially sponsored by the IEEE Biometrics Council and technically co-sponsored by IAPR TC-4.  
 Important Dates:  
 Draft proposal for initial feedback by | September 1, 2023 | . 
  Full proposals by | September 15, 2023 | . 
  Evaluation results will be returned by | October 5, 2023 | . 
  In your proposal, please include the following information:  
 Organisers: tentative general chairs, program chairs, and other key roles, with specific names where possible, proposed names otherwise. Please identify the lead general and program chairs, and describe past organisation and IJCB-related experience for all organisers. 
  The conference time, location and venue: the proposed dates, the city, the specific conference location and facilities, estimated costs of the venue, suggested hotel(s) and their cost(s), accessibility for travel and example travel costs, public transportation and access from nearest airports. If there is a local biometrics community, please mention. 
  Hybrid/virtual attendance: plans about allowing virtual participation, in case this is considered. We strongly urge you to consider a fully in-person conference. 
  Conference plans: plans for the program (technical program, special sessions, invited speakers, reception and banquet, etc.), events beyond the main conference (workshops, tutorials, tours, etc.). What is planned to be similar or different from previous IJCB conferences?

  Paper Submission 

 Paper submission instructions and guidelines  
  
 Submit your paper at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCB2023     
 The submission system will be opened on April 2nd, 2023.  
 The LaTeX / Word templates for the paper submission are available here:  
 Latex template 
  Word template 
  Page limit:  
 A paper can be up to 8 pages including figures and tables, plus an unlimited number of additional pages for references only.  
 Supplementary:  
 Authors can submit one supplementary file. The size should not exceed 100 MB (maximum allowable by CMT)  and can be in doc, pdf or zip format.  
 Dual submission policy:  
 During the IJCB 2023 reviewing process, the paper should not be submitted to or be under review in any peer-reviewed venue  including conferences, workshops or journals. All submitted papers will be checked with a plagiarism detection tool.  
 Double-blind review policy:  
 The reviewing process will be double blind.  
 Remove author names, affiliations, email addresses, etc. from the paper. 
  Remove personal acknowledgments. 
  When reporting experiments on data collected in your lab, consider stating this as “This experiment was conducted using data acquired at Mars University”. Do not state this as “This experiment was conducted using data that was collected in our labs at Mars University”. 
  When citing your own work, ensure that the narrative does not divulge your identity. 
  Simultaneous submissions to arxiv | without mentioning IJCB | are allowed. 
  Dataset requirement:  
 For existing public datasets, the authors are strongly encouraged to state if they are still available for others to reproduce experimental results.  
 For new datasets introduced in the submission involving human subjects, the authors are strongly suggested to ensure the datasets have been ethically, legitimately and legally acquired and stored. Any approvals already obtained from an Institutional Review Board (IRB, or equivalent) are more than enough to demonstrate this, and it is encouraged to state such approvals in the paper. However, please do not submit your approval files in the submission since this may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. A sentence stating the approvals, or a paragraph demonstrating your ethical considerations in collecting the dataset, in either the main paper or the supplementary material, is enough. Besides, it is strongly encouraged that the new datasets will be made available to others to contribute to the biometrics research community and allow reproducibility.  
 For private datasets, either existing or new, are allowed for experiments. However, for dataset papers claiming new dataset contributions, the dataset must be made publicly available by the camera-ready deadline; otherwise the claim of new dataset contributions will not be counted by reviewers.  
 Conflict of interest:  
 Papers co-authored by General or Program Chairs will be reviewed with Chair-conflicts enabled in the reviewing platform to avoid any conflict of interest.  
 Registration and presentation requirement:  
 Papers accepted at the conference must be presented by one of the authors, and at least one of the authors must register at the standard registration rate before the early registration deadline. Each author registration applies towards only one paper. If an accepted paper is not registered and/or not presented at the conference, it will be withdrawn from the proceedings and from IEEE Xplore. IJCB2023 reserves the right to exclude a paper from publication if the paper is not presented (no-show) at the conference.  
 Authors may not delegate presentation of their paper to a non-author in attendance.  
 Authors are required by IEEE to transfer copyrights for any papers placed in Xplore. This is performed at the time final versions are submitted for production. If a paper is withdrawn from the proceedings, copyright will revert to the authors.

 In the future people will collaborate more and more with machines to solve complex problems using AI techniques. Such a collaboration requires adequate communication, trust, clarity and understanding. eXplainalbe AI (XAI) aims at addressing such challenges by combining the best of symbolic AI and Machine Learning including neural models, evolutionary computing and fuzzy systems. Such topic has been studied for years by all different communities of AI, with different definitions, evaluation metrics, motivations and results. In addition to technology, this involves social and legal issues as well as a wide range of real-world applications and domains. Both interpretability by design methods and post-hoc methods for explaining complex models have been proposed and investigated. Research has also redirected its emphasis on the structure of explanations and human-centered Artificial Intelligence, recognizing that the ultimate users of interactive technologies are humans.

 IJCAI 2025 Call for papers (Main Track)  
  
 Important Dates (all times are 23:59 Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)   
   
  Abstract submission deadline  : January 16, 2025  
  Author information and Full paper submission deadline (including Appendix and resubmission information):  January 23, 2025  
  Summary reject notification  : March 7, 2025  
  Author response period  : April 6-9, 2025  
  Paper notification  : April 28, 2025  
  Conference (Montreal)  : Saturday, August 16 to Friday, August 22, 2025.  
  Satellite event (Guangzhou)  : Thursday, August 28 to Sunday, August 31, 2025.  
 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research.  
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.  
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

 IJCAI 2025 Call for papers (Main Track)  
  
 Important Dates (all times are 23:59 Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)   
   
  Abstract submission deadline  : January 16, 2025  
  Author information and Full paper submission deadline (including Appendix and resubmission information):  January 23, 2025  
  Summary reject notification  : March 7, 2025  
  Author response period  : April 6-9, 2025  
  Paper notification  : April 28, 2025  
  Conference (Montreal)  : Saturday, August 16 to Friday, August 22, 2025.  
  Satellite event (Guangzhou)  : Thursday, August 28 to Sunday, August 31, 2025.  
 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research.  
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.  
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline.

 List of Topics  
  ------------------  
  Just as coding assistants have dramatically increased productivity for coding tasks over the last two years, researchers in the NLP community have begun to explore methods and opportunities ahead for creating scientific assistants that can help with the process of scientific discovery and increase the pace at which novel discoveries are made. Over the last year, language models have been used to create problem-general scientific discovery assistants that are not restricted to narrow problem domains or formulations. Such applications hold opportunities for assisting researchers in broad domains, or scientific reasoning more generally. Beyond assisting, a growing body of work has begun to focus on the prospect of creating largely autonomous scientific discovery agents that can make novel discoveries with minimal human intervention.  
 These recent developments highlight the possibility of rapidly accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in the near term. Given the influx of researchers into this expanding field, this workshop proposes to serve as a vehicle for bringing together a diverse set of perspectives from this quickly expanding subfield, helping to disseminate the latest results, standardize evaluation, foster collaboration between groups, and allow discussing aspirational goals for 2025 and beyond. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  
 ***Literature-based Discovery:*** This topic focuses on using existing scientific articles to facilitate novel discoveries, by finding “undiscovered public knowledge’’, conditioning novel studies based on existing work, or easing the search and reading process. Systems that read the literature at scale may ultimately help us come up with research ideas that are more novel, broader in scope, and operationalized in more useful experiments.  
 ***Agent-centered Approaches:*** Agent models are being used to form end-to-end scientific discovery pipelines, with separate agents taking on different roles, such as hypothesis generation, execution, and reviewing experiments.  
 ***Automated Experiment Execution:*** Agents that can automatically execute experiments require a large number of pragmatic skills that emerging benchmarks are beginning to evaluate, including downloading data, writing code, and interfacing with apps.  
 ***Automated Replication:*** Science is generally suffering a “reproducibility crisis”, and NLP is not immune to this, with (for example) 59% of reproducibility attempts finding worse performance than papers originally reported. Automated reproducibility attempts to read original papers, Github repositories, and instructions, to replicate experiments fully automatically.  
 ***Data-driven Discovery:*** Reading existing papers and combining or re-analyzing existing datasets frequently allows for novel data-driven discoveries without having to collect new data empirically, and may yield inexpensive novel discoveries.  
 ***Discovery in Virtual Environments:*** Virtual environments, including text-based simulations, allow training and evaluating agents at aspects of the scientific discovery process in simulated proxy tasks without running physical experiments, which are costly and time consuming.  
 ***Discovery with Humans in the Loop:*** How can we make the textual knowledge from literature best engage with humans in the discovery process, through various interfaces, processes, and surfaces?  
 ***Assistants for Scientific Writing:*** Language models can be used as assistants in the scientific dissemination process, either as planners for writing text such as academic articles, or blog posts intended for public consumption.  
 Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------  
  We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular archival workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the OpenReview website set up for this workshop ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.  
 ***Archival, regular workshop papers:*** Authors should submit a paper up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome), with unlimited pages for references, following the ACL author guidelines. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers.  
  Non-archival regular workshop papers: This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date.  
 ***Non-archival cross-submissions:*** We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that have already appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the AISD audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.  
  In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.  
 Note to authors: While you submit your paper through OpenReview ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ), please select the “Submission Type” properly based on the guidelines.  
 For questions about the submission guidelines, please contact workshop organizers via aisd-organizers  [at] googlegroups.com

 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

 ICB/IJCB Conference  
   
 The IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)  is sponsored by IAPR-TC4 (Technical Committee on Biometrics – TC4, International Association for Pattern Recognition), is the premier forum for the presentation of new advances and research results in the fields of biometrics. ICB, formed in 2006 by merging AVBPA (Audio- and Video-based Person Authentication), ICBA (International Conference on Biometric Authentication) and other biometric workshops, has established itself as a leading international conference in biometrics. The conference will have a broad scope and invites papers that advance biometric technologies, sensor design, feature extraction and matching algorithms, analysis of security and privacy, and evaluation of social impact of biometrics technology. Topics of interest include all areas of current Biometrics research and applications.  
 The International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)  combines two major biometrics research conferences, the International Conference on Biometrics (ICB) and the Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS) conference. The blending of these two conferences is through a special agreement between the IAPR TC-4 and the IEEE Biometrics Council. IJCB presents an exciting event for the entire worldwide biometrics research community.  
   The logo files of IJCB   and related materials are in IJCB-logo-final-IEEE-approved.zip  . You are welcome to use them in IJCB-related designs.

  Conference (Montreal)  : Saturday, August 16 to Friday, August 22, 2025.  
  Satellite event (Guangzhou)  : Thursday, August 28 to Sunday, August 31, 2025.  
 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research.  
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.  
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.  
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  
 Contact for questions not answered in the call  : pcchair@2025.ijcai.org  
 Summary   
 Papers must be no longer than | 9 | pages in total: | 7 | pages for the body of the paper and | 2 | pages for references. All authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review. 
  Two-phase reviewing: Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers that advance beyond Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2, during which authors will have the opportunity to submit a response. 
  Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline. Paper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below. 
  Generative AI models, including ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2025. If authors use an LLM in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of the entire submission. We encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. 
  General Information   
 Page limit  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper and 2  pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.  
 Authors commit to reviewing  : By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2025 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2025 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, senior area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
 Simplified procedure for resubmission information  : Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so. If the IJCAI submission significantly differs from the originally rejected submission, the authors may submit it as a new submission.  
 Contribution statement  : For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.  
 Selection Process   
 Selection criteria  : Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.  
 Summary rejects  : The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.  
 Full paper review  : Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs). Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC).  
 Author response  : The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to SAC, AC, SPC, and PCs.  
 Participation in the conference  . At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to pcchair@2025.ijcai.org to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou. Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via pcchair@2025.ijcai.org. Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.  
 Ethics policy and ethics statement  : IJCAI is committed to the highest standards of research integrity. Submissions must adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including the responsible use of datasets (respecting privacy, copyright, and informed consent) and mitigating potential societal harms (such as risks to safety, and issues related to discrimination and bias).  
 Consistent with the 2023 and 2024 editions of the conference, IJCAI 2025 will implement a streamlined ethics review policy. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we anticipate that the primary approach to addressing ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these concerns and proposes strategies for their mitigation.  
 Authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns.  
 Conflict of interest policy  : All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2025 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policies, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.  
 Confidentiality policy  : All submissions will be handled with strict confidentiality until their publication date.  
 Submission Process   
 Formatting guidelines  : The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2024.  
 Submission site  : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025  
 Mandatory abstract submission  : The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2025 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.  
 Author Information  : Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.) All authors must fill out the author information form on the submission site by the Author Information deadline. Providing accurate author details is essential for managing conflicts of interest during the review process. Submissions may be rejected without review if any co-author fails to register and submit the necessary information.  
 Submission limit  : IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8  submissions to IJCAI 2025.  
 Keywords  : When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.  
 Copyright  : IJCAI 2025 will be conducted in accordance with IJCAI guidelines. All accepted papers will be published exclusively by IJCAI, with IJCAI retaining the copyright.  
 Submission Requirements   
 Paper format  : Papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2025 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the IJCAI 2025 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.  
 Paper length  : Papers must be no longer than 9  pages in total: 7  pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2  additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.  
 Supplementary material  : Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Reviewers may choose to consult the technical appendix at their discretion.  
 Anonymity  : From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for IJCAI 2025 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was not anonymous, the authors must anonymize the submission to IJCAI. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.  
 Preprints  : The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Reproducibility  : Authors must follow the reproducibility  guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.  
 Ethics Statement  : Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.  
 Dual submissions  : IJCAI 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of IJCAI 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  
 Note that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2025 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2025 since the ICLR 2025 notifications are before the IJCAI 2025 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2025 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2025 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews.

 End-to-End Rule Induction from Raw Sequence Inputs  

 ICLR 2025 Conference Submission3816 Authors

 Keywords :  Neuro-Symbolic Methods, Interpretability, Inductive Logic Programming    
 Abstract :  Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.

 GeoILP: A Synthetic Dataset to Guide Large-Scale Rule Induction  

 ICLR 2025 Conference Submission9564 Authors    
   
  27 Sept 2024 (modified: 02 Dec 2024)   ICLR 2025 Conference Submission   Everyone   Revisions    BibTeX    CC BY 4.0     

 Keywords :  inductive logic programming, rule induction, dataset    
 Abstract :  Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a machine learning approach aiming to learn explanatory rules from data. While existing ILP systems can successfully solve small-scale tasks, large-scale applications with various language biases are rarely explored. Besides, it is crucial for a large majority of current ILP systems to require expert-defined language bias, which hampers the development of ILP towards broader utilizations. In this paper, we introduce GeoILP, a large-scale synthetic dataset of diverse ILP tasks involving numerous aspects of language bias. % including complex rule forms, high deduction complexity, and more realistic assumptions. The ILP tasks are built from geometry problems, at the level from textbook exercise to regional International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), with the help of a deduction engine. These problems are elaborately selected to cover all challenging language biases, such as recursion, predicate invention, and high arity. Experimental results show that no existing method can solve GeoILP tasks. In addition, along with classic symbolic-form data, we provide image-form data to boost the development of the joint learning of neural perception and symbolic rule induction.

  Rough Sets and Current Trends in Soft Computing 

 Before the advent of fuzzy and rough sets, some authors in the 1960s studied three-valued logics and pairs of sets with a meaning similar to those we can encounter nowadays in modern theories such as rough sets, decision theory and granular computing. We revise these studies using the modern terminology and making reference to the present literature. Finally, we put forward some future directions of investigation.   

 General Negations for Residuated Fuzzy Logics    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.13-22 

 Involutive residuated negations are usually considered in resi\-duated fuzzy logics and they are also based on continuous triangular norms. This paper introduces a generalization of these negations using flexible conjunctors, several properties of them and the corresponding disjunctive dual operators associated with the conjunctor.   

 Improving the β-Precision and OWA Based Fuzzy Rough Set Models: Definitions, Properties and Robustness Analysis    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.23-34 

 Since the early 1990s, many authors have studied fuzzy rough set models and their application in machine learning and data reduction. In this work, we adjust the β-precision and the ordered weighted average based fuzzy rough set models in such a way that the number of theoretical properties increases. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of the new models a-β-PREC and a-OWA to noisy data and compare them to a general implicator-conjunctor-based fuzzy rough set model.   

 Nearest Neighbour-Based Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.35-46 

 Research in the area of fuzzy-rough set theory and its application to various areas of learning have generated great interest in recent years. In particular, there has been much work in the area of feature or attribute selection. Indeed, as the number of dimensions increases, the number of data objects required in order to generate accurate models increases exponentially. Thus, feature selection (FS) has become an increasingly necessary step in model learning. The use of fuzzy-rough sets as dataset pre-processors offers much in the way of flexibility, however the underlying complexity of the subset evaluation metric often presents a problem and can result in a great deal of potentially unnecessary computational effort. This paper proposes two different novel ways to address this problem using a neighbourhood approximation step in order to alleviate the processing overhead and reduce the complexity of the evaluation metric. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that much computational effort can be avoided, and as a result the efficiency of the FS process can be improved considerably.   

 Some Fundamental Laws of Partial First-Order Logic Based on Set Approximations    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  RSCTC 2014 

 The authors show that a very general framework of set approximation can be the set-theoretical base of semantics of a partial first-order logic. The most general problem is what happens if in the semantics of first-order logic one uses the approximations of sets as semantic values of predicate parameters instead of sets given by their total interpretation in order to determine the truth values of formulas? The authors show some unexpected properties connected with logical constants directly. The goal of the investigation is to show the possible connections between the result of different approximative and exact evaluation of formulas – or the lack of them. At the end, the authors present the practical example, in which we can see the discussed behavior of approximation.

 Aristotle’s Syllogisms in Logical Semantics Relying on Optimistic, Average and Pessimistic Membership Functions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  RSCTC 2014 

 After giving the precise partial first-order logical semantics relying on different membership functions, the notion of decision driven consequence relations with parameters is introduced. Aristotle’s valid syllogisms of the first figure are investigated. The author shows what kind of decisions is necessary and how parameters have to be chosen in order that a consequence relation remains valid.

 Fuzzy Sets for a Declarative Description of Multi-adjoint Logic Programming    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.71-82 

 A powerful research line in the design of declarative languages consists in the introduction of expressive resources with a fuzzy taste on their cores, in order to provide comfortable computational constructs for easily solving real-world scientific/engineering problems. Into the fuzzy logic programming arena, the so-called multi-adjoint approach (MALP in brief) has emerged as an interesting paradigm for which our research group has developed during the last years the \(\mathcal F \mathcal L \mathcal O \mathcal P \mathcal E \mathcal R\) programming environment and the FuzzyXPath application in the field of the semantic web. Since the practicality of declarative languages is strongly dependent of their theoretical foundations, here we focus on topics related with the declarative semantics of the MALP framework. So, under an innovative point of view relying on fuzzy sets theory, in this paper we re-formulate in a very simple and elegant way our original model theory-based notions of least fuzzy Herbrand model and (fuzzy) correct answer. Apart for simplifying the proofs relating these concepts, our results are nicely strengthened with homologous ones in the field of pure logic programming, but largely surpassing them thanks to the fuzzy dimension of the MALP language.   

 Multi Threshold FRPS: A New Approach to Fuzzy Rough Set Prototype Selection    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.83-91 

 Prototype Selection (PS) is the preprocessing technique for K nearest neighbor classification that selects a subset of instances before classification takes place. The most accurate state-of-the-art PS method is Fuzzy Rough Prototype Selection (FRPS), which assesses the quality of the instances by means of the fuzzy rough positive region and automatically selects a good threshold to decide if instances should be retained in the prototype subset. In this paper we introduce a new PS method based on FRPS, called Multi Threshold FRPS (MT-FRPS) . Instead of determining one threshold against which the quality of every instance is compared, we consider one threshold for each class. We evaluate MT-FRPS on 40 standard classification datasets and compare it against MT-FRPS and the state-of-the-art PS methods and show that MT-FRPS improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art PS methods.   

 Measurable Structures of ${\cal I}$ -Fuzzy Rough Sets    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.92-99 

 In this paper, dual fuzzy rough approximation operators determined by a fuzzy implication operator \({\cal I}\) in infinite universes of discourse are first introduced. Measurable structures of \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough sets are then discussed. It is shown that the family of all definable sets in an \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough set algebra derived from a reflexive fuzzy space forms a σ-fuzzy algebra. In a finite universe of discourse, the family of all definable sets in a serial \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough set algebra is a fuzzy algebra, and conversely if a σ-fuzzy algebra is generated by a crisp algebra, then there must exist an \({\cal I}\)-fuzzy rough set algebra such that the family of all definable sets is exactly the given σ-fuzzy algebra.

  pp.100-108 

 In multi-label learning task, each sample may be assigned with one or more labels. Moreover multi-label classification tasks are often characterized by high-dimensional and inconsistent attributes. Fuzzy rough sets are an effective mathematic tool for dealing with inconsistency and attribute reduction. In this work, we discuss multi-label attribute reduction within the frame of fuzzy rough sets. We analyze the definitions of fuzzy lower approximation in multi-label classification and give several improvements of the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, the attribute dependency function is defined to evaluate condition attributes. A multi-label attribute reduction algorithm is constructed based on the dependency function. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.   

 Mining Significant Granular Association Rules for Diverse Recommendation    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.120-127 

 Granular association rule is a new technique to build recommender systems. The quality of a rule is often evaluated by the confidence measure, namely the probability that users purchase or rate certain items. Unfortunately, the confidence-based approach tends to suggest popular items to users, and novel patterns are often ignored. In this paper, we propose to mine significant granular association rules for diverse and novel recommendation. Generally, a rule is significant if the recommended items favor respective users more than others; while a recommender is diverse if it recommends different items to different users. We define two sets of measures to evaluate the quality of a rule as well as a recommender. Then we propose a significance-based approach seeking top-k significant rules for each user. Results on the MovieLens dataset show that the new approach provides more significant and diverse recommendations than the confidence-based one.   

 Incremental Three-Way Decisions with Incomplete Information    
   
 Conference Paper

  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.128-135 

 The theory of rough sets proposed a framework for approximating concepts by three pair-wise disjoint regions, namely, the positive, boundary and negative regions. Rules generated by the three regions form three-way decision rules, which are acceptance, deferment and rejection decisions. The periodic updating of decision rules is required due to the dynamic nature of decision systems. Incremental learning technique is an effective way to solve the problem of dynamic data, which is capable of updating the learning results incrementally without recalculation in the total data set from scratch. In this paper, we present a methodology for incremental updating three-way decisions with incomplete information when the object set varies through the time.   

 On Determination of Thresholds in Three-Way Approximation of Many-Valued NM-Logic    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.136-143 

 Approximation of a many-valued logic by a logic with less number of truth values is an important topic. Three-way approximation based on a pair of thresholds is an example considered by Yao. However, the determination of thresholds has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we aim to study this issue in the context of many-valued NM-logic with the standard valuation domain \({\{0,\frac{1}{n-1},\frac{2}{n-1},\cdots,\frac{n-2}{n-1},1\}}\). The main result is that when n is odd, the thresholds for three-way decision is uniquely determined. When n is even, there is actually no three-way decision, but two-way decision.

 Decision-theoretic rough set is a special rough set approach, which includes both misclassification and delayed decision costs. Though the property of monotonicity does not always hold in decision-theoretic rough set, the decision-monotonicity reduct may help us to increase both lower approximation and upper approximation. The experimental results in this paper tell us that by comparing with the original decision system, more cost is required with decision-monotonicity reduct. The implied philosophy is: if you want to get more, you should pay more!   

 An Incremental Clustering Approach Based on Three-Way Decisions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.152-159 

 Most of the clustering algorithms reported assume a data set does not always change. However, it is often observed that the analyzed data set changes over time. To combat changes, we introduce a new incremental soft clustering approach based on three-way decisions theory in this paper. Firstly, an initial clustering algorithm is proposed by using representative points. Secondly, to eliminate the influence of the processing order on final incremental clustering results, the incremental data is pre-clustered the same way. To quickly search similar areas for incremental data, a searching tree based on the representative points is constructed, and the strategies of searching and updating are presented. Finally, the three-way decisions strategy is used for incremental clustering. The results of the example analysis show the approach is effective to incremental clustering.   

 Determining Three-Way Decision Regions with Gini Coefficients    
   
 Conference Paper

  2014 International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.160-171 

 Three-way decision rules can be constructed from rough set regions, i.e., positive, negative and boundary regions. These rough set regions can be viewed as the acceptance, rejection, and non-commitment decision regions in three-way classification. Interpretation and determination of decision regions are one of the key issues of three-way decision and rough set theories. We investigate the relationship between changes in rough set regions and their impacts on the Gini coefficients of decision regions. Effective decision regions can be obtained by satisfying objective functions of Gini coefficients of decision regions. Three different objective functions are discussed in this paper. The example shows that effective decision regions can be obtained by tuning Gini coefficients of decision regions to satisfy a certain objective function. It is suggested that with the new approach more applicable decision regions and decision rules may be obtained.   

 Cost-Sensitive Three-Way Decisions Model Based on CCA    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.172-180 

 The concept of three-way decisions was proposed by Yao and most of three-way decisions models use two thresholds α and β to partition the universe into three parts: the positive region POS(X), the negative region NEG(X) and the boundary region BND(X). But acquirement of a pair of thresholds is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new method to get the thresholds of three-way decisions model. We introduce loss function into three-way decisions model based on constructive covering algorithm (CCA). A loss function is interpreted as the costs of making classification decisions. More specifically, for reducing losses of classification, we change the radius of the cover according to the loss function, then we compute the thresholds based on the modification. This paper propose an effective method to compute thresholds α and β, which is according to cost-sensitive three-way decisions model based on CCA.   

 Feature Selection Based on Confirmation-Theoretic Rough Sets    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  RSCTC 2014 
  pp.181-188 

 As an important part of data preprocessing in machine learning and data mining, feature selection, also known as attribute reduction in rough set theory, is the process of choosing the most informative subset of features. Rough set theory has been used as such a tool with much success. The main objective of this paper is to propose a feature selection procedure based on a special group of probabilistic rough set models, called confirmation-theoretic rough set model(CTRS). Different from the existing attribute reduction methods, the definition of positive features is based on Bayesian confirmation measures. The proposed method is further divided into two categories based on the qualitative and quantitative nature of the underlying rough set models. This study provides new insights into the problem of attribute reduction.   

 Fuzzy-Attributes and a Method to Reduce Concept Lattices

 Reducing the size of the concept lattices is a fundamental problem in formal concept analysis. This paper presents several properties of useful fuzzy-attributes, in the general case of multi-adjoint concept lattices. Moreover, the use of these fuzzy-attributes provides a mechanism to reduce the size of concept lattices considering a subset of the original one and, therefore, without losing and modifying important information.

  pp.201-210 

 Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as inherently relational can be formalized and generalized by using categorical constructions. This provides a categorical view of the relation between “object” and “attributes”, which can be further extended to a more generalized view on relations as morphisms in Kleisli categories of suitable monads. Structure of sets of “objects” and “attributes” can be provided e.g. by term monads over particular signatures, and specific signatures drawn from and developed within social and health care can be used to illuminate the use of the categorical approach.

 There exists a direct relation between fuzzy rough sets and fuzzy preorders. On the other hand, it is well known the existing parallelism between Formal Concept Analysis and Rough Set Theory. In both cases, Galois connections play a central role. In this work, we focus on adjunctions (also named isotone Galois connections) between fuzzy preordered sets; specifically, we study necessary conditions that have to be fulfilled in order such an adjunction to exist.   

 A New Consensus Tool in Digital Libraries    
   
 Conference Paper

  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.222-231 

 Libraries represent a focal point of academic life and as such serve also a societal purpose of bringing together people around common themes. This purpose is nowadays enhanced and facilitated by the so-called digital libraries. For this reason, it is necessary to develop tools for helping users to reach decision with a high level of conensus in these virtual environments. The aim of this contribution is to present a tool for reaching consensus in order to minimize the main problems that these virtual environments presents (difficulty of establishing trust relations, low and intermittent participation rates, and so on) while incorporating the the benefits that they offers (rich and diverse knowledge due to a large number of users, real-time comunication, and so on). To do so, the fuzzy linguistic modelling is used to represent the users’ opinions.

 In tourism there are attempts to standardize the service quality evaluation, such as the SERVQUAL instrument, which is a five-item scale consisting of: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. However, this scale is not commonly used in the most popular tourism websites. In this context, we present an implementation, using IBM SPSS Modeler, of a linguistic multi-criteria decision making model to integrate the hotel guests’ opinions included in the WWW and expressed on other dimensions (or attributes) in order to obtain a SERVQUAL scale evaluation value of service quality. As a particular case study, we show an application example using TripAdvisor website.   

 Integration of Dependent Features on Sensory Evaluation Processes    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.240-249 

 The aim of a sensory evaluation process is to compute the global value of each evaluated product by means of an evaluator set, according to a set of sensory features. Several sensory evaluation models have been proposed which use classical aggregation operators to summary the sensory information, assuming independent sensory features, i.e, there is not interaction among them. However, the sensory information is perceived by the set of human senses and, depending on the evaluated product, its sensory features may be dependent and present interaction among them. In this contribution, we present the integration of dependent sensory features in sensory evaluation processes. To do so, we propose the use of the fuzzy measure in conjunction with the Choquet integral to deal with this dependence, extending a sensory evaluation model proposed in the literature. This sensory evaluation model has the advantage that offers linguistic terms to handle the uncertainty and imprecision involved in evaluation sensory processes. Finally, an illustrative example of a sensory evaluation process with dependent sensory features is shown.

 Low back pain affects a large proportion of the adult population at some point in their lives and has a major economic and social impact. To soften this impact, one possible solution is to make use of recommender systems, which have already been introduced in several health fields. In this paper, we present TPLUFIB-WEB, a novel fuzzy linguistic Web system that uses a recommender system to provide personalized exercises to patients with low back pain problems and to offer recommendations for their prevention. This system may be useful to reduce the economic impact of low back pain, help professionals to assist patients, and inform users on low back pain prevention measures. A strong part of TPLUFIB-WEB is that it satisfies the Web quality standards proposed by the Health On the Net Foundation (HON), Official College of Physicians of Barcelona, and Health Quality Agency of the Andalusian Regional Government, endorsing the health information provided and warranting the trust of users.   

 On Distances for Cooperative Games and Non-additive Measures with Communication Situations

  pp.262-269 

 Non-additive (fuzzy) measures also known as cooperative games or capacities are set functions that can be used to evaluate subsets of a reference set. In order to evaluate their similarities and differences, we can consider distances between pairs of measures. Games have been extended to communication situations in which besides of the game there is a graph that establishes which sets are feasible (which coalitions are possible, which individuals can cooperate). In this paper we consider the problem of defining a distance for pairs of measures when not all sets are feasible.   

 TSK-0 Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems for High-Dimensional Problems Using the Apriori Principle for Rule Generation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.270-279 

 Algorithms which learn Linguistic Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems from data usually start up from the definition of the linguistic variables, generate a set of candidate rules and, afterwards, search a subset of them through a metaheuristic technique. In high-dimensional datasets the number of candidate rules is intractable, and a preselection is a must. This work adapts an existing preselection algorithm for Fuzzy Asociation Rule-Based Classification Systems to deal with TSK-0 LFRBSs. Experimental results show a good behaviour of the adaptation allowing to build precise and simple models for high-dimensional problems.

 Road accident is a disaster that vocalizes a major cause of disability, untimely death and the loss of human lives. Therefore, investigating the condition of road accidents for prediction and prevention purposes on highways is significant. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy granular decision tree to generate the road accident rules applying the discrete and continuous data stored in accident databases. Among all critical factors in the occurrence of traffic accidents, environmental factors and road design (geometry) are considered in this study. This method establishes an optimized fuzzy granular decision tree with the minimum redundancy and road accident severity classification using fuzzy reasoning. California highways were considered as the case study to examine the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is approximately 16% more accurate than the fuzzy ID3 method with less redundancy in constructing the decision tree.   

 Using Imprecise Probabilities to Extract Decision Rules via Decision Trees for Analysis of Traffic Accidents    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.288-298 

 The main aim of this study is focused on the extraction or obtaining of important decision rules (DRs) using decision trees (DTs) from traffic accidents’ data. These decision rules identify patterns related with the severity of the accident. In this work, we have incorporated a new split criterion to built decision trees in a method named Information Root Node Variation (IRNV) used for extracting these DRs. It will be shown that, with the adding of this criterion, the information obtained from the method is improved trough new and different decision rules, some of them use different variables than the ones obtained with the original method.

 Sorting a set of inputs for relevance in modeling problems may be ambiguous if the data is vague. A general extension procedure is proposed in this paper that allows applying different deterministic or random feature selection algorithms to fuzzy data. This extension is based on a model of the relevance of a feature as a possibility distribution. The possibilistic relevances are ordered with the help of a fuzzy ranking. A practical problem where the most informative software metrics are searched for in an automatic grading problem is solved with this technique.   

 Classification of a Sequence of Objects with the Fuzzy Decoding Method    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.309-318 

 The problem of recognition of a sequence of objects (e.g., video-based image recognition, phoneme recognition) is explored. The generalization of the fuzzy phonetic decoding method is proposed by assuming the distribution of the classified object to be of exponential type. Its preliminary phase includes association of each model object with the fuzzy set of model classes with grades of membership defined as the confusion probabilities estimated with the Kullback-Leibler divergence between model distributions. At first, each object (e.g., frame) in a classified sequence is put in correspondence with the fuzzy set which grades are defined as the posterior probabilities. Next, this fuzzy set is intersected with the fuzzy set corresponding to the nearest neighbor. Finally, the arithmetic mean of these fuzzy intersections is assigned to the decision for the whole sequence. In this paper we propose not to limit the method’s usage with the Kullback-Leibler discrimination and to estimate the grades of membership of models and query objects based on an arbitrary distance with appropriate scale factor. The experimental results in the problem of isolated Russian vowel phonemes and words recognition for state-of-the-art measures of similarity are presented. It is shown that the correct choice of the scale parameter can significantly increase the recognition accuracy.   

 Dynamic Filtering of Ranked Answers When Evaluating Fuzzy XPath Queries    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.319-330 

 We have recently designed an extension of the XPath language which provides ranked answers to flexible queries taking profit of fuzzy variants of and, or and avg operators for XPath conditions, as well as two structural constraints, called down and deep, for which a certain degree of relevance is associated. In practice, this degree is very low for some answers weakly accomplishing with the original query, and hence, they should not be computed in order to alleviate the computational complexity of the information retrieval process. In this work we focus on the scalability of our interpreter for dealing with massive XML files by making use of its ability for prematurely disregarding those computations leading to non significant solutions (i.e., with a poor degree of relevance according the preferences expressed by users when using the new command FILTER). Since our proposal has been implemented with a fuzzy logic language, here we exploit the high expressive resources of this declarative paradigm for performing “dynamic thresholding” in a very natural and efficient way, thus connecting with the so-called top-k answering problem, which is very well-known in the fuzzy logic and soft computing arena.   

 Individual Decisions under Group Consensus

  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.331-338 

 In the group decision of this paper, it is assumed that the practice is entrusted to each decision maker. In such a decision problem, it is not necessary for a decision maker to obey the group decision completely, but necessary to consider it into his/her final decision. In this paper, when a group of decision makers give the comparisons of alternatives, their individual decisions are obtained as the interval weights of alternatives so as to have a common weight. The problem is formulated based on Interval AHP. By relaxing two conditions of the individual decisions for a consensus, a decision maker has to admit the modification of his/her initial judgments and/or the enlargement of his/her individual decision.   

 Fuzzy Ontology-Based Approach for Automatic Construction of User Profiles    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing - 9th International Conference, RSCTC 2014 

 This paper shows a fuzzy ontology based approach to automatically build user profiles from a collection of user interest documents. The ontological representation of the user profile enhances the performance in tasks such as filtering, categorization and information retrieval. The proposed technique takes advantage of relevance measures to generate semantic representations of user context. The proposed work also presents a strategy for automatic generation of fuzzy ontologies to support user profile modeling. The experiments performed confirm that the automatically obtained fuzzy ontologies are good representation of the user’s preferences. In order to test the applicability of the obtained ontologies, a text categorization experiment has been proposed and the obtained results indicate that the approach can be applied with satisfactory results and warrants further research.   

 Hierarchically Structured Recommender System for Improving NPS of a Company

  pp.347-357 

 The paper presents a description of a hierarchically structured recommender system for improving the efficiency of a company’s growth engine. Our dataset (NPS dataset) contains answers to a set of queries (called questionnaire) sent to a randomly chosen groups of customers. It covers 34 companies called clients. The purpose of the questionnaire is to check customer satisfaction in using services of these companies which have repair shops all involved in a similar type of business (fixing heavy equipment). These shops are located in 29 states in the US and Canada. Some of the companies have their shops located in more than one state. They can compete with each other only if they target the same group of customers. The performance of a company is evaluated using the Net Promoter System (NPS). For that purpose, the data from the completed questionnaires are stored in NPS datasets. We have 34 such datasets, one for each company. Knowledge extracted from them, especially action rules and their triggers, can be used to build recommender systems giving hints to companies how to improve their NPS ratings. Larger the datasets, our believe in the knowledge extracted from them is higher. We introduce the concept of semantic similarity between companies. More semantically similar the companies are, the knowledge extracted from their joined NPS datasets has higher accuracy and coverage. Our hierarchically structured recommender system is a collection of recommender systems organized as a tree. Lower the nodes in the tree, more specialized the recommender systems are and the same the classifiers and action rules used to build their recommendation engines have higher precision and accuracy.

 Groups of learners of similar features are often created in order to diversify the environment accordingly. However student preferences may differ depending on the context of the system usage. Each new student, who intends to join the community, should obtain context-aware recommendation of the group of colleagues matching his needs. In the paper, using fuzzy logic for modeling student groups is considered. We propose to build the possibility-based representation of each group. We assume that context can be modeled by a vector of weights. Then recommendations for new students are determined taking into account a degree of possibility of matching together with the respective context parameters. We examine the presented approach by taking into account learning style dimensions as attributes which characterize student preferences. The method is evaluated on the basis of experimental results obtained for data of different groups of real students.

  pp.366-373 

 Nowadays, surveillance systems are less dependent of humans’ interactions, mostly in event’s detection. However, there still are tasks to be performed by humans that could be delegated to autonomous robots. The integration of an autonomous service robot, as an agent, in a multi-agent surveillance system can reduce even more humans’ dependency. This paper proposes a new architecture and a communication protocol that integrates ServRobot’s autonomous robot into DVA’s surveillance system. This integration allows the DVA’s system to use the robot as a mobile unit for validation of triggered events, to perform surveillance missions and to gather sensors information.   

 Image Coverage Segmentation Based on Soft Boundaries    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2014 
  International Conference on Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 
  pp.374-381 

 This paper studies image object coverage segmentation by introducing soft boundaries. By using soft boundaries, fuzzy image can be segmented into several classes with a sharing boundary which is called a soft boundary. In this paper, several concepts of boundaries are defined, namely, hard boundary, inner boundary and outer boundary. Soft boundary is defined by the subtraction between inner boundary and outer boundary of a set. Coverage segmentation algorithm and optimization method are proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, neighbor decision rules are used in classification of pixels to filter noise or outliers. Experiments and comparison with classical coverage segmentation methods are presented, including noise test on the proposed method with four kinds of boundaries and neighbor decision rules.

  pp.382-389 

 Conventional color histogram is sensitive to noisy interference such as illumination and quantization errors. Furthermore, small changes in the conventional color histogram might result great changes due to large dimension or histogram bins. This paper presents a modified fuzzy color histogram. Firstly, it considers each pixel’s color associated to all the histogram bins according to fuzzy logic and provides a histogram with single-dimension based on the CIELAB color space. Thus, it has the capacity to tolerate noisy interference and reduce computational complexity. Then, it combines the information about the location of pixels in an image to record the human vision perception variation in different spatial positions within an image. The proposed histogram is further exploit in the application of image indexing and retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed histogram is more accurate and efficient in retrieving the user-interested images.

 We present a segmentation method that estimates the relative coverage of each pixel in a sensed image by each image component. The proposed super-resolution blur-aware model (utilizes a priori knowledge of the image blur) for linear unmixing of image intensities relies on a sparsity promoting approach expressed by two main requirements: (i) minimization of Huberized total variation, providing smooth object boundaries and noise removal, and (ii) minimization of nonedge image fuzziness, responding to an assumption that imaged objects are crisp and that fuzziness is mainly due to the imaging and digitization process. Edge fuzziness due to partial coverage is allowed, enabling subpixel precise feature estimates. The segmentation is formulated as an energy minimization problem and solved by the spectral projected gradient method, utilizing a graduated nonconvexity scheme. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on synthetic and real multichannel images confirms good performance, particularly relevant when subpixel precision in segmentation and subsequent analysis is a requirement.

A few years later, (in 1980) at the International Symposium on Multiple-valued Logic, in Evanston, Illinois, I met Prof. Enric Trillas, and that was the beginning of a deep, long lasting and “most dangerous” friendship: I started to be systematically exposed to the world of fuzzy, in a series of fuzzy related Seminars and Summer Schools organized by Prof. Trillas at different places in Spain, to which I was always invited. In one of the early Seminars he gave me as a present his recently published book on Fuzzy Sets [15]. I had no longer an excuse and I started to learn fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. When in 1986 I became a Professor at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Dortmund, Germany, I introduced for the first time at the Department, seminars on fuzzy systems, which paved the way for my later Courses on “Intelligent Systems”, (there is no accepted German equivalent for “Soft Computing”), as well as for several Master and Ph.D. Theses in the area.

  Item recommendation depends on metadata describing items as well as users through their profiles. Most currently used technologies use precise metadata because of the efficiency of the recommendation process. Nonetheless fuzzy metadata can be useful because of their ability to deal with imprecision and gradedness, two features pervading real-world applications. Fuzzy metadata can have both ... [Show full abstract]  possibilistic and veristic interpretations, which are complementary and can simultaneously occur in a recommendation context. In this paper we describe a preliminary approach to deal with this double interpretation proposing an extension of the theory of veristic variables, that is specifically suited for item recommendation. Fuzzy metadata are used to calculate the interestingness of an item for a user computing possibility and necessity measures, which enable the ranking of items. As described in the illustrative examples, this approach effectively provides for semantically significant results that are useful for item recommendation with fuzzy metadata.

  In this paper we discuss possible future directions of research for soft computing in the context of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering. Fundamental issues are presented with basic ideas emphasised rather than detailed accounts of algorithms and procedures. The use of fuzzy sets to machine learning, computer intelligence and creativity are discussed in relation to the central ... [Show full abstract]  problems of creating knowledge from data, pattern recognition, making summaries, user modelling for computer/human interfaces, co-operative learning, fuzzy inheritance for associative reasoning. A voting model semantics for fuzzy sets is used to develop ideas for a mass assignment theory which provides the means of moving from the case of crisp sets to that of fuzzy sets. The use of fuzzy sets in this way will provide better interpolation, greater knowledge compression, and less dependence on the effects of noisy data than if only crisp sets were used. We will see how easy and useful it is to use successful inference methods such as decision trees, probabilistic fuzzy logic type rules, Bayesian nets with attributes taking fuzzy values rather than crisp values. The mass assignment theory provides a unified approach to handling both probabilistic uncertainty and fuzzy vagueness.

In order to store the information, a memory unit is introduced between the fuzzy inference layer and the fuzzification layer. This recurrent structure enhances the prediction capability; hence, this RNFN model can be used to develop the multistep ahead predictive controller. The objective function of model based controller (MPC) minimizes the future control moves. The gradient descent (GD) algorithm is used to the optimize control moves. The proposed RNFN model is used to develop a model predictive controller. The performance of the RNFN-MPC is compared with that of a neuro fuzzy network (NFN)–based MPC for a laboratory scale quadruple tank process.

Each concept in PFCM is extended to a fuzzy event that models not only the fuzzy degree but also the fuzzy probability of both the cause and the effect concepts. PFCM enhances the capability of conventional FCMs to handle both randomness and fuzziness which are necessary to model the ... [Show full abstract]  uncertainty involved in inference process of complex causal system. A formalized inference process of PFCMs is presented for adjustments on probability of fuzzy events and for dynamic update of causal weights. This enables PFCM to synthetically analyze the impacts of randomness and fuzziness on causal inference process. The simulation result shows a good match to the above features of PFCM. PFCM, as an initial attempt, provides a heuristic approach to model the uncertainty of complex causal systems and opens a collection of interesting research issues for further research.

 Abstract  
   
 The paper presents a description of a hierarchically structured recommender system for improving the efficiency of a company’s growth engine. Our dataset (NPS dataset) contains answers to a set of queries (called questionnaire) sent to a randomly chosen groups of customers. It covers 34 companies called clients. The purpose of the questionnaire is to check customer satisfaction in using services of these companies which have repair shops all involved in a similar type of business (fixing heavy equipment). These shops are located in 29 states in the US and Canada. Some of the companies have their shops located in more than one state. They can compete with each other only if they target the same group of customers. The performance of a company is evaluated using the Net Promoter System (NPS). For that purpose, the data from the completed questionnaires are stored in NPS datasets. We have 34 such datasets, one for each company. Knowledge extracted from them, especially action rules and their triggers, can be used to build recommender systems giving hints to companies how to improve their NPS ratings. Larger the datasets, our believe in the knowledge extracted from them is higher. We introduce the concept of semantic similarity between companies. More semantically similar the companies are, the knowledge extracted from their joined NPS datasets has higher accuracy and coverage. Our hierarchically structured recommender system is a collection of recommender systems organized as a tree. Lower the nodes in the tree, more specialized the recommender systems are and the same the classifiers and action rules used to build their recommendation engines have higher precision and accuracy.

 Action Rules are rule based systems that extract actionable patterns which are hidden in big volumes of data. Users need recommendations on actions they can undertake to increase their profit or accomplish their goals, this recommendations are provided by Actionable patterns. In the technological world of big data, massive amounts of data are collected by organizations, including in major domains like financial, medical, social media and Internet of Things(IoT). To analyze and store such a massive amount of data, distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark are introduced to store the big data in a distributed fashion which manage and analyze them in parallel. The traditional Action Rules extraction models, which analyze the data in a nondistributed fashion, do not perform well when dealing larger datasets. Serious complications of discovering Action Rules with such distributed environments are - data distribution among computing nodes and calculation of major parameters including : support, confidence, utility, and coverage, that represent the whole data. Information granules form basic entities in the world of Granular Computing(GrC), which represents meaningful smaller units derived from a larger complex information system. In this research, we focus on the data distribution phase of the distributed Actionable Pattern Mining problem. To handle the data distribution task by splitting the big data in both horizontal and vertical fashions - we propose partition threshold rho. In this work, we concentrate on using information granules to implement a vertical data splitting strategy with Meta Actions. Hence our results discover valuable Actionable Knowledge with application in Business and Education domains.

For example, recommending the business to improve customer satisfaction [5]  and sentiment analysis on Twitter [6]. Action rules follow the representation, similar to Equation 1, as given in Equation 2, where Ψ represents a conjunction of stable features, (α → β) represents a conjunction of changes in values of flexible features and (θ → φ) represents desired decision action. ...

 Action Rules are rule based systems for discovering actionable patterns hidden in a large dataset. Action Rules recommend actions that a user or a system can undertake to their advantage, or to accomplish their goal. Current Action Rules extraction methods are unable to process huge volumes of data in a reasonable time and it requires a distributed and parallel extraction methods. Limited research has been done on extracting Action Rules using a distributed scenario. Major complications of discovering Action Rules with such distributed systems are data distribution among computing nodes and calculation of major parameters of action rules. In this work, we propose few methods to handle the big data distribution among computation nodes using the Spark framework. With enhanced experiments made on datasets in transportation, medical, and business domains, we show our methods achieve almost equal valid results compared to results from classical non-distributed Action Rule discovery methods with improved run time.

 The paper proposes a new strategy called HAMIS to improve NPS (Net Promoter Score) of certain companies involved in heavy equipment repair in the US and Canada - we call them clients. HAMIS is based on the semantic dendrogram built by using agglomerative clustering strategy and semantic distance between clients. More similar is the knowledge extracted from two clients, more close these clients semantically are to each other. Each company is represented by a dataset which is built from answers to the questionnaire sent to a number of randomly chosen customers using services offered by this company. Before knowledge is extracted from these datasets, each one is extended by merging it with datasets which are close to it in the semantic dendrogram, have higher NPS, and if classifiers extracted from them have higher FS-score. Action rules are extracted from these extended datasets and used for providing recommendations to clients of how to improve their businesses.

 The paper presents one of the main modules of HAMIS recommender system built for 34 business companies (clients) involved in heavy equipment repair in the US and Canada. This module is responsible for meta-actions discovery from a large collection of comments, written as text, collected from customers about their satisfaction with services provided by each client. Meta-actions, when executed, trigger action rules discovered from customers data which are in a table format. We specifically focus on the process of mining meta-actions, which consists of four representative and characteristic steps involving sentiment analysis and text summarization. Arranging these four steps in proposed order distinguishes our work from others and better serves our purpose. Compared to procedures presented in other works, each step in our procedure is adapted accordingly with respect to our own observations and knowledge of the domain. Results obtained from the experiments prove the high effectiveness of the proposed approach for mining meta-actions.

 The paper concerns the problem of action-rule extraction when datasets are large. Such rules can be used to construct a knowledge base in a recommendation system. One of the popular approaches to construct action rules in such cases is to partition the dataset horizontally (personalization) and vertically. Different clustering strategies can be used for this purpose. Action rules extracted from vertical clusters can be combined and used as knowledge discovered from the horizontal clusters of the initial dataset. The number of extracted rules strongly depends on the methods used to complete that task. In this study, we chose a software package called SCARI recently developed by Sikora and his colleagues. It follows a rule-based strategy for action-rule extraction that requires prior extraction of classification rules and generates a relatively small number of rules in comparison to object-based strategies, which discover action rules directly from datasets. Correlation between attributes was used to cluster them. We used an agglomerative strategy to cluster attributes of a dataset and present the results by using a dendrogram. Each level of the dendrogram shows a vertical partition schema for the initial dataset. From all partitions, for each level, action rules are extracted and then concatenated. Their precision, the lightness, and the number of rules are presented and compared. Lightness shows how many action rules can be applied on average for each tuple in a dataset.

 Customer Churn Reduction Based on Action Rules and Collaboration

 Action rule mining is an important technology that can be applied to build recommender systems for reducing customer churn. Confidence, support, and coverage are used to measure the quality of action rules. In practice, action rules with higher confidence and support are more useful to users. However, there is little research work focused on improving the quality of the discovered action rules. To improve the quality of action rules extracted from a given client, this article proposes a guided (by threshold) agglomerative clustering algorithm by utilizing the knowledge extracted from semantically similar clients. The idea is to pick up only such clients that are doing better in business than the given client and are semantically similar with the given client. By doing that, the given client can follow business recommendations from the better-performing clients. The algorithm is guided by the threshold value checking how large the improvement of action rules discovered so far in their confidence is. If the improvement is lower than this threshold, the algorithm stops.

 This study was conducted to determine the dietary phenylalanine for fingerling Oreochromis niloticus by conducting an 8 weeks experiment in a flow-through system (1-1.5L/min) at 28°C water temperature. Phenylalanine requirement was determined by feeding six casein-gelatin based amino acid test diets (350 g kg– 1 CP; 16.72 kJ g–1 GE) with graded levels of phenylalanine (4, 6.5 9, 11.5, 14 and 16.5 g kg–1 dry diet) at a constant level (10 g kg–1) of dietary tyrosine to triplicate groups of fish (1.65±0.09 g) near to satiation. Absolute weight gain (AWG g fish-1), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein deposition (PD%), phenylalanine retention efficiency (PRE%) and RNA/DNA ratio was found to improve with the increasing concentrations of phenylalanine and peaked at 11.5 g kg–1 of dry diet. Quadratic regression analysis of AWG, PD and PRE against varying levels of dietary phenylalanine indicated the requirement at 12.1, 11.6, and 12.7 g kg–1 dry diet, respectively and the inclusion of phenylalanine at 12.1 g kg–1 of dry diet corresponding to 34.6 g kg–1 dietary protein is optimum for this fish. Based on above data, total aromatic amino acid requirement of fingerling O. niloticus was found to be 20.6 g kg–1 (12.1 g kg–1 phenylalanine+8.5 g kg–1 tyrosine) of dry diet, corresponding to 58.8 g kg–1 of dietary protein.

 Customer attrition is an important problem in many industries: banking, mobile service providers, insurance companies, financial service companies etc. One company from the heavy equipment repair industry within this research project expressed interest in the insight of the problem, already having their own active CRM program implemented. The goal and motivation within this topic is to determine whether there are markers in the sales trends that might suggest a customer is getting ready to defect. Observing the behavior of customers who left a company, one might be able to identify customers who might leave as well.

The idea is to limit the number of score benchmark questions, and let customers express their opinions in a free format. As a result the collected data will mainly contain open-ended text comments. This chapter presents a strategy to modify the existing recommender system built based on both numerical (structured) and text data (unstructured) to work on unstructured data only to make it work with the new survey format.

 Visual techniques were used to support complex customer data analytics and illustrate concepts and data mining algorithms behind the built Recommender System. The implemented web-based visual system supports a feature analysis of 38 client companies for each year between 2011–2016 in the area of customer service (divided into shop service/field service) and parts. It serves as a visualization for the feature selection method showing the relative importance of each feature in terms of its relevance to the decision attribute—Promoter Status, and is based on an algorithm that finds minimal decision reducts. It allows the user to interactively assess the changes and implications onto predictive characteristics of the knowledge-based model. It is supported by visual additions in form of charts showing accuracy, coverage and confusion matrix of the model built on the corresponding, user-chosen dataset.

 In Search for Best Meta-Actions to Boost Businesses Revenue    
   
 Chapter    
 Jan 2016

 The ultimate goal of our research is to build recommender system driven by action rules and meta-actions for providing proper suggestions to improve revenue of a group of clients (companies) involved with similar businesses. Collected data present answers from 25,000 customers concerning their personal information, general information about the service and customers’ feedback to the service. This paper proposes a strategy to classify and organize meta-actions in such a way that they can be applied most efficiently to achieve desired goal. Meta-actions are the triggers that need to be executed for activating action rules. In previous work, the method of mining meta-actions from customers’ reviews in text format has been proposed and implemented. Performed experiments have proven its high effectiveness. However, it turns out that the discovered action rules need more than one meta-action to be triggered. The way and the order of executing triggers causes new problems due to the commonness, differential benefit and applicability among sets of meta-actions. Since the applicability of meta-actions should be judged by professionals in the field, our concentration is put on designing a strategy to hierarchically sort and arrange so called meta-nodes (used to represent action rules and their triggers in a tree structure) as well as to compute the effect of each meta-node. Furthermore, users will have more concrete options to consider by following the path in trees built from these meta-nodes.

 Association Action Rules and Action Paths Triggered by Meta-actions

 Action rules are built from atomic expressions called atomic action terms and they describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another. They involve changes of values within one decision attribute. Association action rule is similar to an action rule but it may refer to changes of values involving several attributes listed in its decision part. Action paths are defined as sequences of association action rules with the assumption that the last rule in a sequence is as action rule. Early research on action rule discovery usually required the extraction of classification rules before constructing any action rule. Newest algorithms discover action rules and association action rules directly from an information system. This paper presents a strategy for generating association action rules and action paths by incorporating the use of meta-actions and influence matrices. Action paths show the cascading effect of meta-actions leading to a desired goal.

 Action rules can be seen as logical terms describing knowledge about possible actions associated with objects which is hidden in a decision system. Classical strategy for discovering them from a database requires prior extraction of classification rules which next are evaluated pair by pair with a goal to build a strategy of action based on condition features in order to get a desired effect on a decision feature. An actionable strategy is represented as a term r = [(w) Ù(a® b)] Þ [f® y]r = [(\omega) \wedge (\alpha \rightarrow \beta)] \Rightarrow [\phi \rightarrow \psi] , where ω, α, β, φ, and ψ are descriptions of objects or events. The term r states that when the fixed condition ω is satisfied and the changeable behavior (α→β) occurs in objects represented as tuples from a database so does the expectation (φ→ψ). This paper proposes a new strategy, called ARAS, for constructing action rules with the main module resembling LERS [6]. ARAS system is more simple than DEAR and its time complexity is also lower.

 An action is defined as controlling or changing some of attribute values in an information system to achieve desired result. An action reduct is a minimal set of attribute values distinguishing a favorable object from other objects. We use action reducts to formulate necessary actions. The action suggested by an action reduct induces changes of decision attribute values by changing the condition attribute values to the distinct patterns in action reducts.

 Action rules describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute. Early research on action rule discovery usually required the extraction of classification rules before constructing any action rule. Newest algorithms discover action rules directly from a decision system. To our knowledge, all these algorithms assume that all attributes are symbolic or require prior discretization of all numerical attributes. This paper presents a new approach for generating action rules from datasets with numerical attributes by incorporating a tree classifier and a pruning step based on meta-actions. Meta-actions are seen as a higher-level knowledge (provided by experts) about correlations between different attributes.

 Decision tables classifying customers into groups of different profitability are used for mining rules classifying customers. Attributes are divided into two groups: stable and flexible. By stable attributes we mean attributes which values can not be changed by a bank (age, marital status, number of children are the examples). On the other hand attributes (like percentage rate or loan approval to buy a house in certain area) which values can be changed or influenced by a bank are called flexible. Rules are extracted from a decision table given preference to flexible attributes. This new class of rules forms a special repository of rules from which new rules called actionrules are constructed. They show what actions should be taken to improve the profitability of customers.

 Action rules provide hints to a business user what actions (i.e. changes within some values of flexible attributes) should be taken to improve the profitability of customers. That is, taking some actions to re-classify some customers from less desired decision class to the more desired one. However, in previous work, each action rule was constructed from two rules, extracted earlier, defining different profitability classes. In this paper, we make a first step towards formally introducing the problem of mining action rules from scratch and present formal definitions. In contrast to previous work, our formulation provides guarantee on verifying completeness and correctness of discovered action rules. In addition to formulating the problem from an inductive learning viewpoint, we provide theoretical analysis on the complexities of the problem and its variations. Furthermore, we present efficient algorithms for mining action rules from scratch. In an experimental study we demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques.

 Mining irregular association rules based on action & non-action type data    
   
 Conference Paper    
 Jul 2010

 Conventional positive association rules are the patterns that occur frequently together. These patterns represent what decisions are routinely made based on a set of facts. Irregular association rules are the patterns that represent what decisions are rarely made based on the same set of facts. Many domains like Healthcare, Banking etc need the irregular rule to improve their system. In this paper, we propose a level wise search algorithm that works based on action and non-action type data to find irregular association rules. We have observed that irregular association rules can be discovered efficiently based on action type and non-action type data from large database. To the best of our knowledge, there is no algorithm that can determine such type of associations. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated by testing it for a real world patient data set.

 Traditional event-condition-action (ECA) rules in real-time active database (RTADB) lack the capabilities to express complicated quantitative temporal information in the system. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present graphical ECA rules with a set of novel temporal events to specify real-time constraints. Smart home applications are used to validate the proposed rules.

 Action rules (or actionable patterns) describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute. Strategies for discovering them can be divided into two types: rule based and object based. Rule-based actionable patterns are built on the foundations of preexisting rules. This approach consists of two main steps: (1) a standard learning method is used to detect interesting patterns in the form of classification rules, association rules, or clusters; (2) the second step is to use an automatic or semiautomatic strategy to inspect such results and derive possible action strategies. These strategies provide an insight of how values of some attributes need to be changed so the desirable objects can be shifted to a desirable group. Object-based approach assumes that actionable patterns are extracted directly from a database. System DEAR, presented in this paper, is an example of a rule-based approach. System ARD and system for association rules mining are examples of an object-based approach. Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is taken as an application domain. We show how to manipulate the music score using action rules. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 The One Number you Need to Grow    
   
 Article

  HARVARD BUS REV 

 Frederick F Reichheld 
    
 Companies spend lots of time and money on complex tools to assess customer satisfaction. But they're measuring the wrong thing. The best predictor of top-line growth can usually be captured in a single survey question: Would you recommend this company to a friend? This finding is based on two years of research in which a variety of survey questions were tested by linking the responses with actual customer behavior--purchasing patterns and referrals--and ultimately with company growth. Surprisingly, the most effective question wasn't about customer satisfaction or even loyalty per se. In most of the industries studied, the percentage of customers enthusiastic enough about a company to refer it to a friend or colleague directly correlated with growth rates among competitors. Willingness to talk up a company or product to friends, family, and colleagues is one of the best indicators of loyalty because of the customer's sacrifice in making the recommendation. When customers act as references, they do more than indicate they've received good economic value from a company; they put their own reputations on the line. And they will risk their reputations only if they feel intense loyalty. The findings point to a new, simpler approach to customer research, one directly linked to a company's results. By substituting a single question--blunt tool though it may appear to be--for the complex black box of the customer satisfaction survey, companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth.

  La reconnaissance des expériences et des compétences dans le domaine de la formation est devenue un droit individuel et un facteur de régulation socioéconomique dans plusieurs pays comme la France, le Canada, la Belgique, etc. Dans cette optique, tous les individus, quelle que soit leur origine sociale, ont l’opportunité de faire valoriser leurs savoirs et connaissances afin d’obtenir soit un ... [Show full abstract]  diplôme soit des acquis crédités, par voie de reconnaissance des acquis et des compétences, à la suite des preuves justificatives de leurs expériences. C’est en ce sens que le gouvernement du Québec s’attèle à donner à chaque individu la chance de se faire connaitre, de faire valoir leurs compétences sans tenir compte de leurs caractéristiques ascriptives et adopter des dispositions légales pour faciliter des pratiques institutionnelles de reconnaissance juste et équitable. Se faire valoriser réclame la motivation et la détermination de l’individu dans la poursuite des démarches de reconnaissance : demande de justification, écriture de documents, prestation orale ; pour construire des connaissances, pour démontrer les compétences, pour obtenir des crédits, communiquer une image de soi et légitimer les expériences. Cette recherche documentaire porte sur les pratiques de reconnaissance des acquis extrascolaires des étudiants en enseignement supérieur au Québec et se déroule sur une période datant de 1986 à 2016. Elle cherche à comprendre et analyser les pratiques de reconnaissance mises en œuvre par les universités québécoises dans une perspective de justice sociale. Aussi, l’analyse englobe les politiques institutionnelles et gouvernementales, les méthodes d’évaluation ainsi que les enjeux socioculturels et sociopolitiques. Comprendre les grands enjeux sociaux de l’implantation de la reconnaissance des acquis nous semble impératif dans un contexte de mondialisation et de marchandisation de la formation. Il semble important de nous interroger sur les pratiques des établissements d’enseignement supérieur ayant pour responsabilité de former des individus pour pérenniser la société, de promouvoir la culture, encourager la tolérance et le respect d’autrui dans cette complexité sociale. Il faut se demander si les pratiques institutionnelles en matière de reconnaissance des acquis sont justes, accessibles et équitables. La mise en place de la politique de reconnaissance dans les établissements d’enseignement supérieur ne cache-t-elle pas implicitement des inégalités et de l’injustice ? La manière dont les établissements d’enseignement supérieur traitent les demandes de reconnaissance n’abrite-t-elle pas des écueils explicites ou implicites renforçant les difficultés de la plupart des étudiants ?

 Preface   
 This  v  olume  contains  the  pap  ers  selected  for  presentation  at  the  Third  Interna-   
 tional  Conference  on  Rough  Sets  and  Curren  t  T  rends  in  Computing  (RSCTC   
 2002)  held at  P  enn State  Great  V  alley  , Malv  ern, P  ennsylv  ania, U.S.A.,  14–16   
 Octob  er  2002.  Rough  set  theory  and  its  applications  constitute  a  branc  h  of   
 soft  computing  that  has  exhibited  a  signiﬁcan  t  growth  rate  during  recent  y  ears.   
 RSCTC  2002  pro  vided  a  forum  for  exchanging  ideas  among  man  y  researchers   
 in  the  rough  set  comm  unity  and  in  v  arious  areas  of  soft  computing  and  served   
 as  a  stimulus  for  mutual  understanding  and  co  op  eration.  In  recent  years,  there   
 ha  v  e  b  een  a  num  b  er  of  adv  ances  in  rough  set  theory  and  applications.  Hence,  w  e   
 ha  v  e  witnessed  a  growing  n  umber  of  international  w  orkshops  on  rough  sets  and   
 their  applications.  In  addition,  it  should  b  e  observed  that  one  of  the  beauties   
 of  rough  sets  and  the  rough  set  philosoph  y  is  that  it  tends  to  complement  and   
 reinforce  researc  h  in  many  traditional  research  areas  and  applications.  This  is   
 the  main  reason  that  man  y  in  ternational  conferences  are  no  w  including  rough   
 sets  into  the  list  of  topics.   
 It  is  our  great  pleasure  to  dedicate  this  v  olume  to  Professor  Zdzisla  w  Pa-   
 wlak,  who  created  rough  set  theory  ov  er  tw  ent  y  years  ago.  The  growth  of  rough   
 set  theory  and  applications  o  wes  a  great  deal  to  Professor  P  awlak’s  vibrant   
 en  th  usiasm  and  wit  as  well  as  his  great  generosity  to  wards  others,  esp  ecially    
 in  encouraging  and  advising  b  eginners  in  rough  sets.  The  depth,  breadth,  and   
 ric  hness  of  curren  t  rough  set  researc  h  are  directly  traceable  to  Professor  Pa  wlak’s   
 in  v  entiv  eness  and  the  richness  of  his  man  y  insigh  ts  and  ideas  concerning  data   
 mining,  machine  learning,  logic,  and  mathematics.  The  computational  features   
 of  rough  sets  are  also  giving  rise  to  new  forms  of  neuro  computing  based  on  rough   
 sets  and  to  a  family  kno  wn  as  rough  processors  for  digital  computers.  W  e  w  ould   
 also  like  to  congratulate  Professor  Pa  wlak,  who  received  an  honorary  do  ctorate   
 (Do  ctor  Honoris  Causa)  from  Pozna´  n  Polytec  hnic  Universit  y  ,  Pozna´  n,  Poland   
 on  10  April  2002.   
 W  e  wish  to  express  our  gratitude  to  Professors  Zdzisla  w  P  awlak  and  Lotﬁ  A.   
 Zadeh,  who  accepted  our  invitation  to  serv  e  as  honorary  chairs  and  to  presen  t   
 k  eynote  pap  ers  for  this  conference.  W  e  also  wish  to  thank  Professors  J.  Komoro-

 The main purpose of this comprehensive study is to explore the major trends and challenges in machine learning and knowledge extraction. As innovation marches forward at a warp speed, machine learning, and knowledge extraction have emerged as indispensable areas that form the foundation for countless applications across numerous fields. Like many other groundbreaking innovations in today's age, the concept of machine learning was once a figment of our imaginations, confined solely to the realm of science fiction. However, its impact on real-world industries knows no boundaries, and recent advancements have opened a world where tasks are undertaken with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy, reshaping multiple sectors [1]. Machine learning, when combined with data science techniques, has evolved into an indispensable tool that optimizes our daily routines. When adequately trained, these models display phenomenal capabilities frequently surpassing human capabilities in various aspects. In the healthcare industry, for instance, machine learning algorithms can scrutinize medical images including X-rays and MRI scans with unmatched precision thereby assisting doctors in identifying diseases like cancer at an earlier stage making them more treatable[2]. In finance too these algorithms excel at spotting fraudulent transactions instantly ensuring both consumers and businesses stay protected from financial loss[2]. Such instances underline the transformative potential that lies within machine learning technology. This study will dive into the most recent milestones in machine learning algorithms, frameworks, and methodologies. Accentuating their pragmatic value and potential social influence, we look closely at the amalgamation of profound training methods such as reinforcement learning, and transfer learning techniques, systematically evaluating their role in enhancing effectiveness and boosting efficiency in machine learning systems. In addition to that, this comprehensive exploration pinpoints rising trends within the knowledge extraction arena [3]. These include natural language processing techniques along with computer vision-based ones and graph-oriented approaches. We deeply analyze how these developments are fueling new avenues of innovation within realms such as information retrieval or sentiment analysis recommendation systems among others.

 The constructive covering algorithm (CCA) has unique advantages and functions in dealing with multiple-classification problems. To better address the defects and deficiencies of the existing multi-class decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRSs) model, this paper introduces the CCA into DTRSs and constructs a multi-class DTRSs model based on the CCA. First, through the process of machine learning, this method achieves automatic multi-class clustering and effectively addresses the shortcomings of DTRSs in solving multi-class problems, namely, the large amount of computation and the impact of subjective evaluation factors on the inference of threshold values and decision rules as a result of excessive parameters. Second, by optimizing the covering centre and selecting the covering radius, the proposed method improves the efficiency of machine learning. Third, by setting up a distance parameter between covering classes, the method effectively addresses decision redundancy and conflicts when a DTRSs model is used to solve multi-class problems. Then, by organically integrating the cost sensitivity, inter-class distance parameter and class quality function and systematically re-classifying the objects in the boundary domain, it effectively solves the problem of an excessively large boundary domain. Finally, we summarize the decision-making algorithm of the multi-class DTRSs model based on the CCA and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method through experiments.

 This article describes an action rule induction Algorithm based on a sequential covering. Two variants of the Algorithm are presented. The Algorithm allows the action rule induction from a source and a target decision class point of view. The application of rule quality measures enables the induction of action rules that meet various quality criteria. The article also presents a method for recommendation induction. A recommendation indicates the actions required to move an example representing a given source class to the appropriate target class. The recommendation method is based on a set of induced action rules. The experimental part of the article presents the results of the Algorithm operation on sixteen data sets. As a result of the conducted research, the Ac-Rules package was made available.

 The Rough set theory is a very successful tool to deal with vague, inconsistent, imprecise and uncertain knowledge. In recent years, rough set theory and its applications have drawn many researchers' interest progressively in one of its hot issues, viz. the field of artificial intelligence. An intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set, which is a generalization of fuzzy set, has more practical and flexible real‐world proficiency to characterize a complex information and provide a better glimpse to confront uncertainty and ambiguity when compared with those of the fuzzy set. Moreover, rough sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets deal with the specific aspects of the same problem & imprecision, and their combination IF rough set has been studied by many researchers in the past few years. The present chapter deals with a review of IF rough set theory, their basic concepts, properties, topological structures, logic operators, approximation operators and similarity relations on the basis of axiomatic and constructive approaches. The characterization of IF rough sets based on various operators, similarity relations, distances, IF cut sets, IF coverings and inclusion degrees is also discussed. Moreover, several extensions of IF rough sets and their hybridization with other extended rough set theories are thoroughly surveyed. The applications of IF rough sets in different real‐world problems are also discussed in detail.

 With the growth in the living standard of people, food safety and quality risk assessment has gradually become the focus. Therefore, this article realizes the dynamic risk assessment of food safety based on an improved hidden Markov model (HMM) integrating the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) (CS-HMM). The CS is used to conduct global search to obtain the initial value of HMM, and then the Baum–Welch algorithm is used for modifying the initial value to obtain a trained risk assessment model. Finally, in terms of several benchmark functions, the accuracy of the CS algorithm is better than the PSO and the GA algorithms for seeking global optimal solution. Moreover, the presented method is applied to evaluate the safety risk of the sterilized milk production. Combined with the characteristics of time and temperature, the deterioration reasons of sterilized milk are analyzed. Moreover, the proposed method has certain theoretical significance and practical value for improving the ability of food quality risk assessment and formulating control measures in advance. Practical applications The presented method is applied to evaluate the safety risk of the sterilized milk production, which are supplied by the food inspection agency of Guizhou province in China. Combined with the characteristics of time and temperature, the deterioration reasons of sterilized milk are analyzed. Furthermore, the improved model breaks out of the local optimal limit, so as to better realize the risk prediction of food and obtain better evaluation results. Based on the analysis of dynamic risk assessment result with the temperature characteristics, the future risk trend can be predicted. Meanwhile, the causes affecting the deterioration of the sterilized milk and the direction to improve the quality of the sterilized milk can be obtained. In this way, risk control measures can be taken more precisely and risks can be reduced more effectively, which is helpful to the production and storage of food products.

 q‐Rung orthopair fuzzy sets‐based decision‐theoretic rough sets for three‐way decisions under group decision making    
   
 Article    
 Sep 2019 

 Decui Liang 
  Wen Cao 
    
 As an extension of Pythagorean fuzzy sets, the q‐rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q‐ROFSs) can easily solve uncertain information in a broader perspective. Considering the fine property of q‐ROFSs, we introduce q‐ROFSs into decision‐theoretic rough sets (DTRSs) and use it to portray the loss function. According to the Bayesian decision procedure, we further construct a basic model of q‐rung orthopair fuzzy decision‐theoretic rough sets (q‐ROFDTRSs) under the q‐rung orthopair fuzzy environment. At the same time, we design the corresponding method for the deduction of three‐way decisions by utilizing projection‐based distance measures and TOPSIS. Then, we extend q‐ROFDTRSs to adapt the group decision‐making (GDM) scenario. To fuse different experts’ evaluation results, we propose some new aggregation operators of q‐ROFSs by utilizing power average (PA) and power geometric (PG) operators, that is, q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power average, q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power weighted average (q‐ROFPWA), q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power geometric, and q‐rung orthopair fuzzy power weighted geometric (q‐ROFPWG). In addition, with the aid of q‐ROFPWA and q‐ROFPWG, we investigate three‐way decisions with q‐ROFDTRSs under the GDM situation. Finally, we give the example of a rural e‐commence GDM problem to illustrate the application of our proposed method and verify our results by conducting two comparative experiments.

 Method Evaluation, Parametrization, and Result Validation in Unsupervised Data Mining: A Critical Survey    
   
 Article    
 Full-text available    
 Jul 2019 

 Albrecht Zimmermann 
    
 Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) build tools intended to help users solve data‐related problems that are infeasible for “unaugmented” humans. Tools need manuals, however, and in the case of ML/DM methods, this means guidance with respect to which technique to choose, how to parameterize it, and how to interpret derived results to arrive at knowledge about the phenomena underlying the data. While such information is available in the literature, it has not yet been collected in one place. We survey three types of work for clustering and pattern mining: (1) comparisons of existing techniques, (2) evaluations of different parameterization options and studies providing guidance for setting parameter values, and (3) work comparing mining results with the ground truth. We find that although interesting results exist, as a whole the body of work on these questions is too limited. In addition, we survey recent studies in the field of community detection, as a contrasting example. We argue that an objective obstacle for performing needed studies is a lack of data and survey the state of available data, pointing out certain limitations. As a solution, we propose to augment existing data by artificially generated data, review the state‐of‐the‐art in data generation in unsupervised mining, and identify shortcomings. In more general terms, we call for the development of a true “Data Science” that—based on work in other domains, results in ML, and existing tools—develops needed data generators and builds up the knowledge needed to effectively employ unsupervised mining techniques.

 Evolving Granular Systems    
   
 Thesis    
 Full-text available

 Daniel F. Leite 
    
 In recent years there has been increasing interest in computational modeling approaches to deal with real-world data streams. Methods and algorithms have been proposed to uncover meaningful knowledge from very large (often unbounded) data sets in principle with no apparent value. This thesis introduces a framework for evolving granular modeling of uncertain data streams. Evolving granular systems comprise an array of online modeling approaches inspired by the way in which humans deal with complexity. These systems explore the information flow in dynamic environments and derive from it models that can be linguistically understood. Particularly, information granulation is a natural technique to dispense unnecessary details and emphasize transparency, interpretability and scalability of information systems. Uncertain (granular) data arise from imprecise perception or description of the value of a variable. Broadly stated, various factors can affect one's choice of data representation such that the representing object conveys the meaning of the concept it is being used to represent. Of particular concern to this work are numerical, interval, and fuzzy types of granular data; and interval, fuzzy, and neurofuzzy modeling frameworks. Learning in evolving granular systems is based on incremental algorithms that build model structure from scratch on a per-sample basis and adapt model parameters whenever necessary. This learning paradigm is meaningful once it avoids redesigning and retraining models all along if the system changes. Application examples in classification, function approximation, time-series prediction and control using real and synthetic data illustrate the usefulness of the granular approaches and framework proposed. The behavior of nonstationary data streams with gradual and abrupt regime shifts is also analyzed in the realm of evolving granular computing. We shed light upon the role of interval, fuzzy, and neurofuzzy computing in processing uncertain data and providing high-quality approximate solutions and rule summary of input-output data sets. The approaches and framework introduced constitute a natural extension of evolving intelligent systems over numeric data streams to evolving granular systems over granular data streams.

 Soft clustering    
   
 Article

 Maria Brigida Ferraro 
  Paolo Giordani 
    
 Clustering is one of the most used tools in data analysis. In the last decades, due to the increasing complexity of data, soft clustering has received a great deal of attention. There exist different approaches that can be considered as soft. The most known is the fuzzy approach that consists in assigning objects to clusters with membership degrees, depending on the dissimilarities between each object and all the prototypes, ranging in the unit interval. Closely related to the fuzzy approach, there is the possibilistic one that, differently from the previous one, relaxes some constraints on the membership degrees. In particular, the objects are assigned to clusters with degrees of typicalities, depending just on the dissimilarities between each object and the closest prototype. A further soft approach is the rough one. In this case, there are not degrees ranging between 0 and 1 but objects with intermediate features belong to the boundary region and are assigned to more than one cluster. Even if it is not universally recognized in the scientific community as an approach of soft clustering, from our point of view, the model‐based approach can also be considered as such. Model‐based clustering methods also produce a soft partition of the objects and the posterior probability of a component membership may play a role similar to the membership degree. The four approaches are critically described from a theoretical point of view and an empirical comparative analysis is carried out. This article is categorized under: Statistical Learning and Exploratory Methods of the Data Sciences > Clustering and Classification Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis > Multivariate Analysis Statistical Learning and Exploratory Methods of the Data Sciences > Exploratory Data Analysis Abstract Soft clustering methods: fuzzy, possibilistic, rough, and model‐based approaches

   Motivation        
   
 Show Motivation    
 Inductive programming addresses the problem of learning programs from incomplete specifications - typically from input/output examples. Beginning in the 1960s, this area of research was initiated in artificial intelligence exploring the complex cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification. Inductive programming can be seen as a subdomain of machine learning where the hypothesis space consists of classes of computer programs. Researchers working on this topic have their background in diverse areas of computer science, namely in machine learning, artificial intelligence, declarative programming, program verification, and software engineering. Furthermore, inductive programming is of interest for researchers in cognitive science, working on computational models of inductive learning from experience, and for researchers in education, especially in intelligent tutoring. A break-through from basic research to applications for the mass-market was achieved by applying inductive programming techniques to programming by examples support of end-users for Microsoft Excel (Flashfill). This Dagstuhl Seminar is planned as a continuation of Dagstuhl Seminars 13502, 15442, and 17382. In the first seminar, focus was on exploring the different areas of basic research and applications of inductive programming. In the second seminar, in-depth coverage of algorithmic methods was provided and the relation to cognitive modeling was explored. In the third seminar focus was on different application areas such as data cleansing, teaching programming, and interactive training.  
 In the fourth seminar, focus will be on the potential of inductive programming  
 as an approach to explainable AI, 
  for support in data science, 
  in relation to neural computation, especially deep networks, and 
  as a special style of human-like computing.

  Summary        
   
 Show Summary    
 Inductive programming addresses the automated or semi-automated generation of computer programs from incomplete information such as input-output examples, constraints, computation traces, demonstrations, or problem-solving experience [11]. The generated – typically declarative – program has the status of a hypothesis which has been generalized by induction. That is, inductive programming can be seen as a special approach to machine learning. In contrast to standard machine learning, only a small number of training examples is necessary. Furthermore, learned hypotheses are represented as logic or functional programs, that is they are represented on symbol level and therefore are inspectable and comprehensible [36, 15, 37, 29]. On the other hand, inductive programming is a special approach to program synthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches [39, 25, 4]. In cases where synthesis of specific algorithm details that are hard to figure out by humans inductive reasoning can be used to generate program candidates from either user-provided data such as test cases or from data automatically derived from a formal specification [35]. Finally symbolic approaches can be combined with probabilistic methods [8, 9].  
 Inductive program synthesis is of interest for researchers in artificial intelligence since the late sixties [2]. On the one hand, the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code which satisfies some specification are investigated, on the other hand methodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process are explored. One of the most relevant areas of application of inductive programming techniques is end-user programming [5, 22, 6]. For example, the Microsoft Excel plug-in Flashfill synthesizes programs from a small set of observations of user behavior [15, 14, 13]. Related applications are in process mining and in data wrangling [19, 21]. Inductive programming in general offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data [30, 23] and to learning from observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents [28, 20, 36]. Furthermore inductive programming can be applied in the context of teaching programming [38, 41]. A recent new domain of interest is how to combine inductive programming with blackbox approaches, especially in the context of (deep) neural networks [10] and in data science.  
 Relation to Previous Dagstuhl-Seminars  
 The seminar is a continuation Dagstuhl-Seminars 13502, 15442, and 17382. In the first seminar, the focus was on establishing the research community by exploring the different areas of basic research and applications of inductive programming and identifying commonalities and differences in methods and goals. In the second seminar, more in-depth coverage of algorithmic methods was provided and the relation of inductive programming to cognitive modeling was explored. The third seminar had a main focus on applications in data cleansing teaching programming, and interactive training. Furthermore, first proposals for neural approaches to learning for inductive programming were presented.  
 Besides many new insights from many discussions, visible outcomes from the previous seminars are:

  For the fourth seminar, we extend our invitation to researchers from deep learning and to researchers addressing statistical machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. The focus of the fourth seminar has been on the potential of inductive programming for explainable AI, especially in combination with (deep) neural networks and with data science.   
 Inductive Programming as a Approach to Explainable AI  
 Recently it has been recognized that explainability is crucial for machine learning to be usable in real world domains – especially such where erroneous decisions might be harmful to humans. Consequently, interfaces which explain (aspects) of classifier decisions have been proposed – especially in the context of deep learning [32, 3]. The notion of explainability has already been addressed in the early days of machine learning: During the 1980s Michie defined Machine Learning in terms of two orthogonal axes of performance: predictive accuracy and comprehensibility of generated hypotheses. Since predictive accuracy was readily measurable and comprehensibility not so, later definitions in the 1990s, such as that of Mitchell [27], tended to use a one-dimensional approach to Machine Learning based solely on predictive accuracy, ultimately favouring statistical over symbolic Machine Learning approaches.  
 Inductive Programming and Neural Computation  
 The deep learning community has been interested in taking on challenging tasks from the artificial intelligence community. It is therefore no surprise that they have also started to look into inductive and automatic programming. In particular, they have contributed several mixtures of traditional computational models with those of neural networks. For instance the neural Turing machine [12] integrates a neural network with an external memory and it is able to learn simple algorithms such as copy and sort, the neural program interpreter [31] is a recurrent neural network that learns to represent and execute programs from program traces while [33] present an end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth and [34, 24] for a declarative Prolog like language. The central goal in these approaches is to obtain an end-to-end differentiable model. While initial results are promising, the approaches still require a lot of data to be trained or need to scale up. This contrasts with the more traditional symbolic approaches to inductive programming and thus a key opportunity is to further cross-fertalize these two approaches.  
 Inductive Programming and Human-like Computing  
 The human ability to master complex demands is to a large extend based on the ability to exploit previous experiences. Based on our experience, we are able to predict characteristics or reactions of (natural or man-made, inanimate or animate) objects, we can reason about possible outcomes of actions, and we can apply previously successful routines and strategies to new tasks and problems. In philosophy, psychology and artificial intelligence, researchers proposed that the core process to expand knowledge, that is, construct hypotheses, in such a way that we can transfer knowledge from previous experience to new situations is inductive inference [18, 16, 40].  
 One special aspect of induction is that humans are able to acquire complex, productive rule sets from experience. Following Chomsky, rules are productive when they can be applied in situations of various complexity. Typical examples of such rule sets are knowledge about natural language grammar, recursive concepts such as ancestor and recursive problem solving strategies. For example, if humans have learned how to solve Tower of Hanoi problems with three and four discs, at least some of them are able to generalize the underlying strategy for solving problems with an arbitrary number of discs.  
 Inductive programming provides mechanisms to generate such productive, recursive rule sets. Examples of recent work on using inductive programming to model this learningcapability of human cognition are [26, 20, 36, 17, 23]. Therefore, it might be fruitful for cognitive scientists to get acquainted with inductive programming as one approach to model the acquisition of complex knowledge structures. On the other hand, knowledge gained from experiments in human problem solving, concept learning and language acquisition can be a source of inspiration for new algorithmic approaches to inductive programming.  
 Objectives and Expected Outcomes of the Seminar  
 The previous seminars resulted in new collaborations between researchers from different backgrounds as documented in joint publications and we expect that the collaborations will continue, deepen and extend, resulting not only in further joint publications but also in joint research projects.  
 In the fourth seminar, we continued and extended previous discussions addressing the following aspects:  
 Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches are more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning and probabilistic programming. Focus here is on possibilities of combining (deep) neural approaches or probabilistic programming with (symbolic) inductive programming, especially with respect to new approaches to comprehensibility of machine learned models and on explainable AI. 
  Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems. 
  Discussing current applications of inductive programming in end-user programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application. 
  Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming under the label of human-like computation. 
  Strengthening the relation of inductive programming and data science, especially with respect to data cleansing and data wrangling. 
  Concluding Remarks and Future Plans  
 In the wrapping-up section, we decided to move the IP webpage to a Wiki and encouraged all participants to make available their systems, tutorial/lecture slides and publications there. As the grand IP challenge we came up with 2017 is still up:  
 An IP program should invent an algorithm publishable in a serious journal (e.g., an integer factorization algorithm) or win a programming competition!
