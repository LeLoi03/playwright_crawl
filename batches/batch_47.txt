1. Conference ISRR_3:
WELCOME!  
  
 We are looking forward to welcome the global root research community for ISRR 12 in Leipzig, Germany. The meeting will foster the exchange and provide a platform for discussion of new discoveries and developments and will be held in person. In addition, we will stream the plenary lectures for those who can’t make it. The transmission may be accessed here.   
 We are looking forward seeing you all again following the disruptions through the pandemic.  

 GENERAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE MEETING  
  
 The program will reflect the three most important global challenges facing society today, climate change, biodiversity loss, and food security, and demonstrate the fundamental role root research has in helping solve these problems. Some of the big questions we will pose are: how are roots affected by climate change, how do roots adapt and hence mitigate negative impacts. Do we lose root functional diversity with declining agrobiodiversity? How is the root associated microbiome and fauna changing and what does this mean for ecosystem functions and resilience of systems? What do roots contribute to exploration and exploitation of resources and hence to resource use efficiency, resilience and sustainability of food and fibre production? What is the contribution of roots to avoiding soil degradation or reconstitution of healthy soils?  
  
 The answer to all these questions requires a joint effort of the root research community and a mutual exchange of chemists, biologists, physicists, modellers working in different ecosystems at different scales, i.e. from lab to field, from local to global. There is a need to inform each other about the latest methodological developments and advances in process understanding. However, there is likewise a need to improve data integration, system understanding and to develop strategies to contribute as a community to the global issues. This will be the challenge of ISRR 12 and we invite you all to help us rise to it.

 ISSDQ  
 In this symposium we aim to address urban issues of spatial data quality, as they relate to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in the presence of big data. Deep learning requires high quality data to result in high quality results. In order to tune the workshop, we like to focus on one specific study area, and for the GSW 2021 the target is the city of Dubai, being a modern city with an old core that is rapidly developing and where both 2- and 3-dimensional spatial information can be collected. Such an urban area is of interest in scaling from the household through the neighborhood to the whole city and its environment, within-city spatial variability and uses of data for decision support. In the frame of the workshop also the big data companies, such as google, will be invited to participate. We further see scope for having a stakeholder event where typical governmental and planning agencies will be invited. Finally, we aim to have specific attention to ethical issues of spatial data quality, like questioning the fitness for specific uses.

 Call for Papers - Research Track  
  
 ISSRE (International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering) is the leading conference on software reliability and it focuses on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.  
 The research track at ISSRE 2024 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results exploring new scientific ideas, contributing new evidence to established research directions, or reflecting on practical experience. Specifically, ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories: (1) full research regular (REG) papers, (2) practical experience reports (PER), and (3) tools and artefacts (TAR) papers. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category.  
 REG papers should describe a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems. Novelty should be argued via concrete evidence and appropriate positioning within the state of the art. REG papers are also expected to clearly explain the validation process and its limitations. 
  PER papers should provide an in-depth exposition of practical experiences ideally performed by a collaboration of researchers and industry practitioners. The key contribution of these papers should be lessons learned from the application of known research tools and methods related to ISSRE topics, or new knowledge acquired through empirical studies performed according to various research methodologies. Negative results are welcome, e.g., discussing where or why current research cannot be applied in an industrially relevant context. 
  TAR papers should describe a new tool or artefact. Tool-focused TAR papers must present either a new tool or novel and substantial extensions to an existing tool. They should include a description of (i) the theoretical foundations, (ii) the design and implementation aspects, and (iii) experiments with realistic case studies. Making the tool publicly available is strongly encouraged. Artefact-focused TAR papers should cover (i) a working copy of the software and (ii) experimental data sets. 
  The ISSRE conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Authors are encouraged to disclose data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Should the paper be accepted, the authors will have the opportunity (and are encouraged to) submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) track, to enhance the reproducibility and quality of your research. By submitting your artifacts, you not only contribute to the progress of our field but also stand a chance to earn badges that will be displayed on your papers in the conference proceedings, showcasing the credibility and rigor of your work.  
 At least one author of every accepted paper is required to make a full author registration and present at the conference physically in Tsukuba.  
 Special issues   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue of the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  journal. The Call for Paper is available here: https://link.springer.com/journal/10664/updates/27347036   
 Important dates (AoE)   
 Paper submission deadline: | May 15th, 2024 (AoE) | May 10th, 2024 (AoE) 
  Author rebuttal period: July 5th-July 8th, 2024 (AoE) 
  Notification to authors: July 26th, 2024 (AoE) 
  Camera ready papers: August 23rd, 2024 (AoE) 
  Paper Categories   
 Submissions can be made in one of the following.  
 REG papers: 12 pages (including references). 
  PER papers: 12 pages (including references). 
  TAR papers: 6 - 10 pages (including references). 
  Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review.  
 Topics of Interest   
 Topics of interest include development, analysis methods and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to:  
 Dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability 
  Reliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures 
  Reliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting) 
  Software testing and formal methods 
  Software fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis 
  Metrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security 
  Reliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems 
  Reliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering 
  Reliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability 
  Reliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS) 
  Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software 
  Reliability of open-source software 
  Reliability of software dealing with Big Data 
  Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software 
  Reliability of green and sustainable systems 
  Reliability of mobile systems 
  Reliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain, networks softwarization, 5G/6G, edge-to-cloud computing) 
  Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability 
  Societal aspects of software reliability 
  Anonymizing Rules   
 Authors shall anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgements). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, the names of case study subjects may be left un-anonymized, if the subject name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. In that case, they should avoid mentioning that a specific tool has been conceived and developed by them, as well as a paper that has been co-authored by them. The authors can provide the name of a case study subject software and the name of the entity developing it (private company or foundations); in case some of the authors are employees of the developing entity, the authors should not explicitly mention their affiliation but clarify potential threats to validity (e.g., familiarity with the subject), as appropriate.  
 Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page 
  Remove acknowledgement of identifying names and funding sources 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., | Joe.Smith.dvi | , are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: | "Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2023]." | with the corresponding citation: | "[Anonymous 2023] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  It is within the authors to use a non-anonymized version of the submitted work to, e.g., discuss it with colleagues, give talks, and publish it at ArXiV, but, in doing so, the authors cannot mention that the work is under submission to ISSRE 2024. 
  Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded.  
 Formatting Rules   
 Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines  as implemented by the following LaTeX/Word templates:  
 LaTex Package | (ZIP) 
  Word Template | (DOCX) 
  Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of success. Please take a note of the following:  
 Submissions should be anonymous. 
  The first page must include the title of the paper and a maximum 200-word abstract. 
  Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers. Thus, describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them. 
  The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (i.e., it has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. 
  The use of color for figures and graphs is allowed only if the paper turns out to be readable if printed in grayscale. 
  Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. 
  Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB. 
  Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and better understand their results.  
 Paper Submission   
 Papers are submitted via Easychair at the following URL: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2024   
 Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee through a double-blind reviewing process, with a limited use of outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.  
 Changes in the number and order of authors will not be allowed after the paper acceptance.  
 Authors must anonymize their submissions according to the guidelines given above. Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.  
 Review Process and Author Response   
 After the papers have been reviewed, but before the Program Committee/Board meeting, the reviews will be made available to the authors to respond to any factual errors in the reviews. Rebuttals do not include additional information about the research or a submission of an updated or revised paper. Author responses will be made available to all PC/PB members before the paper is discussed for selection in the PC/PB meeting. The submissions website will include rebuttal guidelines.  
 Best Research Paper Award   
 ISSRE is pleased to announce the Best Research Paper Award, attributed every year to the best paper in the Research Track.  
 Conference Proceedings   
 The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS). Papers presented at the conference will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and to all of the A&I (abstracting and indexing) partners (such as the EI Compendex).  
 IEEE Conference Publishing Policies   
 All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies < Submission Policies - IEEE Author Center Conferences  >.  
 IEEE Cross Check   
 All submissions will be screened for plagiarized material through the IEEE Cross Check portal.

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.

   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

 This call is an open invitation to scientists and professionals working in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology to submit high quality proposals for Tutorials at ISMB/ECCB 2025.  
 - top -   
  Tutorial Program at ISMB/ECCB 2025   
 The purpose of the Tutorials program is to build knowledge and provide hands-on training in "cutting-edge" topics relevant to the bioinformatics field and the COSI communities. Tutorials offer participants an opportunity to get an introduction to important established topics in bioinformatics, to learn about new areas of bioinformatics research, or to develop advanced skills in areas about which they are already knowledgeable.  
 Tutorials may include any form of presentation such as brief talks or panel discussions but should include hands-on exercises. Tutorials serve an educational function  and are expected to provide a balanced perspective on a field of research. They should not focus on the presenters' own research or software, unless balanced with other tools in the same realm. However, tutorials on broadly used bioinformatics tools will be considered. Please note that if you wish to focus your talk on a demo of a specific software package, your proposal should be submitted to the Technology Track.  
 Potential topic areas (a list of Tutorials presented in 2024 is available here  ) may include but are not limited to the following:  
 Data analysis topics: 
  Single-cell 
  Multiomics integration 
  Spatial transciptomics 
  Metagenomics 
  Proteomics 
  Alphafold and/or Structural biology 
  any other life sciences data 
  Data visualization for bioinformatics 
  AI and Machine Learning for bioinformatics 
  Translational informatics: Opportunities for bioinformatics in the clinical realm 
  How to make your software sustainable and reusable for open access or commercial usage 
  Biological sciences for bioinformaticians (eg aimed at Comp-science graduates with less/no prior biology knowledge) 
  Workflow tools (eg Snakemake, NextFlow) 
  Bioinformatics on cloud platforms 
  Best practices (eg learning github, using pytorch, Python coding standard PEP8 etc) 
  - top -   
  Tutorials organization   
 Tutorials can be planned to be either in-person at the ACC Liverpool or fully online, but should not be hybrid. (eg. tutorial presenters and participants should either be fully online or in-person). There is a set limit on the number of in-person tutorials but less limit on the number of selected virtual tutorials.  
   
  Tutorials presented in-person will be held on July 20, 2025. Tutorials presented online will be held on a weekday (TBD) prior to the conference start. If submitting an online tutorial proposal you will be asked to confirm your preferred time zone for presentation.

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

 ISSTA 2025  
   
 Welcome to the website of the ISSTA 2025 conference.  
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
 2025 will mark the 34th edition of ISSTA!  

 Research Papers: Call for Papers  
 View track page for all details   
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  About   
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.

A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

  Call for Papers 
  About   
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  About   
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  About   
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

 Call for Papers: Special Issue on Socio-Technical Ecosystem Considerations: Threats and Opportunities for AI in Cybersecurity   
 By Katina Michael  on October 5th, 2021 in Artificial Intelligence (AI)  , Call for Papers  , Call for Papers  , Ethics  , Social Implications of Technology  , Societal Impact  , Transactions   
  
 An element of the expansion of digital technologies is a shift in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology from research laboratories into the hands of anyone with a smartphone. AI powered search, personalization and automation are being deployed across sectors, from education to healthcare, to policing, to finance. Wide AI diffusion is then reshaping the way organizations, communities and individuals’ function. The potentially radical consequences of AI have pushed nation states across the globe to publish strategies on how they seek to shape, drive and leverage the disruptive capabilities offered by AI technologies to bolster their prosperity and security.

 ISTAS 2024 Wraps, ISTAS 2025 Location and Date Announced: September 10-12, 2025, Santa Clara, CA  
 By terribookman  on September 30th, 2024 in Articles  , Artificial Intelligence (AI)  , Blog Posts  , Conferences  , Environment  , Ethics  , Human Impacts  , Social Implications of Technology  , Societal Impact  , Standards   

 The 2024 IEEE Symposium on Technology and Society concluded on Friday September 20, 2024, in Puebla, Mexico, with continued paper tracks, invited and keynote talks, and a panel moderated by SSIT Board member Bozenna Pasik-Duncan on “WIE: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.”   
 Ruth Lewis, Chair of the IEEE SSIT Standards Committee, along with Maike Luiken and David Gonzalez also gave an Invited Talk titled “Best Practices Guide to Developing Ethically Aligned and Environmentally Sustainable Standards.”  

 Bozenna Pasik-Duncan led the WIE: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion panel.  
 In addition to moderator Pasik-Duncan, the WIE: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion panel members were Morgan Kiani, Ruth Lewis, Mariela Lozada, Karen Tovar Parra, and Kelly McKenna. The need to increase the number of women in STEM professions was an overriding theme of the panel. Karen Tovar Parra noted four primary contributors to glass ceilings for women: lack of role models, bias in hiring and promotion, the wage gap, and imposter syndrome. She said that IEEE has a role to play with improving diversity in STEM professions including AI, including with a professional code of conduct based on merit and capability, equal pay, and equitable hiring. But, she noted, “the total percentage of women in IEEE never changes,” and remains at about 12%.  
 Details of the next International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS 2025) were released at the close of ISTAS 2024. 2025 Conference Chair Maureen Vavra announced that the ISTAS25 will be held at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, CA, September 10-12, 2025, and themed AI Evolution and Revolution. Current projected tracks are: Ethics and Governance, Healthcare and Biomedicine, Future of Work and Industry, Environmental Sustainability, and Culture, Arts and Society.

 Call for Papers: Special Issue on Socio-Technical Ecosystem Considerations: Threats and Opportunities for AI in Cybersecurity   
 By Katina Michael  on October 5th, 2021 in Artificial Intelligence (AI)  , Call for Papers  , Call for Papers  , Ethics  , Social Implications of Technology  , Societal Impact  , Transactions   
  
 An element of the expansion of digital technologies is a shift in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology from research laboratories into the hands of anyone with a smartphone. AI powered search, personalization and automation are being deployed across sectors, from education to healthcare, to policing, to finance. Wide AI diffusion is then reshaping the way organizations, communities and individuals’ function. The potentially radical consequences of AI have pushed nation states across the globe to publish strategies on how they seek to shape, drive and leverage the disruptive capabilities offered by AI technologies to bolster their prosperity and security.

 Call for Papers  
  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions is expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience. Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of software testing and analysis methods or tools.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artifact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 In particular, replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently. This means that it is also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artifacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artifacts the study is built on, and to submit those artifacts to the artifact evaluation  . Artifacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Two Submission Deadlines and Major Revisions   
 ISSTA 2024 features two submission deadlines. The instructions in this call apply to both deadlines. You can choose to submit at either deadline. Only papers submitted to the first deadline may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the second deadline. Papers submitted to the second deadline will be either accepted or rejected, i.e., there is no option for a major revision.  
 Papers that are rejected during the first round may not be resubmitted to the second round  . Authors who try to bypass this rule (e.g., by changing the paper title without significantly changing paper content, or by making small changes to the paper content) will have their papers desk-rejected without further consideration. Papers rejected from the first or second submission round can, of course, be submitted to ISSTA 2025 without any restrictions.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors are acknowledging that that all co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of the paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Research Papers, Experience Papers, and Replicability Studies should be at most 10 pages in length, with at most 2 additional pages for references only. The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 10 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission, e.g., “XXX (Experience Paper)”. All authors should use the official “ACM Master article template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template  pages. Latex users should use the “sigconf” option, as well as the “review” (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and “anonymous” (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following Latex code can be placed at the start of the Latex document:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,review, anonymous]{acmart} \acmConference[ISSTA 2024]{ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis}{16-20 September, 2024}{Vienna, Austria}   Submit your papers via the HotCRP ISSTA 2024 submission website  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews during a rebuttal period. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chair may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The authors will have a chance to read the additional reviews and respond to them during the additional short response period. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2024 will conduct double-blind reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors have the right to upload preprints on arXiv or similar sites, but they must avoid specifying that the paper was submitted to ISSTA.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles, and encourage all contributing authors to disclose data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee, or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Data must be shared in an anonymized way (e.g., no information on authors/affiliations in the code) via a site that reveals neither the authors’ nor the reviewers’ identities (e.g., not via Google Drive). At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.  
 Publication Date   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  About   
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  About   
 The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.  
 NEW THIS YEAR  : The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artefacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Major Revisions   
 Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy  and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.  
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}   
 Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  
 The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-anonymous Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

 Submission  
 Submissions for the main symposium or a special track must be in PDF file format (20MB max size). Authors will be able to update/change their paper submission(s) before the deadline. All information submitted must be error free, as it will be used for reviewing purposes and to generate the final symposium program and proceedings. During submission, you will be asked to select some research topics (including special tracks) that best fit your paper(s). Please, carefully choose these topics as they will be used by the system to find qualified reviewers for your paper(s).  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee (PC) using a “double-blind” review process to determine its appropriateness for acceptance and presentation (oral or poster) at ISVC. Therefore, paper submissions should not contain names or other information revealing authors’ identity  .  
 A complete paper should be submitted in camera-ready format for review purposes. The length should match that intended for final publication. Papers accepted for the symposium will be allocated 12 pages in the proceedings (including references), with the option of purchasing up to 2 extra pages for $100 per page. If you are unwilling or unable to pay the extra charge you should limit yourself to 12 pages. Otherwise the page limit is 14 pages. All paper submissions will be handled electronically through our online web submission system.  
 Review  
 This is a fully refereed symposium. Papers submitted to ISVC must not have been previously published and must not be currently under consideration for publication in another conference. Submissions will be reviewed with an emphasis on potential to contribute to the state of the art in the field. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and presentation quality. The form of presentation (oral or poster) will be decided based on the reviews of each submission and recommendation of the program chairs and the steering committee.  
 ChatGPT policy:  ChatGPT can be used for proofreading assistance but NOT  for manuscript writing, manufacturing of data, results, and arguments. Strong suspicion of violation of the above policy will result in automatically rejecting the submission.  
 Attendance  
 ISVC is a premier forum for presenting and discussing current research in visual computing. At least one author must attend and present the paper at the symposium. If no author can attend the symposium and present their paper(s) due to unforeseen reasons, they should contact the steering committee chair to make alternative arrangements (i.e., video presentation or presentation by another attendee).  Papers not presented at the symposium without a valid reason will be withdrawn from the symposium proceedings.   
 Publication  
 All papers, regardless to the form of presentation (i.e., oral or poster), will appear in the symposium proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). In submitting a paper the author(s) agree that, upon acceptance, they will prepare the final manuscript in time for inclusion into the symposium proceedings, attend the symposium in person, and present the paper.  
 Formatting  
 To format your paper, follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) guidelines and technical instructions  closely. Springer will eventually re-format all papers to produce the camera-ready pdf versions using the same formatting instructions. Therefore, if an author has squashed his or her paper by removing vertical spaces or changing font sizes, etc., the final pdf will cover more pages and additional page charges will apply.  
 Color Pages  
 There is no charge for color pages in the on-line  paper proceedings. Color figures in the printed  paper proceedings cost between 250 Euros per page on average and must be explicitly requested during registration (i.e., email admin@isvc.net).  
 Camera-Ready Manuscripts  
 Papers will be published both in printed proceedings and online. Since papers would need to be reformatted, besides submitting the pdf version of your paper, you would also need to submit ALL  files needed for generating the pdf file, for example:  
 (1) the tex-file(s) including any special style files you may have used,  
  (2) all images and illustrations in PostScript and/or PDF, and the final document in  
  (3) DVI (or Word doc and rtf file),  
  (4) PostScript and  
  (5) PDF formats.  
 Create a single gzipped tar-file or a ZIP archive file containing all files. Specific instructions where to upload your gzipped file will be provided at a later time.  
 As noted earlier, Springer will re-produce the final pdf version of all papers. They will contact you by email at a later time (i.e., after 3-4 weeks) for final approval of your paper(s). The e-mail will come from India and will have attachments (i.e., make sure that your spam filter does not reject it!!).  
 Copyright form  
 The copyright form can be downloaded from the LNCS web site  . It must be signed by at least one author to publish the paper in Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science. Papers without signed copyright form will not be included in the proceedings. Please sign the form and submit it along with your final paper materials. In the “Editors” field, please put “Bebis et al.”

 The IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society and the world’s premier forum for researchers in the active fields of theory, design and implementation of circuits and systems. ISCAS 2025 will be held in London, UK, from May 25 to 28. The IEEE ISCAS 2025 Organizing Committee invites proposals for Live Demonstrations to be held during the conference. The live demonstrations will be carried out in presentation booths with ample space to set up a working system, whether it is an interactive software on a laptop, a hardware setup, or a system acquiring signals from a human. Conference attendees are invited to experience the demonstrations directly, to interact with and challenge them.  
 Authors are invited to submit a one-page demo description using the same page formatting as for regular ISCAS papers. The one-page demo description can be based on either already published paper as a demo for the first time or new paper submitted to ISCAS 2025. During submission of the one-page demo description, authors should select “Live Demonstrations” as the Primary Track and an appropriate topical subtract as the Secondary Track.  

 October 28, 2024    Live Demo Submission Deadline - Final Extension 
  January 20, 2025    Notification of Acceptance 

 One-page Demo Description  
 The one-page demo description must contain the following information: Demonstration Title and Reference: The demonstration title must begin with “Live Demonstration:”. If the one-page demo description is based on already published paper, please include at least one reference to your published paper about the scientific background of your live demonstration, and this will not be considered as violation to double-blind review policy. The reference must be easily accessible for the reviewers, a URL is highly recommended! If the one page demo description is based on new paper submitted to ISCAS 2025, please include the submission ID of your ISCAS paper in the demo description. 
  Demonstration Setup: Describe the equipment you will bring to ISCAS 2025. Include a photograph and/or screenshot. Only a power plug, a table and display stand will be provided. Demonstrators are responsible for the transportation of their own equipment to the meeting site. Indicate any special requirements such as extra space for demonstrating robotic movement or other requirements which the organizers should be aware of. 
  Visitor Experience: Explain the way in which a visitor experiences and interacts with your demonstration, how it reveals the essence of your work, furthers understanding, and what the visitor will learn. 
  Optional Video: For the initial submission only, authors can also include an optional link to a video (max 5min) about their demo. This video is only meant to facilitate the review process, and does not substitute for the live demo.

  Aerial view of the University of British Columbia Vancouver BC, Canada. Image credit: UBC   This symposium is dedicated to the understanding and characterization of workloads that run on all types of computing systems. New applications and programming paradigms continue to emerge rapidly as the diversity and performance of computers increase. On one hand, improvements in computing technology are usually based on a solid understanding and analysis of existing workloads. On the other hand, computing workloads evolve and change with advances in microarchitecture, compilers, programming languages, and networking communication technologies. Whether they are smart phones and deeply embedded systems at the low end or massively parallel systems at the high end, the design of future computing machines can be significantly improved if we understand the characteristics of the workloads that are expected to run on them.  
 This symposium, sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and the Technical Committee on Computer Architecture, will focus on characterizing and understanding emerging applications in consumer, commercial and scientific computing.

 Secure Federated Distillation Framework for Encrypted Traffic Classification  
  Abstract   
 Encrypted traffic classification is essential for cyberspace governance. However, due to the privacy issues associated with network traffic, most organizations, such as hospitals, government agencies, and universities, are reluctant to disclose their network traffic. Malicious users can spread illegal information or commit cybercrime on the intranet via VPN or TOR. In this paper, we adopt federated learning to provide a new solution for encrypted traffic classification in darknet. Meanwhile, we introduce federated distillation to solve the problems of excessive communication overhead and Non-IID data. In addition, secret sharing is used for privacy federated distillation. By introducing sharpening coefficients, we effectively improve the robustness of the framework against data poisoning attacks and Byzantine attacks under an honest majority. We conduct extensive experiments on public dataset ISCX CICDarknet2020 and real dataset DarkCSE2023 containing popular application traffic, including VPN and Tor. Experiments show that our proposed framework achieves precision of 96.63%  and recall of 96.76%  in centralized setting, precision of 90.02%  , and recall of 89.60%  in federated setting, which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

 TriNT: A Framework for ROV Identification Based on Triplet  
  Abstract   
 The inter-domain routing system of the Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASes), with their security mechanisms affecting the overall security of the Internet. Route Origin Validation (ROV) is a security technique for curbing malicious attacks against the routing system. The use of ROV by ASes is the basis for studying many aspects of the Internet, such as assessing Internet security and robustness. Previous research for passively measuring the status of ROV operation have been limited to specific types of ASes, such as Vantage Points (VPs) or stub ASes. We propose an ROV identification framework called TriNT that measures the path triplet difference between valid and invalid routing paths. The ROV identification results of the TriNT closely match the implementation of ROV as announced by the AS operators. Compared with previous methods, TriNT has a low network overhead, a short experimental cycle, and recognition of a wide range of ASes.

 Lattice-Based Universal Designated Multi-verifiers Signature Scheme  
  Abstract   
 In a universal designated multi-verifiers signature ( UDMVS  ) scheme, any signature holder, not necessarily the signer, can non-interactively prove to a set of specific verifiers the fact that the signature holder holds a valid signature from the signer, but the designated verifiers are unable to convince any third party of this fact. However, the existing UDMVS  schemes based on the large integer factorization problem and the discrete logarithm problem on finite field or elliptic curve are no longer secure in the post quantum era. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lattice-based UDMVS  scheme, which is resistant to quantum computing attacks, it also avoids the risk of online eavesdropping attacks on existing universal designated verifier signature schemes. Moreover, based on the small integer solution ( SIS  ) problem and the learning with errors ( LWE  ) problem, the proposed lattice-based UDMVS  scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model for the strong unforgeability, the non-transferability and the privacy of signer’s identity.

 Differential Cryptanalysis Against SIMECK Implementation in a Leakage Profiling Scenario  
  Abstract   
 Even though SIMECK as a lightweight block cipher can be secure against differential cryptanalysis, the practical security of SIMECK implementation against differential cryptanalysis is not clear. In light of this, the security of three versions of SIMECK implementation against differential cryptanalysis is considered in a leakage profiling scenario. In a leakage profiling scenario, the leakages of three versions of SIMECK implementation can be characterized and template attack can be used to recover the eighth round output. Then, eight-round differential cryptanalysis based on some three-round differentials can be performed to recover the secret key used by SIMECK implementation. We evaluate the efficiency of this combinatorial analysis style in simulated scenario where the values of different parameters that can influence the efficiency of template attack are under full control. The evaluation results show that about 340, 720 and 1040 correct pairs of samples can be enough to recover the secret key of three versions of SIMECK implementation with at most \(2^{21}\)  exhaustive search, and the success rate of key-recovery can be higher than 90%. Therefore, inner rounds of SIMECK implementation should also be protected to counteract side-channel attacks.

 Shrinkable Ring Signatures: It Wasn’t Them!  
  Abstract   
 Ring signatures facilitate a signer to arbitrarily form a set of ring members and produce a signature on their behalf without exposing his own identity. Once signed, the signature is fixed to these particular participants. However, what if, in the future, due to problems with other members, the signatory wants to exclude them from the initial ring, making the signature represent fewer members? For instance, an entrepreneur wishes to remove his arrested business partners from his previously signed ring signatures to stay out of trouble; he desires to prove that it wasn’t them who signed the signatures while keeping himself anonymous among the remaining ring members. Unfortunately, no existing variants of ring signatures can provide a feasible solution for this situation. To address this issue, we introduce a new notion of Shrinkable Ring Signature  (SRS), which allows a signatory to prove later that his already signed signature is actually on behalf of a smaller ring than the original one. We also formalize the syntax and security models for SRS. In terms of construction, we design a generic framework for an SRS from a Merkle-tree-based accumulator, a collision-resistant one-way function, a public key encryption scheme, a string commitment scheme, and a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system. We show that our scheme is anonymous, unforgeable and shrinkable under the random oracle model. With regards to efficiency, the size of the produced signature only grows logarithmically with the number of ring members. Additionally, we present a concrete instantiation from lattices whose security relies on the SIS and LWE assumptions.

 Related-Tweakey Boomerang and Rectangle Attacks on Reduced-Round Joltik-BC  
  Abstract   
 As one of the candidates for authenticated encryption in the second round of the CAESAR competition, Joltik has an internal lightweight tweakable block cipher Joltik-BC. In ASIACRYPT 2014, designers stated that the real threat to Joltik-BC comes from attacks that exploit the tweakey schedule, i.e. related-tweakey differential attacks. However, there has been no such attack against Joltik-BC currently. In the paper, we evaluate the resistance to Joltik-BC against boomerang attacks. Considering that not all distinguishers with high probability have a significant effect in key recovery attacks, we incorporate the complexity of key recovery into the search for distinguishers and turn to search for the entire truncated attack paths. Specifically, by considering truncated differential propagation, we control the number of active nibbles on the sides of plaintext and ciphertext to reduce key guessing. Then we apply it to search for appropriate distinguishers of Joltik-BC. Finally, we propose a 10-round related-tweakey boomerang attack for Joltik-BC-128 and a 14-round related-tweakey rectangle attack for Joltik-BC-192. To reduce the time complexity, we also utilize the property of components to guess partial key bits and deduce other key bits. This is the first work to evaluate the resistance of related-tweakey boomerang attack for Joltik-BC and both of them increase the round number of key recovery attacks.

 Isogeny-Based Password-Authenticated Key Exchange Based on Shuffle Algorithm  
  Abstract   
 At CRYPTO 2022, Abdalla et al. incorporate the ability to compute the quadratic twist of elliptic curves to extend the framework of group actions introduced by Alamati et al. (ASIACRYPT 2020), and proposed two password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols. Their first protocol \(\textsf{X}\)  - \(\textsf{GA}\)  - \(\textsf{PAKE}_\ell \)  is a provably secure one-round isogeny-based scheme with a password length of \(\ell \)  , which improves security by increasing computation and communication overhead. In \(\textsf{X}\)  - \(\textsf{GA}\)  - \(\textsf{PAKE}_\ell \)  , each party needs to choose \(2 \ell \)  elements and perform \(5 \ell \)  group actions. In this paper, we present an isogeny-based PAKE protocol that is more efficient than \(\textsf{X}\)  - \(\textsf{GA}\)  - \(\textsf{PAKE}_\ell \)  . In our scheme, we reduce the number of set elements to \(\ell \)  , thus the overhead of communication between users and servers is significantly decreased. By using the shuffle algorithm, the number of group actions that each party needs to perform is reduced to \(2\ell \)  , but our protocol can still prevent trivial attacks using twists. Due to the use of Merkle root and password in the shuffle function, the attackers cannot select a message from the received message. Also, the length of the message used for key derivation is reduced from \(3\ell \)  to \(\ell \)  . We prove the security based on the security assumption in the isogeny-based setting.

 A New Construction of Leakage-Resilient Identity-Based Encryption Scheme  
  Abstract   
 Although a large number of provably secure cryptographic primitives have been proposed in the literature, many of these schemes might be broken in practice because of various leakage attacks. Therefore, the leakage resilience property should be considered in designing these primitives. However, in identity-based cryptography, most of the existing leakage-resilient identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes suffer some limitations: they either resist the leakage attacks in the selective identity security model or achieve the chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security based on a non-static assumption. To further solve the above problems, in this paper, an IBE scheme with adaptive leakage-resilient chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) security is proposed, and its security is rigorously proved in the random oracle model under a classic static assumption, e.g., decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In addition, the leakage-resilient CCA security can be obtained from the above CPA secure IBE scheme. That is, a generic method created leakage-resilient CCA secure public-key encryption is proposed, and the leakage-resilient CCA secure IBE scheme can also be created. Therefore, we propose a noval method to create leakage-resilient IBE scheme with CCA security from static complexity assumption.

 Enhancing Portability in Deep Learning-Based Side-Channel Attacks Against Kyber  
  Abstract   
 Despite extensive research on side-channel attacks (SCAs) against lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs), there has been limited attention to the portability of existing deep-learning-based SCA distinguisher, especially concerning the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) KEM standard Kyber. Our work addresses the portability challenges that stem from the device and measurement variations in SCAs against Kyber. We focus on the plaintext checking oracle-based SCA against Kyber, a prominent method in the field. We propose the Ablated Multiple Leakage Point Model (Ablated-MLPM) approach to optimize deep learning models, enhancing intra-board (same device with different EM probe placement) and inter-board (different devices) portability while mitigating overfitting concerns. Our contributions include the first systematic analysis of portability issues in SCAs against Kyber, highlighting their negative impact on attack efficiency. Real-world implementations are conducted on an STM32F407G board with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, using code from the well-known open-source pqm4 library. The results demonstrate that our Ablated-MLPM approach achieves more than \(99\%\)  accuracy in all datasets, significantly enhancing both intra-board and inter-board portability. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight model, Ablated-MLPM-LW, reducing the training parameters by \(79.63\%\)  at the cost of requiring more queries.

 Generic CCA Secure Key Homomorphic KEM and Updatable Public Key Encryption  
  Abstract   
 Updatable Public Key Encryption (UPKE) is a technique for updating public and private keys in secure messaging protocols, which was initially introduced by Jost et al. (EUROCRYPTO ’19). Alwen et al. (CRYPTO ’20) later provided an IND-CPA secure UPKE. Asano et al., in turn, applied the FO transformation to UPKE outputs to achieve IND-CCA security. However, their approach doubles the time complexity, as they treat the IND-CPA UPKE as a black box that runs the encryption process once. In this paper, we formalize an IND-CCA model for key encapsulation mechanisms that involve a one-way homomorphic function which is named key homomorphism (KhKEM). If we construct a UPKE scheme from an IND-CCA KhKEM, a one-way secure pseudorandom generator, and an IND-CCA Encrypt-then-MAC symmetric encryption scheme, we demonstrate that this generic hybrid UPKE design will be IND-CCA secure. We finally consider three KhKEM instances and discuss the parameters and efficiency. We show that our scheme has better efficiency compared with Asano et al.’s scheme.

 Breaking GEA-Like Stream Ciphers with Lower Time Cost  
  Abstract   
 GEA-1 and GEA-2 are two proprietary stream ciphers used in GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) to protect GPRS from eavesdropping. GEA-2a is an improved version of GEA-2 proposed recently. In this paper, new weaknesses of GEA-like stream ciphers (i.e., GEA-1, GEA-2 and GEA-2a) are discovered and analyzed. As the technical contribution, an automatic algorithm is proposed to search for differential paths of full GEA-like stream ciphers. By this automatic algorithm, the differential paths of full GEA-1, GEA-2 and GEA-2a are found, whose probabilities are up to \(2^{-22.90}\)  , \(2^{-19.60}\)  and \(2^{-18.60}\)  respectively. Based on these found differential paths, practical distinguishing attacks and key recovery attacks on GEA-like stream ciphers in the chosen IV setting are presented. All these attacks have been confirmed by experimental results on a common PC. The cryptanalytic results show that the initializations of all GEA-like stream ciphers are far from being optimal and need to be strengthened.

 SNIPER: Detect Complex Attacks Accurately from Traffic  
  Abstract   
 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is widely acknowledged as a formidable cyberspace danger that may result in critical data leakage and huge losses. Some processes of APT attacks inevitably expose behavioral beacons in traffic, which makes it possible to detect APT attacks from traffic. Unlike deploying attack detectors at end devices or critical servers, anomaly detection at the network entrance provides a larger monitoring field but has to bear a huge traffic load. In addition, traditional approaches focus on specific protocols or scenarios, making dealing with complex and volatile APT attacks difficult. Thus, it is challenging to catch up with the ever-growing high-speed traffic and accurately identify complex attacks from it. In this paper, we present SNIPER, a highly efficient and accurate network-side APT detection system. SNIPER uses a multi-task model to capture more comprehensive characterization information about the traffic. This rich characterization information provides the basis for accurately identifying attack traffic. Then, to avoid the additional overhead of running a large multi-tasking model and to further improve detection speed, SNIPER distills the shared feature layer of the multi-tasking model into a lightweight model for final anomaly detection. With this design, SNIPER can identify much of the activity during an APT attack with extreme accuracy at a rate that matches enterprise traffic. Finally, we evaluate SNIPER on the DAPT dataset, and the result shows that SNIPER surpasses the baseline approach in all metrics, obtaining an F1 score of 0.99.

 From the Perspective of Prototypes: A Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Learning Framework  
  Abstract   
 Federated learning, as a collaborative learning approach that protects user privacy, has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. However, traditional federated learning paradigm generally suffers from two major limitations: ubiquitous reliance on the IID assumption and the homogeneous architecture design of local model and global model. In contrast, prototype federated learning, a personalize federated learning (PFL) paradigm, addresses these heterogeneity problem quite well. However, its original paradigm ignores privacy risks posed by prototype leakage. To prove the risk of prototype leakage, we propose a generative attack method based on conditional generative models, using prototype information to achieve sample reconstruction and theft of training results. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time that prototype information leakage can lead to a series of privacy security issues. Furthermore, We propose a privacy-preserving personalized federated learning framework based on prototypes, ingeniously integrating homomorphic encryption technology into the training of prototype federated learning through equivalent transformations, thus addressing the privacy issue in prototype federated learning.

 Efficient Large-Scale Multi-party Computation Based on Garbled Circuit  
  Abstract   
 Multi-party garbled circuits employ distributed garbling strategy to achieve constant-round secure computation and authentication techniques to resist malicious adversaries. Implementations of these multi-party authenticated garbled circuits are used in constructing payment channels in blockchain and decentralized oracles for TLS. However, the high communication and computation costs limit their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient, large-scale and constant-round multi-party computation protocol based on information-theoretic message authentication code and garbled circuit in the malicious model. Additionally, we propose a novel path-related optimization technique for multi-party authenticated garbled circuit, where parties generate a garbled circuit based on the related path in the circuit rather than the entire circuit. Through experimental evaluation and comparison with related work, the proposed scheme demonstrates dramatic improvement in computation and communication efficiency for each party when the number of parties increases.

 Parallel Implementation of Sieving Algorithm on Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Computing Architectures  
  Abstract   
 Sieving algorithms currently represent the fastest approach of solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP). However, current sieving algorithms exclusively utilize either CPUs or GPUs. This paper introduces a novel sieving approach tailored to CPU+GPU heterogeneous computing platforms. We constructed a runtime system capable of concurrently executing both CPU and GPU versions of the sieving algorithm. The GPU version of the sieving algorithm reduces the demand for graphics memory by efficiently transferring data in batches. We used two computing platforms to evaluate our method: Hannibal is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU; Zeus is equipped with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8176M CPU and two Integrated Matrox G200eW3 Graphics Controllers. The experimental results show that, compared to the classical sieving algorithm implementation in G6K, the proposed method achieves a minimum speedup of 7.2x (for 30-dimensional SVP) and a maximum of 588x (for 120-dimensional SVP) on Hannibal and a minimum speedup of 4.3x (for 30-dimensional SVP) and a maximum of 1230x (for 120-dimensional SVP) on Zeus.

 Unveiling the Efficacy of BERT’s Attention in Memory Obfuscated Malware Detection  
  Abstract   
 The study addresses the challenge of detecting obfuscated malware, particularly memory-obfuscated variants, which evade conventional detection methods by targeting a system’s volatile memory. By leveraging transformer-based models, notably BERT, the research demonstrates promising advancements in malware detection. Through data augmentation and rigorous feature selection processes, the study enhances the CIC-MlMem-2022 dataset, improving its quality for training classification models. Comparative analysis with conventional machine learning techniques highlights the superior performance of BERT and DistilBERT, achieving approximately 74% accuracy in classifying malware families. Notably, BERT exhibits exceptional capability in generalizing to unseen malware, achieving a remarkable 100% success rate in categorizing new families. These findings underscore the potential of transformer-based models for effectively detecting obfuscated malware, emphasizing the need for intelligent detection mechanisms in cybersecurity.

 An eID-Based Privacy-Enhanced Public Transportation Ticket System  
  Abstract   
 The electronic ticketing (e-ticketing) network system has been widely adopted in many countries, offering numerous benefits to public transport authorities and their customers. These benefits include fast and compatible verification processes and mechanisms for replacing lost tickets. Additionally, the system provides security against forgery through cryptographic mechanisms. Most e-ticketing systems use RFID technology to facilitate authentication. RFID-based authentication publishes customer-related sensitive information—e.g., customer location—as temporary data. RFID alone does not adequately address privacy concerns. In this work, we discuss the relevant privacy and security requirements of existing e-ticketing systems and introduce an eID protocol designed to create a privacy-enhanced framework.

 Outsourced and Robust Multi-party Computation with Identifying Malicious Behavior and Application to Machine Learning  
  Abstract   
 This work proposes an efficient n  -party computation framework with malicious security in the outsourced case. We consider a non-symmetrical trust setting that \(n-1\)  parties, including \(P_0\)  , is semi-honest and one party is malicious. Once the party in \(\{P_1,P_2,...,P_{n-1}\}\)  misbehaves, we will caught and exclude it, achieving robustness by executing the further computations among semi-honest parties. Unlike previous works that focused on traditional robustness, we do not need to delegate the computation to an identified honest party, which contradicts the usual expectation of privacy and hinder the adoption in practice. Our framework bridges the gap between semi-honest and malicious honest-majority multi-party protocols, and is well suited for privacy-preserving machine learning. In general, machine learning depends on large amounts of data and powerful computing power, leading resource-constrained clients to resort to secure outsourced computing (SOC) approach. In this work, we utilize the n  -party framework to design efficient building blocks for machine learning. We significantly improve the efficiency of blocks and implement machine learning inference in LAN and WAN setting, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our framework outperforms the existing honest-majority protocols, such as SWIFT (USENIX Security’21) in terms of “robustness” and Fantastic Four (USENIX Security’21) in terms of efficiency.

 Controlled Multi-client Functional Encryption for Flexible Access Control  
  Abstract   
 In Controlled Functional Encryption (C-FE), a policy parameter is introduced during encryption to restrict how the decryptor can decrypt and compute the ciphertext, but C-FE shows certain limitations in complex scenarios involving multiple encryptors participating with their data remaining confidential from each other. To overcome these limitations and leverage the advantages of Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), we extend C-FE, introducing a new primitive termed Controlled Multi-Client Functional Encryption for Flexible Access Control (CMCFE-FAC). This primitive introduces several key innovations: firstly, our CMCFE-FAC scheme combines MCFE to support multiple encryptors, enabling independent encryption and ensuring data privacy and security. Secondly, CMCFE-FAC combines attribute-based mechanisms to support dynamic access control, expanding traditional access control policies and enhancing their flexibility. Thirdly, we formalize the definition and security model for CMCFE-FAC, propose a CMCFE-FAC scheme tailored for the inner product function, and demonstrate the scheme’s security based on the DBDH assumption. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results are provided to illustrate its effectiveness and security.

 A Secure Incentive Mechanism in Blockchain-Based Mobile Crowdsensing  
  Abstract   
 With the widespread popularity of smart devices in recent years, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) as a new appealing data collection paradigm has gained attention in urban monitoring, traffic prediction and social networks, which deploys on decentral terminals for contribution from mobile devices of a large number of participants or crowdsensing nodes. However, traditional MCS systems are mainly based on integrated server development, which cannot fully guarantee their reliability in reality. In addition, the incentive phase of MCS is usually performed under clear-text conditions, it is easy to link the real identity of the nodes with the completed tasks. Therefore, nodes might be unwilling to participate in sensing tasks due to concerns about possible privacy leakage and lack of fair incentives. In addressing the issue of security in corwdsensing, in this work, we propose a privacy-preserving incentive mechanism in blockchain-based mobile crowdsensing systems. It applies blind signatures and zero-knowledge proofs to empower users to update their reputation and receive remuneration for contributing data without divulging the specifics of their individual contributions. In addressing the issue of equitable incentivization, we design an incentive mechanism that distributes rewards fairly based on their contributions, and provide a reputation quantification model to update participants’ reputations reasonably. Finally, we design a reputation-based consensus node selection mechanism to constrain the behavior of consensus node. The experimental results indicate that the reputation quantitative model were in line with our expectations.

 A Comparative Analysis of Phishing Tools: Features and Countermeasures  
  Abstract   
 Phishing is a form of social engineering attack in which targets are contacted by email by someone posing as a legitimate sender to lure the target into sending them sensitive information, such as login information, credit card details, or other personal information. There are a large number of methods to perform phishing attacks, with one of the most common being website-based phishing attacks. These are attacks in which targets are lured to a website that seems to be legitimate but is a fraudulent webpage that steals all the submitted information. There are several tools that can be used for these phishing attacks, e.g., Social Engineering Toolkit (SET), Zphisher, and GoPhish. These tools set up fake websites for phishing and collect login information from the targeted users who are fooled by the legitimate website. This paper presents the method for performing a phishing attack using these three tools and compares the application of these tools to launch phishing attacks and campaigns. We specifically select these three tools because they are free and provide a good platform to create or mimic legitimate websites and use this to launch phishing campaigns to get confidential information. The comparative assessment is performed based on criteria such as GUI, integration with Windows and Linux, report generation, multiple phishing campaign, extracting victim system and browser details. The evaluation shows that GoPhish satisfies most of the features and is widely used in industry for phishing campaigns and creating cyber awareness.

 OEIBS: A Secure Obfuscation for Encrypted Identity-Based Signatures Scheme in NB-IoT  
  Abstract   
 The Internet of Things (IoT) has become pervasive in various domains and offers unprecedented convenience to society. The Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology is particularly well-suited for deployment in applications such as smart manufacturing, smart homes, and smart cities. However, NB-IoT requires low power consumption and network security, which pose significant challenges. While several cryptographic schemes have been proposed for NB-IoT, most of them are infeasible due to the high computing power required by the nodes. In this paper, we propose a secure obfuscation for encrypted identity-based signatures in NB-IoT. Our approach leverages the high computational power of the IoT gateway to generate an encrypted signature, while ensuring the node’s private key cannot be extracted. We prove that our scheme satisfies the virtual black box (VBB) properties and is secure against attacks by semi-honest gateways. Furthermore, we implement our scheme using the Java pairing-based cryptography library (JPBC) on a laptop and a server, and our experimental results demonstrate the practicality of our scheme in IoT applications.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

  SUBMISSION TYPES AND PROCEDURES  
 NOTES AND BRIEFS  
 ISWC accepts contributions of original, unpublished research in two lengths. Papers are published and archived in the  ACM Digital Library   .   
 Notes   :   novel, rigorous research contributions of smaller scope than  full papers submissions to IMWUT   . Notes should reflect a more narrow research question, but not reflect early-stage (e.g. pilot, under-developed) research, or preliminary technological development without a robust evaluation. Notes should  not exceed 6 pages in the 2-column, ACM proceedings format  (please refer to the  Ubicomp/ISWC template and formatting   ). References do not count to the page limit (i.e. references can be on pages 7+), but it is important that the core paper including  all text and figures   is in the first 6 pages. Appendices are not allowed.   
 Briefs   :   novel research contributions of a narrow scope. Briefs should include system or technology development with limited evaluation.  Briefs should not exceed 3 pages in the 2-column, ACM proceedings forma  t (please refer to the  Ubicomp/ISWC template and formatting   ). References do not count to the page limit (i.e. references can be on pages 4+), but it is important that the core paper including  all text and figures   is in the first 3 pages. Appendices are not allowed.   
 Former “  Long Papers”   : Since ISWC and UbiComp have started co-hosting the conference, papers formerly known as “Long papers” must be submitted via the  IMWUT journal system   . IMWUT has 3 submission deadlines a year (1 February, 1 May, 1 November). When submitting to IMWUT,  please make sure you tick the “Wearable” checkbox   as it helps allocate the papers to suitable Associate Editors. More information about IMWUT submissions and their presentation is available  here   .   
 ISWC 2024 contributions will be invited to the UbiComp/ISWC 2024 conference in Melbourne, Australia, October 5-9, 2024.   
 TEMPLATE FOR THE SUBMISSION  
 Please refer to the  Ubicomp/ISWC template and formatting   .   
 SUBMISSION, REVIEWING AND CAMERA-READY PROCEDURES  
 All papers should be sent through the submission site available through the  Precision Conference System (PCS)   .   
 Double-blind TPC review   :   ISWC follows a double-blind review process. The submissions shall undergo exclusive evaluation by the ISWC Technical Program Committee (TPC), except in instances where, for special cases, external experts are designated by the members of the TPC. The  anonymization policy of ACM IMWUT   should be observed. Therefore,  submit your papers without identifying information  (i.e. it must be anonymized), including author names and pay attention when citing prior work to use a style which does not lend to easy identification of the authors (i.e. in third person). For instance, instead of “In our previous work we showed….” one could write “It was recently shown that … [ref]”.  Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized to allow reviewers to ensure that the existing literature has been adequately taken into account.  Any link to codes or visual materials (e.g., videos, images) needs to be anonymized too.   
 Accepted papers:   final edits (in alignment with reviewer comments) will be prepared by the authors for submission on the  Camera Ready Deadline   .   
 Shepherded papers   :   those are papers which require very specific changes identified by reviewers and the program committee members. They are considered to be conditionally accepted, subject to the authors modifying their paper to address specific shepherding comments. These may fall in two categories. Some papers may be requested to be revised in a shorter format (e.g. from Notes to Briefs), while others may be requested to be revised in the same format. A shepherd will guide the authors to ensure that the required changes are adequately completed. Revision timelines will be agreed between the shepherd and authors, but must be fully complete and approved by the shepherd by the  Shepherding Acceptance Deadline   and then readied for the  Camera Ready Deadline   .   
 Rejected papers   : Some rejected papers may be invited for submission as posters or demonstrations at the UbiComp/ISWC 2024 Conference.   
 Desk Rejects   :   Papers out of the scope of ISWC or without appropriate anonymization may be rejected without reviews.   
 All papers well suited for the format may also be invited for an additional submission as a demonstration at the UbiComp/ISWC 2024 conference.   
 REVIEWING CRITERIA  
 All papers are reviewed based on their scientific merit and contribution to the scientific progress in the domain of wearable technology. Submissions should demonstrate novelty (contribution above the state of the art); impact (contribution that furthers the state of the art in meaningful and significant ways, that can be translated and applied to new contexts); and rigor (contribution that is thoroughly supported with well-constructed evidence).   
 For authors to get a sense of what the ISWC community likes to see in papers we may suggest consulting the  2023 ISWC Author Guide   .

 Past Conferences   
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing ( UbiComp  ) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.   
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing ( ISWC  ) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.   
 A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

 Welcome to ITC 2024!   
   
 Dear Colleague,  
 We are holding the conference in beautiful San Diego, CA. We have a fantastic program that addresses new test technology challenges that significantly affect today’s electronic products!  
 ITC is the world’s premier conference dedicated to electronics test. This year’s ITC continues with its mission to play a unique role as an information sharing forum,  where the wide range of its offerings allows ITC participants to learn, network and conduct business. This year’s program includes a top-notch technical program, vibrant exhibitors, information-packed tutorials  , interactive technical panels  , three workshops  , as well as the all-important networking that these events can provide. The technical program has been designed to optimize personal interactions on all levels.  
 AI is everywhere, especially at ITC! Our Tuesday keynote and visionary talks are great examples where industry leaders will discuss AI. We also have an AI track comprising 4 papers sessions where speakers will address machine learning and AI in test. Our supporter presentations also will address test in the age of AI, as will two of our tutorials.  
 This year’s program will include papers from a pool of impressive submissions and solicited papers. Of these submissions, a large number will focus on AI, automotive, memory, and hardware security. In complement to the paper presentations, there will be special sessions on hardware security certification, chiplet integration, silicon lifecycle management, computing in memory, as well as design and test of high-power compound devices and quantum electronics.  
 We are continuing and expanding on the inclusion of the Industrial Practice papers sessions as ITC has a very strong focus on industry practice as well as industry and academia advances.  
 ITC 2024 features a vibrant exhibition  showcasing relevant companies. The exhibition will serve as a convenient one-stop-shop for all the elements of test technology.  
 This year’s live event will enable us to embrace all of the features of the conference such as personal interaction and networking. The ITC Grand Reception will be held Tuesday evening.  
 Last, but not least, I would like to recognize the enormous efforts of the multitude of dedicated volunteers who made ITC possible by donating their time, expertise, and enthusiasm. Without their hard work and dedication, ITC would not be possible. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to join our exciting team in the future.  
 ITC is the premier event for networking, where professionals from all over the world converge to sharpen skills, exchange ideas and do business. Join us, throughout the conference, for networking activities and to unwind.

Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science 2025  
 The 16th Annual Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference will be held at Columbia University in New York City on January 7 - January 10 2025.  
 Registration  
 Please register at the eventbrite registration page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/itcs-conference-2025-registration-1080490659649  Registration is open until December 31  , and we ask that you register as soon as possible. If you don't register by this deadline, you may not be given access to campus in time for the conference.  
 The registration fee is $250 for students and postdocs, and $350 otherwise. Students and postdocs who need assistance can write to the local organizers (email at the bottom of this page) to request a waiver. If you'd like to apply for a waiver, please do so before December 15th.  
 When you register, the first time you are asked to give your name, please give the name as it appears on your government ID. You may need to show this ID to access Columbia campus. After the payment step of registration, there is a final page where you will be asked for the name you want to appear on your badge, which may be different.  
 Hotels  
 We generally recommend staying at a hotel in the Upper West Side neighrbood of Manhattan, from which one can easily get to Columbia campus using the 1 train subway line. The station at 116 St is right next to the campus entrance gate.  
 We have reserved a block of rooms at a discounted rate at the Hotel Belleclaire which can be booked here  . There is a limited number of rooms available, so please be sure to book soon.  
 Conference Venue  
 The talks and all other events will be held in the Columbia Computer Science Building, which can be accessed from the 4th floor of the Mudd Building.

 Getting to Columbia and around New York  
 Columbia and the Upper West Side are accessible by public transportation from all the NY-NJ airports (LGA, JFK & EWR). The best way to get around the city is to use New York subways and buses, although taxis, Ubers and Lyfts are also easily available from all three airports. LGA airport is the closest of the three airports to Columbia, and the M60 bus goes directly from all the terminals at LGA airport to Columbia campus. We recommend using the Google Maps app to determine how to use public transit to get to around the city, as the system is quite large and often complicated.

  Governance 

  The 16th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)  conference will take place at Columbia University. It will be held in person  from January 7 - January 10, 2025. .  
 ITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message will advance and inspire the greater theory community. The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.

 Submission Instructions  
  Authors should register and submit their paper via hotcrp submission site  , by the above strict  deadlines. The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements. Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.  
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.  In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.) The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc.  
 Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims. In addition, it is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.  
 Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and the discussion remain confidential from the authors.  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
  
 Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions  
  Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.  
 Online posting  
  Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arxiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.  
 Accepted papers  
  All the talks are expected to be in person. The talks in the conference will not be recorded, and instead the authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.  
 Graduating bits  
  Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the "Graduating bits" session. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and not to be missed! Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.  
 Awards  
  The committee may award a "best student paper" award.  
 Code of Conduct  
  ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment, including unwelcome advances or propositions of an intimate nature, particularly when coming from a more senior researcher to a less senior one. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates ( http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/  )  
 Proceedings  
  The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference. To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive.

 The International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) in 2025 will take place at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Campus Trondheim, Norway. The 36th event of this series features the topic Sustainable Digital Infrastructures. It is sponsored by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. During the event we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the conference series, which took place in Copenhagen in 1955 for the first time. The evolution of communications, networking and digital infrastructures is driving the digitalization of our society. The immense energy consumption of digital infrastructures and broader implications on the environment trigger the need to embed the sustainability paradigm into the technological development. Sustainable evolution of these technologies is triggered by the influence of computer science and telecommunication, the massive deployment of mobile communications and optics, the success of collaborative networking and social networks, the ever-increasing speed and flexibility of new communication technologies, networks, user devices, and applications, and the ever-changing operational challenges arising from these developments. ITC 36 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. The objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and sustainable IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE, and resilience. ITC 36 covers topics in the areas of: Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization Computer and communication networks, protocols and algorithms Wireless, mobile, ad-hoc and sensor networks, IoT applications Virtualization, data centers, distributed and cloud computing Mobile and personal computing systems Energy-efficient computing systems Real-time and fault-tolerant systems Social networks, multimedia systems, service-oriented architectures and Web services Smart power grids and other cyber-physical systems Emerging technologies Analytical modeling techniques and model validation Workload characterization and benchmarking Performance, scalability, power and reliability analysis Sustainability analysis and power management System measurement, performance monitoring and forecasting Anomaly detection, problem diagnosis and trouble-shooting Capacity planning, resource allocation, run time management and scheduling Quality of service, total cost of ownership and pricing Network Measurements, Big Data and AI Big data analytics and machine learning for network & traffic measurements analysis Application of Big Data frameworks (streaming, batch) to network data Novel or better algorithms for topology discovery, network tomography, etc. Measurement-driven network simulation methodologies Performance models from network measurements Network performance measurements and analysis Traffic & workload modeling, traffic generation techniques User characterization and modeling Quality-of-Service and Quality-of-Experience Application layer measurement methodologies and characterization Traffic classification, evasion and deanonymization Network anomaly detection and diagnosis Measurements for network security and forensics Measurements for privacy quantification, and privacy-preserving measurements Deep learning and foundation models Networking Architectures and Paradigms Software Defined Networking Network Function Virtualization Information and Content-centric networks Named data networking Energy efficiency Network security Programmable data planes Applications of SDN and NFV Network virtualization Wireless and Cellular Networks 5G communications and architectures and beyond Internet of Things Age of information Dynamic spectrum access/cognitive radio Game-theoretic/economic models Green (energy-efficient) wireless communications IEEE802.11x Mesh networks Mobile ad-hoc networks Mobile computing services Radio resource allocation/management Spectrum auctions/management Self-organizing networks Small and ultra-dense cells Scheduling mechanisms Software defined wireless networks Traffic model, characterization and measurements Vehicular communications Wireless multiaccess and communication Wireless sensors  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-11-28

 Welcome  
 It is our privilege to welcome you to the International Test Conference (ITC) sponsored by IEEE and the IEEE Philadelphia Section. ITC is the world’s premier conference dedicated to electronics test. Our volunteer committees worked very hard to provide to you an exciting event with a balance of the latest research, practical applications, and networking opportunities.  
 Our topics include many disciplines related to research and industrial practices related to electronics test and related areas.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The Best Paper Award has been renamed, the ITC  Ned Kornfield Best Paper Award in honor of Dr. Nathanial “Ned” Kornfield, ITC’s founder and longtime Chairman Emeritus.  
 To encourage excellence in its technical program, ITC  presents awards to authors of outstanding papers presented at ITC  and published in the proceedings. In determining award-winning papers, the ITC  Awards Selection Committee considers the quality of the papers as published in the Proceedings and as presented at the conference technical sessions. The committee’s decisions are based on responses by conference attendees as recorded on session rating cards and on the observations and recommendations of the ITC  Program Committee.  
 Visit the Awards Page  for a list of past ITC  Ned Kornfield Best Paper Award winners.

 STEERING COMMITTEE    PROGRAM COMMITTEE      
 International Test Conference, the cornerstone of TestWeek™ events, is the world’s premier conference dedicated to the electronic test of devices, boards and systems-covering the complete cycle from design verification, test, diagnosis, failure analysis and back to process and design improvement. At ITC  , test and design professionals can confront the challenges the industry faces, and learn how these challenges are being addressed by the combined efforts of academia, design tool and equipment suppliers, designers, and test engineers.  
 ITC  : A Forum for Exchange… The Harbinger of Change  
 In 1970, engineers facing the test challenges posed by the then-novel semiconductor memory device organized a symposium on IC testing. That meeting at the Rickshaw Inn in Cherry Hill, NJ drew a crowd of 147 people. That symposium is now a week-long conference attended by more than 2,000 engineers from around the world including sister ITC conferences in India and Asia.  
 In its fifty year history, International Test Conference has become the world’s leading electronics test conference . No other industry has changed as much – or changed the world as much – in those fifty years as semiconductor technology. ITC  has kept pace, always seeking to develop new and innovative ways to fulfill its primary objective: the exchange of technical information.
