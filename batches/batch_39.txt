  Committee 
  Visiting Iceland 

 Welcome to IDC2025 in Iceland!  
   
 We are pleased to announce the 24th annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) Conference, scheduled to occur from June 23-26, 2025 at University of Iceland in Reykjavík. IDC is the premier international conference for researchers, educators and practitioners to share the latest research findings, innovative methodologies and new technologies in the areas of inclusive child-centered design, learning and interaction.  
 The theme for IDC 2025 is hope  – IDC2025 aims to join together different generations to dream about and act upon a better future for us all. Even if the world around us can be worrisome, and children can feel sad and helpless due to on-going discussions on wars, health problems, and political struggles, adults should try to find ways for supporting children to remain brave, hopeful, and kind towards all, also towards those who are different from us. IDC2025 envisions a life full of bravery, kindness, and hope.

 Now  Welcome to  MedInfo2025  
 I am honored to invite you to the 20th World Congress on Medical and Health Informatics: MedInfo 2025. This event will be proudly hosted by the Taiwan Association for Medical Informatics (TAMI) on behalf of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). The conference will be held from August 9 to 13, 2025, at the Taipei International Convention Center (TICC) in Taipei, Taiwan.  
 This prestigious international event brings together thousands of digital health leaders and practitioners at the forefront of healthcare and is considered a landmark event on the global calendar. MedInfo 2025 is expected to attract thousands of delegates from around the world, with hundreds of speakers, as well as exhibitors, workshops, and masterclasses.  
 Our event theme – “HealthcareSmart × MedicineDeep” – aims to inspire us to lead the conversation and implement actions toward building a health sector that is accessible, where data is not horded, and where both clinicians and consumers are digitally enabled to work together in true partnership toward healthier lives.  
   
 This year’s conference takes place in Taiwan, a global center for AI innovation and chip manufacturing, home to industry leaders such as TSMC. Taiwan is also the birthplace of some of the most influential figures in technology, including Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, and Lisa Su, CEO of AMD. Their contributions to AI and technology are pivotal, especially in the application of these advancements within the healthcare sector. Hence, by hosting MedInfo 2025 in Taiwan, we aim to provide deeper insights into how AI technologies are driving transformation in healthcare, and offer a unique opportunity to engage with leading experts in AI and health informatics.  
 With both national and international audiences brought together, this is your opportunity to network, share, and highlight the latest achievements, advancements, research, and innovation in digital health and health informatics.  
 I eagerly anticipate welcoming you to Taiwan, the global hub of AI innovation, for #MedInfo25.  

 Our Story  Introducing  MedInfo2025  
 The International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and one of its Member Societies host the internationally acclaimed Medical and Health Informatics congress, known as MedInfo.  
 The event was established in 1974 and was held every three years until 2013. Since then, MedInfo has been held every two years. A vote at the IMIA General Assembly determines which IMIA Member Society will host the event.  
 MedInfo enables a high-quality scientific exchange of current research and critical thinking in health and biomedical informatics across the globe. The event also provides the national and international community with an opportunity for formal meetings and social networking.

 Interactive Entertainment Is Not Just a Trend In 2025 – It’s the Future of Event Entertainment  

 When planning an unforgettable event, it’s no longer enough to rely solely on traditional forms of entertainment. Guests crave experiences that engage them, draw them in, and make them feel like part of the show. This is why interactive entertainment is emerging as the future of event entertainment in 2025. From weddings to corporate gatherings and festivals, interactive acts are taking the guest experience to the next level—and Kinshira Entertainment is leading the way with one-of-a-kind, immersive offerings.  
 What is Interactive Entertainment?  
 Interactive entertainment blends performance art with guest engagement, creating unforgettable moments that are both immersive and personalized. Instead of sitting back and watching, guests become part of the magic. This can mean sharing a laugh with a stilt walker towering above the crowd, toasting with a glass of champagne served by a performer in an elegant strolling champagne dress, or being captivated by a living champagne wall. These experiences create deeper connections, meaningful memories, and perfect photo opportunities for social sharing.  
     
 Why Interactive Entertainment is Perfect for Any Event  
 Whether you’re planning a wedding, gala, corporate function, or festival, interactive performances elevate your event from ordinary to extraordinary. Here are a few reasons why interactive entertainment has become a must-have for modern celebrations:  
 It’s Instagram-Worthy: | Interactive acts like aerial champagne pouring or stilt walkers mingling with guests create visually stunning moments that guests will want to capture and share. 
  It Engages Guests of All Ages: | Performers bring the fun directly to your audience, ensuring everyone feels included, entertained, and engaged. 
  It Fits Any Theme: | From vintage circus to elegant black-tie affairs, Kinshira’s performances can be tailored to match your theme, ensuring your event feels cohesive and unforgettable. 
  Kinshira’s Interactive Entertainment Options

 Stilt Walkers: | Elegant, towering performers who greet and interact with guests. Create a photo moment with every guest at the event! 
  Strolling Champagne Dresses: | Sophisticated, wearable art serving bubbly in style. 
  Living Champagne Walls: | A luxurious twist to drink service, ring the bell and the wall comes to life serving a gladd of bubbly though the beautifully designed wall. 
  Aerial Champagne Pouring: | High-flying aerialists descending gracefully to pour drinks, creating a jaw-dropping moment your guests will never forget. 
  Roving Circus Acts: | Acrobats, jugglers, and costumed performers bringing excitement and energy as they roam through your event.

 About IDEAS 2024    

 The aim of the IDEAS-II series of symposiums is to address the engineered and application  aspects of data regardless of the database models.  
 The symposium provides an international forum for discussion of the problems of engineering data drivend systems involving not only database technology but the related areas of artfical inteligence, communication, information retrieval, human machine interface, multimedia, NLP, privacy, security and others. The goal of IDEAS is to foster closer interaction among the industrial, research and user communities and provides an excellent opportunity for them to meet, discuss ideas, examine the current ones and develop new solutions and research directions. Along with the technical sessions, the symposium also features prominent invited speakers.  
 IDEAS series of symposiums are scheduled annually and have been held since 1997 in North America, Europe and Asia. It has attracted participants from governmental and non-governmental agencies, industries, and academia to exchange ideas and share experiences.  
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer.

 Paper Submissions     
   
 The organizers of IDEAS 2024 invite original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Both short and long paper submissions are accepted.  
 LONG papers can be:  
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data; 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:  
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition; 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 

 Submission Guidelines and Instructions     
   
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 14 LNCS style pages; 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages. 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the EasyChair  online submission system.  
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

Following the recent successful events: IDEAL2023 in Évora, IDEAL2022 in Manchester (hybrid), IDEAL2021 (virtual), IDEAL2020 in Guimarães (virtual), IDEAL2019 in Manchester, and IDEAL 2018 in Madrid, the 25th edition, IDEAL2024 will be taking place in Valencia (European Green Capital), Spain.  
 Topics  
 IDEAL 2024 core themes or topics include, but not limited to:  
 Big Data Analytics 
  Machine Learning & Deep Learning 
  Data Mining 
  Information Retrieval and Management 
  Bio and Neuro-Informatics 
  Bio-Inspired Models 
  Agents and Hybrid Intelligent Systems 
  Real-world Applications of Intelligent Techniques 
  Instructions for authors  
 Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts (in pdf format) written in English by the deadline via the conference online submission system (see conference website). All submissions will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality and clarity. All contributions must be original, must not have been published elsewhere, and must not have been submitted elsewhere during the review period. Papers must not exceed 12 pages (including references) and must comply with the format of Springer LNCS/LNAI Proceedings (see www.springer.com/lncs   ).   
 Short papers  
 To encourage emerging results and novel initial developments, especially from PhD students and young researchers, we accept short papers (within 6 LNCS pages, including references)  . Such papers will also go through our rigorous peer-review process for their novelty and soundness with a quicker turn-around time. Although short papers are mainly for the main track, they can be submitted to any relevant Special Session too (information will be available). The submission system will treat any paper within 6 pages as short papers and PC chairs will ensure a speedy review of them  .

 “I wanted to reach out and let you know that Alvin and his team did an exceptional job on Wednesday. They were on time (a few even early) and everything looked amazing. Alvin was a pleasure to work with. It’s clear that the team are great at what they do, have strong camaraderie, and get the job done correctly and on time. You may have heard we had a few other vendors on site fulfilling the same types of services and your team was the clear standout. That only makes it easier for me to push for your services in the future. I will definitely reach out the next time I have a client interested in any of the types of games and services you offer.  
 I hope to work with you, Alvin and the rest of the IEG team again soon.”

 “I wanted to give a special thanks to Alvin, as he let me know that he is not usually onsite, except outside events. He did an excellent job leading and coordinating, he was on time, and I think he enjoyed himself as well! And it was pleasure to meet him.  
 I also wanted to give a special thanks to Mateo and Nicolas! Wow, they were very organized with managing the mechanical bull while people lined up to ride. They gave guests a thrill, they were interactive, they were nice and smiling, they worked with other vendors when they needed assistance, and even assisted guests who needed help getting onto the bull. Their presence was much appreciated! Next event, we recommend those two attendants, for sure.  
 Again, we appreciate Interactive Entertainment Group and hope you all have a successful rest of the year!”

 “I just wanted to send a big THANK YOU for the event you just did with us with your VR Flip on June 25th. It was the absolute hit of the event and was so well received.  
 On another more important note I can not say enough great things about Nicolas. I have never worked with someone so professional, so lovely, that works that hard and I will hands down request him for any event we do in the future with you. There were some challenges with load in but he worked so well in finding solutions and making it work. He is quite frankly a great person and is such a good ambassador for your company. He made the experience so much better and far exceeded my expectations. He is cc’d on this email so Nicolas THANK YOU for everything that weekend and we can’t wait to work with you again. This event was one of the biggest the hotel has had in its history and I’m so happy that you were a part of our extended team for this!  
 It’s always a bit nerve wracking working with a company you have not had history with and spending so much money on a product you have never tried BUT this was far beyond what we imagined. What you do is so unique, you provide quality and exciting offerings, professional services and we will 100% use you in the future. We have a few large US/Canadian events that I will be reaching soon to book a few things and I will be sending out several emails to our clients and other industry partners to recommend Interactive Entertainment Group.  
 Thank you again for giving us Nicolas and for adding such value and excitement to our event. I also want to give a big thanks to Kate, Marty and Alvin as well for assisting along the way and making me feel so comfortable.  
 We really look forward to working with you again in the future.”

 Quantitative Estimation of Reputation Risk  
  We present a quantitative definition of reputation risk, formulated in terms of a reputation time series comprising daily sentiment measurements. Self Supported Learning is used to quantify reputation risk by progressively refining an initial proposal for a Minimum Acceptable Sentiment, calculated from descriptive statistics of the reputation data. The derived values are validated using a “sense test” based on a Loess quantile. The results show that the Minimum Acceptable Sentiment value is given approximately by a two standard deviation lower tail of the observed data.

 Dissecting Data Practices in Android Apps: A Comparative Study of Data Collection and Sharing Behaviors  
  The exponential growth of mobile apps within the Android ecosystem has underscored the critical need for robust user privacy and data protection measures. Central to these concerns are the privacy policies that serve as the primary channel of communication between organizations and users, detailing data collection, utilization, and sharing practices. However, the efficacy of these policies is often undermined by their inaccessibility and the legalese that obfuscates their intent, presenting a barrier to informed user consent. This study addresses these challenges by harnessing the capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI) to perform a detailed analysis of data practices in Android apps. Our methodology extends beyond the traditional scope of AI-assisted analysis by not only identifying third-party entities but also by elucidating their data handling purposes. We introduce a classification system that distinguishes between ‘Regular’ and ‘Irregular’ app behaviors, offering a benchmark for app evaluation and compliance assessment. Our comparative analysis across various apps reveals patterns and anomalies in data management, providing actionable insights for developers, regulators, and users.

 Model-Based Meta-reinforcement Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization  
  Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of machine learning models. However, as the size and complexity of (deep) neural architectures continue to increase, conducting HPO has become very expensive in terms of time and computational resources. Existing methods that automate this process still demand numerous evaluations to find the optimal hyperparameter configurations. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on model-based reinforcement learning to effectively improve sample efficiency while minimizing resource consumption. We formulate the HPO task as a Markov decision process and develop a predictive dynamics model for efficient policy optimization. Additionally, we employ the Deep Sets framework to encode the state space, which is then leveraged in meta-learning for transfer of knowledge across multiple datasets, enabling the model to quickly adapt to new datasets. Empirical studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms alternative techniques on publicly available datasets in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy.

 Towards Sustainable Precision: Machine Learning for Laser Micromachining Optimization  
  In the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, ultra-short pulse laser micromachining stands out as a promising solution while also offering high-precision and qualitative laser processing. However, unlocking the full potential of ultra-short pulse lasers requires an optimized monitoring system capable of early detection of defective workpieces, regardless of the preprocessing technique employed. While advances in machine learning can help predict process quality features, the complexity of monitoring data necessitates reducing both model size and data dimensionality to enable real-time analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to enhance surface quality assessment across diverse preprocessing techniques. To facilitate real-time laser processing monitoring, our solution aims to optimize the computational requirements of the machine learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only outperforms the generalizability achieved by previous works across diverse preprocessing techniques but also significantly reduces the computational requirements for training. Through these advancements, we aim to establish the baseline for a more sustainable manufacturing process.

 Association Rules Mining with Auto-encoders  
  Association rule mining is one of the most studied research fields of data mining, with applications ranging from grocery basket problems to explainable classification systems. Classical association rule mining algorithms have several limitations, especially with regards to their high execution times and number of rules produced. Over the past decade, neural network solutions have been used to solve various optimization problems, such as classification, regression or clustering. However there is still no efficient way to mine association rules using neural networks. In this paper, we present an auto-encoder solution to mine association rule called ARM-AE. We compare our algorithm to FP-Growth and NSGAII on three categorical datasets, and show that our algorithm discovers high support and confidence rule set and has a better execution time than classical methods while preserving the quality of the rule set produced.

 Using Contrastive Learning to Map Stylistic Similarities in Narrative Writers  
  Exploring how literary authors influence each other and how intertextual connections can be found among them is a complex problem that is handled manually by experts. This research field, intertextuality, seeks to understand how writers relate to each other and how the works of one writer have reflected on the work of another. This analysis usually provides insight into the historical, cultural, biographical, and literary contexts that shape literary works. From a computational point of view, the approaches related to this problem have mainly dealt with problems of style classification, known as authorship attribution, but none have so far dealt with the problem of intertextuality. This paper proposes a novel approach based on contrastive learning to generate authorship embeddings that encapsulate the stylistic signatures of narrative writers and that can be projected into graphical representations to discern similarities between a dataset of literary writers. The embeddings generated with this approach aim to represent authorship styles are created and evaluated using a dataset of books from Project Gutemberg. During the evaluation, we perform a book and chunk-level evaluation, showing good performance in both cases. Finally, we present different graphical representations and provide a deep analysis of the relations that arise between the writers.

 Automatic Classification of Signal and Noise in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans Using Convolutional Neural Networks  
  The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning models like VGG16 and ResNet50, in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has significantly advanced our understanding of brain functionality and the diagnosis of neurological disorders. This paper explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fMRI data analysis, addressing challenges such as high dimensionality, noise, and the need for complex data preprocessing. Our study evaluates the performance of VGG16 and ResNet50 models and one 3D CNN on 2D and 3D fMRI datasets, highlighting the limitations of VGG16 in handling 2D data and demonstrating the superior performance of ResNet50 on balanced and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, we investigate the impact of using 3D data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), achieving up to 98% accuracy on the validation set. The results indicate that CNNs can effectively replace traditional Independent Component Analysis (ICA) methods by leveraging their capability for automatic feature extraction and end-to-end learning.

 How Resilient are Language Models to Text Perturbations?  
  Large language models typically rely on highly curated datasets that lack common irregularities such as typos and contractions, resulting in a mismatch between their training environments and real-world applications. This study evaluates the resilience of four prominent models in five different NLP tasks when confronted with perturbed inputs. We investigate three categories of perturbations: character-level, word-level and miscellaneous perturbations. By comparing performance on original and altered datasets, our results reveal a significant sensitivity to input perturbations across all models, with varying degrees of vulnerability depending on both the specific task and the type of perturbation. In particular, the XLNet model consistently shows superior robustness, while tasks involving grammatical coherence are most adversely affected.

 Emotional Sequential Influence Modeling on False Information  
  The extensive dissemination of false information in social networks affects netizen’s social lives, morals, and behaviours. When a neighbour expresses strong emotions (e.g., fear, anger, excitement) based on a false statement, these emotions can be transmitted to others, especially through interactions on social media. Therefore, exploring the mechanism that explains how an individual’s emotions change under the influence of a neighbour’s false statement is a practically important task. In this work, we systematically examining the public’s personal, interpersonal, and historical emotional influence based on social context, content, and emotional-based features. The contribution of this paper is to build an emotionally infused model called the Emotional-based User Sequential Influence Model+(E-USIM+) to understand users’ temporal emotional propagation patterns and predict future emotions against false information.

 CSSDH: An Ontology for Social Determinants of Health to Operational Continuity of Care Data Interoperability  
  The rise of digital platforms has led to an increasing reliance on technology-driven, home-based healthcare solutions, enabling individuals to monitor their health and share information with healthcare professionals as needed. However, creating an efficient care plan management system requires more than just analyzing hospital summaries and Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Factors such as individual user needs and social determinants of health, including living conditions and the flow of healthcare information between different settings, must also be considered. Challenges in this complex healthcare network involve schema diversity (in EHRs, personal health records, etc.) and terminology diversity (e.g., ICD, SNOMED-CT) across ancillary healthcare operations. Establishing interoperability among various systems and applications is crucial, with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) emphasizing the need for patient-centric access and control of healthcare data. In this paper, we propose an integrated ontological model, the Common Semantic Data Model for Social Determinants of Health (CSSDH), by combining ISO/DIS 13940:2024 ContSys with WHO Social Determinants of Health. CSSDH aims to achieve interoperability within the Continuity of Care Network.

 Padel Two-Dimensional Tracking Extraction from Monocular Video Recordings  
  This study introduces a novel framework for the automatic two-dimensional tracking of padel games using monocular recordings. By integrating advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques, our algorithm detects and tracks players, the court, and the ball. Through homography, we accurately project detected player positions onto a two-dimensional court, enabling comprehensive tracking throughout the game. We tested the proposed algorithm using amateur video recordings of padel games found in literature. This approach remains user-friendly, cost-effective, and adaptable to various camera angles and lighting conditions. This makes it accessible to both amateur and professional players and coaches, providing a valuable tool for performance analysis. Additionally, the proposed framework holds potential for adaptation to other sports with minimal modifications, further broadening its applicability.

 Drowsiness Detection Using Vital Sign Sensors and Deep Learning on Smartwatches  
  Drowsy drivers contribute to high rates of road accidents, leading to numerous fatalities and injuries. The dangers of drowsiness extend beyond the roads, affecting workplaces that require continuous attention and focus. This work aims to develop a non-intrusive, real-time system capable of assessing the user’s drowsiness level by processing physiological signals collected by smartwatch sensors. The study utilized photoplethysmography (PPG) and heart rate data from a smartwatch, labeled with an adapted Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Deep Learning techniques were used to fine-tune hyperparameters and train a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network to reach better prediction performance on drowsiness data. Besides, a 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate performance and create an ensemble, enhancing prediction robustness through election method. The results show significant prediction accuracy using the ensemble on test data (91.41%). The final pre-trained model was integrated into the smartwatch, creating a real-time drowsiness detection system. This system alerts the user through sound and vibration feedback, preventing them from falling asleep and reducing the risk of accidents.

 Benchmarking Out of the Box Open-Source LLMs for Malware Detection Based on API Calls Sequences  
  The rise of generative AI has created several scenarios where older technologies (or human intervention) can be replaced by an agent that relies on LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate if an LLM is suited for malware detection and in what scenarios. For this task, we compare 4 open source models [LLama2-13B, Mistral, Mixtral and Mixtral-FP16] using a set of 20000 malware and 20000 benign files for which we provide behavioral information as a list of API calls sequences. The goal is to identify scenarios where these types of models can be successfully used for malware detection.

 Multimodal Visio-Lingual Content Analysis to Detect Fake Content on Reddit  
  The spread of misinformation across online social networks poses a significant threat to political stability, societal harmony, and economic integrity. This paper tackles the challenge of analyzing online posts, which often consist of diverse heterogeneous modalities like text or image. We introduce a multimodal architecture designed to accurately identify manipulated content. Our approach leverages a large-scale, multimodal dataset encompassing images, captions, comments, and metadata for each post. A novel encoding strategy is employed to capture both the semantic content and hierarchical structure of the comments. Based on CLIP, an early fusion technique is applied to process and merge the hidden representations. This method effectively combines multimodal and unimodal data according to their respective information channels. The performance is evaluated against the Fakeddit dataset, achieving a competent accuracy in binary classification tasks (0.9506 acctest) with significant hardware limitations, and outperforming the SotA in more complex categorization tasks, with 0.9509 acctest and 0.9371 acctest in 3-way and 6-way label classification, respectively.

 MetaLIRS: Meta-learning for Imputation and Regression Selection  
  Missing data is a prevalent problem in data science for many fields such as natural, social, and health sciences. Since most regression methods can not handle missing data directly, imputation methods are used in data pre-processing. Finding the best imputation method is non-trivial, however. Moreover, our results show that an independent choice for a best imputation method does not always result in the best predictive performance in the end; the combination matters. Furthermore, search-based approaches for finding a best-fitting imputer/regressor-pair can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose the MetaLIRS (Meta Learning Imputation and Regression Selection) framework for developing resource-friendly ML-based recommendation models for method selection. With MetaLIRS, we constructed a proof-of-concept recommendation model based on 12 meta-features that achieves an accuracy of 63% for selecting the best-fitting imputer/regressor-pair. A data scientist can use this model for a quick resource-friendly recommendation on which imputation and regression method to use for their particular data set and task without the need for an expensive grid search among methods.

 Pipeline for Semantic Segmentation of Large Railway Point Clouds  
  This paper presents a novel deep-learning pipeline to segment large railway datasets with minimal manual annotation, notoriously time consuming. The pipeline adapts DINOv2 [11] for labeling point clouds, with tailored self-distillation pre-training and fine-tuning. The adopted transformer architecture successfully generalizes to multiple railway datasets, with a lightweight pipeline that outperforms manual labeling speed by a factor of 6, despite requiring a final segmentation check and correction. This groundbreaking achievement bridges the gap between the need for annotated point clouds in railway industry and the lack of publicly available annotated datasets.

 Preliminary Investigation on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Change of Direction Classification in Running  
  The ability to detect, define, and classify Change of Direction (COD) movements during running plays a crucial role in sports science, as it has been widely used to assess athlete performance. Automating the process of COD classification during live games or training can provide real-time feedback. In this study, we evaluated Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for the classification of COD using accelerometers and gyroscope sensor data, and speed data were calculated from the Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor data. We hypothesized that DL algorithms classify COD better than ML classification algorithms. Comparative analysis showed that the best-performing DL and ML models showed similar behavior. Similarly, the statistical analysis observed no significant difference. This emphasized the importance of accurate model selection.

 Efficient Radar Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithms and Stochastic Heuristic Initialization  
  Optimal radar scheduling is essential for ensuring the safety and security of critical areas. It requires a balance between maximizing coverage and managing operational constraints. This study addresses the complex Radar System Scheduling Problem, which involves efficiently allocating various radars across multiple sessions to maximize coverage while minimize the number of radars across all sessions. We propose a specialized Genetic Algorithm with custom operators to handle these constraints effectively. Additionally, we introduce a Stochastic Heuristic Initialization method to dynamically prioritize radar assignments, enhancing the flexibility and robustness of the scheduling process. By combining heuristic-based initialization, a constraint-preserving recombination operator, and a customized mutation method, our approach generates high-quality solutions that respect the problem’s many constraints. Our research demonstrates the adaptability of genetic algorithms to real-world problems, showing significant improvements in scheduling efficiency and operational flexibility.

  In this paper an initial formalization for a novel communication specification language in multi-agent systems (MASs) based on $$\varPi $$ Π -calculus and holonic MASs is introduced and analyzed. The novel language called Awkward $$\varPi $$ Π -nguin (or APi for short) is aimed towards modeling and execution of complex service oriented architectures, heterogeneous cloud systems, containerized microservice architectures and similar complex systems by specifying the communication flows between processed (agents) and organizing them hierarchically into holons. We provide a literature review and initial motivation for introducing a new language as well as give preliminary results of the language development process.

 Counterfactual Explanations for Sustainable Tourism Indicators  
  Counterfactual explanations are a well-known technique in Explainable Machine Learning (XML) to provide simple explanations on complex Machine Learning (ML) models. Through understandable “what if” scenarios, counterfactuals explore how changes in the input data affect the results of a model. This article leverages counterfactual explanations for sustainable tourism, an emerging approach within the tourism industry to mitigate the negative impacts of mass tourism on ecological systems and local communities. The proposed method analyzes the relationships between several Sustainable Tourism Indicators (STIs) defined for a specific tourist destination and its general sustainability assessment. It identifies the key changes needed in the STIs to achieve an improved global sustainability score. As a result, a decision-making system is offered for sustainable tourism management, which domain experts can use to make more informed decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through its application to Mallorca, a popular Spanish tourist destination.

 Tracking Healthy Organs in Medical Scans to Improve Cancer Treatment by Using UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation  
  This research presents our approaches to the Kaggle UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation Challenge. Radiation oncologists aim to emit X-ray beams targeted at the tumor while simultaneously avoiding the stomach and intestines. Oncologists can see where the tumor is located and administer a precise dose following the presence of tumor cells, which can change daily, thanks to more recent technologies like MR-Linacs. Currently, the task is to outline the location of the gastrointestinal tract (intestines and stomach) to change the direction of the X-ray beam such that the dose is sent to the tumor without touching the organs. This task can take from a few minutes to hours of treatment time unless there is an automated segmentation method that can automate the segmentation process. This research investigates an automated segmentation method based on deep learning that will quicken the segmentation process and eventually help more patients to benefit from effective treatments.

 Low Consumption Models for Disease Diagnosis in Isolated Farms  
  The detection of bacterial and viral microbes is pivotal for both human and animal well-being in public health services and veterinary care, but it traditionally requires time-consuming procedures and expert technicians. However, the rise of Machine Learning and Deep Learning has led to a surge in the application of new techniques that can perform bacterial and viral detection faster and at a lower cost. Yet, despite that success, Deep Learning approaches tend to have high energy demands, which can in some contexts limit their application, increasing both costs and environmental concerns. In this study, a new hybrid methodology, in which an Artificial Neural Network was combined with a more energy efficient Spiking Neural Network, was employed to develop a model able to classify 18 species of Eimeria parasites, affecting both rabbits and chickens, from microscope images. We show how significant energy savings can be obtained from SNN layers, while their use in the model can improve its performance.

 Fast and Scalable Recommendation Retrieval Model with Mixed Attention and Knowledge Distillation  
  Users’ purchase decisions are highly influenced not only by their general preferences, but also most recent interactions with a given platform or marketplace. In the case of gathering insights on user behaviour patterns, sequential recommendations are essential for any customer-oriented business, since they enable the prediction and suggestion of the next best basket or action for a user based on their past interactions. The advent of deep neural networks has enhanced the precision of analyzing patterns in sequential recommendations. However, these models are limited by their restricted memory scope and a tendency to prioritize currently popular items, which can decrease recommendation diversity. To address this issue, it is proposed to perform “injecting” of external item-item interaction knowledge, by synthesizing knowledge graph from previously known interactions, into the multi-head attention mechanism during model training, followed by knowledge distillation afterwards for faster inference. Obtained results indicate that the proposed model achieves high inference speed and exceptional precision, effectively addressing the limitations of existing sequential recommendation models.

 Federated Learning for Vietnamese SMS Spam Detection Using Pre-trained PhoBERT  
  SMS Spam Detection has increasingly garnered attention due to the widespread use of mobile devices. Currently, most SMS spam detection model training methods rely on centralized data collection, which poses numerous privacy threats and creates security vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information. This study aims to propose a training method that does not require data sharing between parties, based on a federated learning system. In this paper, we experiment with FedAvg, FedAvgM, and FedAdam algorithms using a fine-tuned PhoBERT model tailored for the SMS spam classification task. The results show that the FedAvg algorithm achieves high performance with an accuracy of 99.38% in the IID setting, while the FedAdam algorithm proves more effective in the Non-IID setting, yielding a model with an accuracy of up to 98.5%. This study demonstrates that models like PhoBERT trained with FL algorithms can achieve classification capabilities comparable to centralized data training methods, highlighting the significant potential of FL for natural language processing models without the need for centralized data collection.

 Deep Learning Inference on Edge: A Preliminary Device Comparison  
  The deployment and inference of Deep Learning models are investigated in this article on seven different Edge Computing (EC) devices. This study addresses the features, performance and limitations of the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX and Nano, Google Coral DevBoard and USB, Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, NXP i.MX8 Plus and Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 on Deep Learning inference. Fully Connected, Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are implemented to test these EC devices. The benchmarking focuses on the performance metrics: inference latency, increase in error metric, and power consumption. The results show considerable variability among devices, with the ZCU104 and Jetson Orin achieving the lowest latencies across most models without any increase in the error metric. At the same time, Coral devices exhibit increased latency and error for complex convolutional models. NVIDIA Jetson devices, ZCU104 and Neural Compute Stick 2 are the only devices that support LSTM inference. The study also highlights differences in power consumption, with USB accelerators being the most energy-efficient.

 Causal Explanation of Graph Neural Networks  
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are currently used in many real-world applications. With this notable spread, the development of sophisticated techniques for explaining their decisions becomes highly necessary. Although many works have been proposed in the aim of explaining their predictions, on different aspects, such as nodes, edges, and features, they all tend to generate the explanations as subgraphs. In this paper, we will show that relying only on explanatory subgraphs is not sufficient explanation tool, especially that these subgraphs could range from small graphs to untraceable ones within the same model. In this regard, we propose a causal explanation framework based on the rigorous structural model of causality. We show that our framework does not compete with existing explanation framework for GNNs, but rather acts as a complementary approach.

 Towards Reliable Drift Detection and Explanation in Text Data  
  When delivered to the market, machine learning models face new data which are possibly subject to novel characteristics – a phenomenon known as concept drift. As this might lead to performance degradation, it is necessary to detect such drift and, if required, adapt the model accordingly. While a variety of drift detection and adaptation methods exists for standard vectorial data, a suitable treatment of text data is less researched. In this work we present a novel approach which detects and explains drift in text data based on their representation via transformer embeddings.In a nutshell, the method generates suitable statistical features from the original distribution and the possibly shifted variation. Based on these representations, drift scores can be assigned to individual data points, allowing a visualization and human-readable characterization of the type of drift.We demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness in reliably detecting drift in several experiments.

 Using Diffusion Models for Data Augmentation on Limited Rodent OCT Datasets  
  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has transformed ophthalmology by enabling accurate diagnosis of retinal diseases. OCT in rodents is used in research studies of ophthalmic diseases and treatment evaluation. However, the scarcity of data limits the effectiveness of deep learning models for this purpose. This study explores the use of synthetic data generation to improve deep learning models for OCT image analysis from rodent retinas. To address this, the research leverages advanced class-conditional generative models to create high-quality synthetic images of ex-vivo rodent retinas embedded in two different mediums (solid resin and liquid media) with a reduced initial database. The conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) proved to be the best model, as it produces more realistic images that closely mimic the characteristics of real rodent retinal scans. By augmenting the training datasets with these synthetic images, the performance of deep learning models in segmenting retinal layers improved by 7%. This approach reduces reliance on scarce biological samples and animal testing, promoting ethical research practices while improving the accuracy and efficiency of AI-driven medical diagnostics. The integration of synthetic data generation represents a significant advance in medical imaging, offering a scalable solution to data scarcity, generating reliable samples in two mediums and promoting the development of more robust and accurate diagnostic tools.

 Employing Explainable AI Techniques for Air Pollution: An Ante-Hoc and Post-Hoc Approach in Dioxide Nitrogen Forecasting  
  With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in different areas of our society, namely with the use of Machine and Deep Learning models, some challenges must be faced. One of these challenges is responding to the lack of transparency in these models, which makes it difficult to explain the results they obtained. This research centres on predicting the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO $${_2}$$ 2 ), a critical air pollutant, using a Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM) along with applying Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand the predictions made. Two explainability techniques were applied: an ante-hoc approach with an Attention layer and a post-hoc approach using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The Attention layer identified carbon monoxide (CO) and NO $${_2}$$ 2 as the most powerful features, while the SHAP analysis highlighted NO $${_2}$$ 2 as the predominant contributor to the predictions, followed by particulate matter (PM $$_{2.5}$$ 2.5 ) and CO. The results demonstrated that the target value significantly impacts the model’s forecast for both XAI techniques.

 Predicting Employee Attrition in a Multi-company Setting  
  This paper describes the creation of a database and a machine learning model to predict employee attrition. Our proposal deals with attrition by considering 3 classes (voluntary, involuntary and no attritors) giving a more complete view of the loss of qualified personnel to the Human Resources Management. Of the several machine learning models tested to solve the problem, XGBoost stood out as the best performing one on a dataset with more than four thousand employees and twenty-one features collected from three independent companies from different industrial sectors. The model, evaluated on a 20-run experiment, achieved an overall mean accuracy of 78.5%, corresponding to the correct classification of 52.6% of the voluntary attritors, 78.9% of the involuntary attritors and 81.6% of the non-attritors, showing that voluntary attritors are harder to discriminate.

 A Deep-Learning Approach for the Identification of New Subtypes of Lung Cancer  
  Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer in the world. It is caused by unchecked cell division of damaged cells in the lungs forming tumors that eventually prevent the lung from functioning properly. Identification of novel unsupervised subtypes of lung cancer is critical to reveal new insights into the underlying biology of cancer and ensure that patients receive specialized precision treatment based on the subtype of cancer they are suffering from. The ability of modern sequencing tools to produce patient-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression data has transformed cancer research by offering in-depth understanding of the molecular landscape of cancer. This paper reports on a pipeline that comprise of a Deep Autoencoder (DAE) model coupled with hierarchical agglomerative clustering (H-Clust). It aims to identify new unsupervised lung cancer subtypes from RNA-seq expression samples collected from a publicly available dataset. Further, a deep learning (DL) model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to classify a patient’s data into one of the newly identified subtypes.

 Loss Function Role in Processing Sequences with Heavy-Tailed Distributions  
  Predicting the behavior of sequences in presence of long-tailed distributions is an important task in many applied industries, especially in medicine. Transformers and LSTM networks are most often used as handlers for this purpose, but the main efforts are aimed at suppressing deviations from normality rather than at their informative use. The paper discusses an alternative approach - the possibility of solving an auto-regression problem under conditions of input distributions with heavy tails while preserving information about significant deviations. Namely, we theoretically and experimentally consider the impact of the choice of loss function for processing sequences with heavy-tailed distributions performed by transformers and LSTMs. As a loss function, we analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (L1 Loss), and Cauchy Loss functions. On synthetic and real (COVID-19) data we showed that Cauchy and MAE losses perform 40% better than MSE loss according to sMAPE metric.

 Cooperative-Competitive Decision-Making in Resource Management: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective  
  This study presents a multi-agent approach to modeling deci-sion-making processes for cooperative-competitive game scenarios generated by long-tailed distributions. We introduce a novel simulation environment that aims to replicate real-world resource allocation challenges, particularly in healthcare settings. The environment incorporates dynamic changes in agents’ perceptions and utilizes heavy-tailed distributions to model unpredictable events. We adapt the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to this environment, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and strategy development. Our approach includes a role-based system and a two-component reward function that guides agents through the learning process. The results, evaluated using metrics such as cumulative reward, average episodic reward, and approximate Kullback-Leibler divergence, indicate successful learning and sufficent agent strategies. This research contributes to the field of multi-agent systems and resource management by providing a framework that can generalize learned policies to varying numbers of agents and resources, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with changing conditions.

 Improving Speech Emotion Recognition: Novel Aggregation Strategies for Self-supervised Features  
  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enhancing human-machine voice interactions, allowing systems to better interpret the speaker’s emotional state and improve user experience. Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have significantly advanced speech recognition by generating speech representations from large unlabeled corpus, which can then be fine-tuned with smaller labeled datasets for downstream tasks such as voice command detection, automatic transcription, speaker identification, and SER. However, SSL models are typically optimized for general tasks rather than emotion recognition. This poses a challenge, as the limited labeled data in SER can hinder the generalization capabilities of these models, making the choice of SSL architecture and training strategy vital. The most common procedure in Speech Emotion Recognition is performing an average time pooling of the SSL features to train classification models, which often leads to a loss of temporal relationships in the data. In this study, we introduce two novel SSL feature aggregation methods that leverage attention mechanisms to better capture temporal dependencies in speech data. These methods significantly enhance the extraction of relevant information from SSL features, leading to improvements in classification accuracy. Our proposed approach outperforms the standard average time pooling method, achieving up to a 6.3% increase in weighted accuracy (WA) on the IEMOCAP database.

 Refining Multiple Instance Learning with Attention Regularization for Whole Slide Image Classification  
  Histopathological analysis of biopsy sections is crucial for the detection of cancer and the distinction between different tumor subtypes. To this end, pathologists identify certain key regions of the biopsy from which a diagnosis is derived. The classification of whole slide images (WSIs) can be addressed as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem where only slide-level labels are available. In order to model the relevance scores of the different WSI patches, attention mechanisms are implemented within the MIL framework. However, excessive flexibility in the attention mechanisms for computing attention scores to patches may lead to nearly uniform attention distributions, potentially deteriorating the model’s performance. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised auxiliary loss function to recalibrate the attention mechanism enhancing emphasis on crucial patches and downscaling the influence of less relevant ones. The proposed MIL framework has been evaluated on invasive breast carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) and renal cell carcinoma (TCGA-RCC) subtyping. The results obtained show that attention regularization not only improves the predictive capacity of the model but also significantly increases its interpretability by identifying regions and patterns of high diagnostic value.

 Evaluating Performance and Trustworthiness of RAG Systems for Generating Administrative Text  
  As administrative language tends to be formal and exempt from double meanings or figurative expressions, it is a particular domain in which to explore the performance of Language Models. This paper presents a study on the feasibility of creating administrative texts-based RAG systems to serve as chatbots, analyzing the performance for this task of several Small and Large Language Models and defining ways of evaluating whether they hallucinate or not and whether they provide the user useful information or not. Conventional metrics depending on ground truth labels, such as cosine similarity or those from the ROUGE family, are explored, as well as new approaches to using other metrics not so popular in text evaluation, such as Euclidean and Manhattan distances. Moreover, all those objective metrics are compared with a subjective Likert scale to assess their performance at solving real users’ problems and to find relations between subjective perceptions and objectively measured metrics for each of the RAG systems proposed. The results show that SLM models (such as NeuralChat) can perform as well as an LLM if RAG programming provides them with an appropriate context.

 Blueprint of Tomorrow: Contrasting Off-Line and On-Line Drawing Tasks for Alzheimer’s Disease Screening  
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. Although there is currently no cure for AD, early detection of cognitive decline can help clinicians mitigate its impact. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been developed to automatically analyze handwriting and hand-drawing tasks to support the early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we study pentagon and clock drawing tests using both off-line (scanned image pixels) and on-line (discrete point sequences) data as input to several ML models (i.e., DensNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, RNN, LSTM, and GRU). Our study is the first to determine the most effective modality (on-line vs. off-line) and drawing tasks to distinguish healthy controls from AD patients (binary classification) as well as two stages of AD severity (multi-class classification). Our results suggest that, contrary to other domains, the off-line modality outperforms the on-line one, sometimes by a large margin: 90% vs. 60% accuracy in binary classification and 53% vs. 82% accuracy in multi-class classification. This suggests that, for drawing tasks and small-scale datasets, image-based representations may be more effective in predicting AD than those relying on more complex data representations.

 Digital Mental Health Apps: Key Features and User Engagement for Better Wellness  
  Given the global impact of mental disorders and the increasing prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as one of the main causes of disability, it is imperative to invest in solutions for self-management of mental health. Thus, the evolution of Digital Mental Health reveals a significant impact, with major investment in technologies that drive the development of projects that aim to innovate the benefits and results of this area. As part of the development of the RM4Health project, this work evaluated the role of web, desktop and/or mobile applications in the self-management of mental health, highlighting existing strengths and gaps. The study covered 205 applications for the management of mental health, detailing the panorama of current Behavioral Management practices, Persuasive Systems Design (PSD), Behavioral Economics (BE) principles and Security and Privacy strategies. The results obtained in this survey allow the definition of recommendations for the development of more effective, engaging, accessible and safe solutions, to promote autonomy in the management of the mental health condition. A high diversity of resources was observed, however areas of underutilization were identified, especially in BE approaches. It is recommended to combine Artificial Intelligence, Smart Coach and Gamification strategies with robust security and privacy measures. Furthermore, the development of comprehensive and intuitive solutions that prioritize key behavioral management functionalities, PSD resources and BE principles that involve the user in their own health management, regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with a mental disorder, were suggested. This study could guide future research and development in order to improve the quality of the user experience and drive advances in the field of Digital Mental Health.

 Automatic PDF Document Classification with Machine Learning  
  Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) faces challenges in managing its Alfresco document repository, which contains 600,000 PDF files, of which only 100,000 are correctly categorised. Manual classification is laborious and error-prone, hindering information retrieval and advanced search capabilities. This project presents an automated pipeline that integrates optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning to efficiently classify documents. Our approach distinguishes between scanned and digital documents, accurately extracts text and categorises it into 51 predefined categories using models such as BERT and RF. By improving document organisation and accessibility, this work optimises UPV’s document management and paves the way for advanced search technologies and real-time classification systems.

 Contributions on Mixtures of Polynomials for Hybrid Bayesian Networks  
  Bayesian networks based on mixtures of polynomials (MoPs) are used to model multivariate hybrid or continuous probability distributions. MoPs try to provide a flexible yet simple model to deal with probabilistic reasoning, approximating complex or empirical probability distributions. We review the main models based on MoPs in the literature, introducing the mixtures of polynomials with tails (tMoPs) and derive analytically their main statistical properties: (cumulative) distribution function, moments, variance and moment-generating function. Also, we present an algorithm for learning a tMOPs density from data. This learning algorithm is tested with several standard probability distributions. In these experiments, the tMOPs models yield satisfactory results in comparison to other MoPs available alternatives. Finally, we sketch the process of building a meta-model that can directly provide a tMOPs expression for a specific density among a given family. This idea is tested with the well-known Beta distribution (two shape parameters), giving promising results.

 Age-Unbiased Facial Emotion Recognition with Regularizing Self-Attention Value Vector  
  Facial emotion recognition (FER) is a challenging task that involves analyzing emotions based on attributes entangled with the face in an image. The FER model inherently possesses age bias because age-related features such as wrinkles and skin texture can create confusion in understanding the emotions of the elderly and decrease accuracy. This paper proposes a FER method that mitigates age bias by applying adversarial regularization to the value vector of self-attention, which is related to age attributes, to minimize information loss. The proposed method focuses on removing biases without affecting the landmarks that make up facial emotions, as key and query vectors in the attention are associated with facial landmarks while value vector is associated with textural features of the image. An age discriminator interrupts age information in value vectors and restores information through the emotion classifier to minimize excessive loss. Experimental results with two FER datasets, RAF-DB and FACES, show that the proposed method yields superior accuracy while reducing bias compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

 Assessing the Impact of Temporal Data Aggregation on the Reliability of Predictive Machine Learning Models  
  In time series analysis, data aggregation is an essential preprocessing step that consolidates data points over specified time intervals, simplifying the data structure and reducing noise. This process is vital for enhancing the manageability of large, complex datasets, commonly encountered in various domains such as energy consumption forecasting. However, the choice of the most appropriate temporal aggregation (TA) frequency can significantly impact the performance and the reliability of predictive models. Different TA frequencies may perform better in different scenarios, and there is a lack of evidence on what indicators may determine the superiority of each one. In this study, we design and execute an empirical experiment framework to first explore the performance of various machine learning (ML) models using different TA frequencies on 04 multivariate time series datasets of ship fuel consumption. We further investigate the reliability of those models by studying the marginal contribution of the time series features in each aggregation period. Using the Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, LightGBM, and Extra Trees predictive models along with the Shapley Additive Explanations to analyze feature contributions, we found that time series aggregation consistently produces accurate results regardless of the TA period. However, the models may exhibit significant biases, highlighting the need to examine their inner workings to select the appropriate TA period.

 Structural and Semantic Data Layers in Time Series Analyses  
  Understanding the inherent complexity of temporal data is crucial for effective time series analytics. One dimension of complexity is the level of structural depth at which analysis methods operate. These levels range from entire time series collections down to individual sequences of reduced dimensionality and length. Complementary to this type of complexity, is the quantity and expressiveness of knowledge associated with time series data, including labels and other features that provide valuable information. Both, the structural as well as the semantic layer, define the suitability and effectiveness of different analysis methods. In this paper we introduce a conceptual framework to support the automated selection of analytical time series approaches. To this end, we specify a context-free grammar to describe hierarchies and compositions of time series data, while also defining different classes of semantic information, resulting in a data-specific classification of time series analysis methods. Along with a demonstration via concrete examples, we provide a discussion on challenges, opportunities and future work associated with the proposed approach.

 About IE2025  
 A convention, in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest. The most common conventions are based upon industry, profession, and fandom. Trade conventions typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers.  
 Professional conventions focus on issues of concern along with advancements related to the profession. Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest. Fan conventions usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities. Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions.

  Emerging Researchers in ALife 

 Welcome to Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA)   

 We are the student chapter of ISAL, committed to fostering the next generation of Artificial Life researchers. ERA  brings together a diverse and dynamic community of emerging researchers, offering a space to connect, collaborate, and contribute to the exciting field of Artificial Life.  
 Since our founding in 2016, ERA  has been at the forefront of supporting early-career scientists—whether you’re a PhD student, postdoctoral researcher, or an independent scholar. We provide opportunities to engage with the broader Artificial Life community, including hosting an annual workshop at the flagship Artificial Life Conference  , where emerging researchers can network, share ideas, and build lasting professional relationships.  
   
 Our definition of “emerging researcher” is inclusive—if you see yourself as one, you’re part of our community!

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 The IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC), sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, is a major annual international conference. Taking advantage of its co-location with the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which is the world's largest tradeshow on consumer technology, CCNC is organized with the objective of bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry working in all areas of consumer communications and networking technologies. CCNC 2025 will feature high-quality keynotes, plenary talks, technical and industry papers, panels, tutorials, and demonstrations. In addition, the CCNC 2025 Organization Committee invites members of the research, development, and practitioner communities to submit Workshop and Special Session proposals. Workshops provide a forum for people to discuss areas of special interest with like-minded researchers and practitioners. Special Sessions complement the main program with new or emerging topics that are of particular interest to the consumer communications and networking community and may also cut across and beyond disciplines traditionally represented at CCNC. Research contributions are welcome in all areas pertinent to consumer communications and networking, including:

 Visa requirements  

 Planning Your Trip to Madrid  
 As you prepare to join us for the 51th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronic Society in Madrid, it is important to ensure that you have all the necessary travel documents. Here are key details regarding visa requirements and how to prepare for your journey to Spain.  
 Do You Need a Visa?  
 EU Citizens | : If you are a citizen of the European Union, you do not require a visa to enter Spain. 
  Non-EU Citizens | : Citizens from many countries outside the EU may enter Spain without a visa for stays up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes. Please check | the full list of countries | whose nationals are exempted from visa requirements. 
  Visa-Required Entry | : If your country is not on the exempt list, you will need to obtain a Schengen visa. This allows you to travel throughout the Schengen Area for stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period. 
  How to Apply for a Visa  
 Determine Visa Type | : Most attendees will require a short-stay Schengen visa. 
  Locate Your Nearest Consulate | : Applications must be filed at the Spanish consulate or embassy in your home country. 
  Schedule an Appointment | : Some consulates require an appointment, so make sure to book yours as soon as possible. 
  Prepare Required Documents | : 
  A valid passport 
  Proof of travel plans (including a copy of your registration to the congress) 
  Accommodation details 
  Travel insurance that covers medical emergencies 
  Proof of financial means for the duration of your stay 
  Visa Requirements  
 What specific documents you will need to carry with you when you travel to Spain all depends on your nationality. People travelling to Spain who are not part of the European Union or the Schengen Area and who need a visa must obtain the necessary permits, such as the ETIAS   (only as from 2025).  
 Processing Times   
 Visa processing typically takes about 15 calendar days from the date of application. However, it may take longer during peak travel seasons or under special circumstances. We recommend applying as early as possible.  
 Additional Tips   
 Letter of Invitation | : Upon request, we can provide a letter of invitation that you may use as part of your visa application. 
  Travel Health Insurance | : Ensure that your insurance covers medical expenses with a minimum coverage of €30,000 within the Schengen area. 
  Covid-19 Measures | : Please stay updated on travel restrictions or health requirements related to Covid-19 by checking official resources or our event updates. 
  For further assistance or to request a letter of invitation, please contact our registration team. We look forward to welcoming you to Madrid!  
 Invitation Letter Request  
 To request a personalised invitation letter, please email to IECON 2025 Tecnhical Secretariat info@iecon2025.org  . Please allow at least five business days to receive your letter via email .  
 Note that IECON 2025 technical secretariat cannot contact any embassies on your behalf.  
  Applicants should bring all relevant documents with them to their interview.  
  Furthermore, IECON 2025 technical secretariat has no control over the visa application process or the decision of the visa adjudicator in the embassy or consulate.
