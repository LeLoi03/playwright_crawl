 First Call for Shared Task Proposals for RANLP 2025  
 We invite proposals for tasks to be run as part of RANLP 2025 (Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing): https://ranlp.org/ranlp2025/  .  
 RANLP is one of the most influential and competitive NLP conferences. RANLP 2025 will take place in September 2025 at the Black Sea city of Varna. For the first time in RANLP history, we are organising a shared task campaign as part of the main conference and inviting task organisers to submit their task proposals. Researchers and practitioners from all areas of Natural Language Processing and related communities are invited to submit task proposals.  
 For RANLP 2025, we welcome any task that can evaluate an automatic system for natural language processing. We especially encourage tasks for languages other than English, multi-lingual tasks, and tasks that develop novel applications of natural language processing.  
 We strongly encourage proposals based on already published datasets, as this can provide concrete examples and help minimise the challenges of organising the shared task. In the event of receiving many proposals, preference will be given to proposals based on already published datasets.  
 If you are unsure whether a task is suitable, please contact the shared task chairs to discuss your idea.  
 Task Selection  
 Task proposals will be reviewed by at least two reviewers, and the reviews will serve as the basis for acceptance decisions. Task proposals will be evaluated on:  
 · Novelty - Is the task based on a new problem that has not been explored much in the community? If similar tasks have been organised before, does this task cover new languages/ domains?  
 · Data – Is the data available and published already? Do annotations have meaningfully high inter-annotator agreements? Have all appropriate licenses for the use and re-use of the data been secured?  
 · Evaluation—Is the evaluation methodology sound? Is there an automated platform for the evaluation (e.g., CodaLab, Kaggle)?  
 Task Organisation  
 We specifically welcome task proposals from early career researchers. However, we strongly encourage tasks that have a diverse team of organisers as that will ease the task organisation. Apart from providing a dataset, task organisers are expected to:  
 1. Verify data quality in terms of annotator agreement.  
 2. Verify licenses for the data to allow its use in the competition.  
 3. Provide task participants with baseline systems.  
 4. Create a CodaLab or other similar evaluation platform for the task and manage automatic evaluation.  
 5. Promote the task within the target research community.  
 6. Manage and organise review process of participants' submissions of system description papers.  
 7. Write a task description paper to be included in RANLP proceedings.  
 8. Contribute to the tasks overview paper written by shared task chairs and other task organisers which will also be included in RANLP proceedings.  
 9. Register and present the shared task description paper at RANLP 2025 on either 11th or 12th September 2025 (the exact date will be confirmed later)

 List of Topics  
  ------------------  
  Just as coding assistants have dramatically increased productivity for coding tasks over the last two years, researchers in the NLP community have begun to explore methods and opportunities ahead for creating scientific assistants that can help with the process of scientific discovery and increase the pace at which novel discoveries are made. Over the last year, language models have been used to create problem-general scientific discovery assistants that are not restricted to narrow problem domains or formulations. Such applications hold opportunities for assisting researchers in broad domains, or scientific reasoning more generally. Beyond assisting, a growing body of work has begun to focus on the prospect of creating largely autonomous scientific discovery agents that can make novel discoveries with minimal human intervention.  
 These recent developments highlight the possibility of rapidly accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in the near term. Given the influx of researchers into this expanding field, this workshop proposes to serve as a vehicle for bringing together a diverse set of perspectives from this quickly expanding subfield, helping to disseminate the latest results, standardize evaluation, foster collaboration between groups, and allow discussing aspirational goals for 2025 and beyond. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  
 ***Literature-based Discovery:*** This topic focuses on using existing scientific articles to facilitate novel discoveries, by finding “undiscovered public knowledge’’, conditioning novel studies based on existing work, or easing the search and reading process. Systems that read the literature at scale may ultimately help us come up with research ideas that are more novel, broader in scope, and operationalized in more useful experiments.  
 ***Agent-centered Approaches:*** Agent models are being used to form end-to-end scientific discovery pipelines, with separate agents taking on different roles, such as hypothesis generation, execution, and reviewing experiments.  
 ***Automated Experiment Execution:*** Agents that can automatically execute experiments require a large number of pragmatic skills that emerging benchmarks are beginning to evaluate, including downloading data, writing code, and interfacing with apps.  
 ***Automated Replication:*** Science is generally suffering a “reproducibility crisis”, and NLP is not immune to this, with (for example) 59% of reproducibility attempts finding worse performance than papers originally reported. Automated reproducibility attempts to read original papers, Github repositories, and instructions, to replicate experiments fully automatically.  
 ***Data-driven Discovery:*** Reading existing papers and combining or re-analyzing existing datasets frequently allows for novel data-driven discoveries without having to collect new data empirically, and may yield inexpensive novel discoveries.  
 ***Discovery in Virtual Environments:*** Virtual environments, including text-based simulations, allow training and evaluating agents at aspects of the scientific discovery process in simulated proxy tasks without running physical experiments, which are costly and time consuming.  
 ***Discovery with Humans in the Loop:*** How can we make the textual knowledge from literature best engage with humans in the discovery process, through various interfaces, processes, and surfaces?  
 ***Assistants for Scientific Writing:*** Language models can be used as assistants in the scientific dissemination process, either as planners for writing text such as academic articles, or blog posts intended for public consumption.  
 Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------  
  We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular archival workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the OpenReview website set up for this workshop ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.  
 ***Archival, regular workshop papers:*** Authors should submit a paper up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome), with unlimited pages for references, following the ACL author guidelines. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers.  
  Non-archival regular workshop papers: This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date.  
 ***Non-archival cross-submissions:*** We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that have already appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the AISD audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.  
  In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.  
 Note to authors: While you submit your paper through OpenReview ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ), please select the “Submission Type” properly based on the guidelines.  
 For questions about the submission guidelines, please contact workshop organizers via aisd-organizers  [at] googlegroups.com

 Real-Time Embedded Systems, Design Automation & Cyber-Physical Systems (Conferences Tracking)  
    
 ( Last updated:   2024-11-22 21:23:03 +0000)  
 Tracking the most influenced conferences in real-time  systems, embedded systems  , design automation  and robotics  . The idea of this tracker is to keep up-to-date information of conferences, to facilitate researchers within our community aware of the deadlines and important announcements/updates.  
 This list is updated on a frequent basis (normally weekly). The list is ordered by deadlines  before the submission deadline, otherwise it will be ordered by the conference opening date  . Deadline is in digits, with the format yyyy-mm-dd  , to reduce confusion due to conventions of different countries. The deadline is for the main conference. Brief presentations, workshops and industrial tracks often have a different (and later) deadline.  
 Contributing to this list:   This list is for the community’s common benefit thus it is therefore a shared responsibility  to make sure the contents in this list are correct to the best knowledge. If you want to add to the list or report an error, you can either (1) commit an issue in the issue list  , (2) contact me through email: xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk  , and (3) fill our feedback form  . If you prefer to change it yourself, you can clone, modify and create a pull request (PR) in GitHub.  
 Caution of time zones:   Note that some of the conference deadlines are in local time zones, but most are AoE, i.e., anywhere on earth (UTC-12:00). Please be aware of the time zone, especially when the deadline is approaching. Also note that the deadlines are for the full manuscript submission, but some of the conferences may have a deadline for abstract (normally one week earlier), which will be noted in the Remarks  section, even if it is not mandatory.  
 Maintainer:   This page and the GitHub repository are maintained by Dr. Steven Xiaotian Dai   from Real-Time and Distributed Systems Group, University of York, UK. If you find this site useful, please bookmark this page and star this repository on GitHub  .

  In order to speed up publication, the JSA has adopted the Virtual Special Issue model, whereby acceptance decisions are made on a rolling basis. On that account, authors are encouraged to submit as early as they can, no later than 16 January 2022. Authors who have successfully passed the first round of review will be invited to present their work at the conference  . Ada‐Europe, the main conference sponsor, will cover the Open Access fees for the first four papers  to gain final acceptance which do not already enjoy OA from personalized bilateral agreements with the Publisher.  
 Prospective authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track to the corresponding chair, Jérôme Hugues  .  
  Call for Industrial‐track Submissions  
 The conference seeks industrial practitioner presentations  that deliver insight on the challenges of developing reliable software. Given their applied nature, such contributions will be subject to a dedicated practitioner‐peer review process.  

 Interested authors shall submit a short (one‐to‐two pages) abstract  , by 27 February 2022 via Easy Chair  , strictly in PDF following the Ada User Journal  style.  
  The abstract of the accepted contributions will be included in the conference booklet. The corresponding authors will get a presentation slot in the prime‐time technical program of the conference, and will also be invited to expand their contributions into full‐fledged articles for publication in the Ada User Journal, which will form the proceedings of the Industrial track of the Conference.  
 The Industrial Track welcomes contributions that fit the general scope of the conference  , and actively address the perspective of practitioners on the topic of interest. Especially welcome are submissions of the following kind:  
 Experience with languages, tools, methodologies, and products for the achievement of safety and reliability in large or complex projects and systems. 
  Lessons learned in the design, implementation and deployment of reliable software, high-integrity systems, real-time and embedded systems, etc. 
  Insights into language tools and libraries that incorporate or target reliability in software. 
  Reports and highlights from ongoing or completed challenging projects where software is a critical component of the system. 
  Practical hands-on sharing of knowledge gained in the practice of building reliable software. 
  Reliable Software Technologies 
   
 Prospective authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track to the corresponding chair Alejandro R. Mosteo  .  
  Call for Work‐in‐Progress‐track Submissions  
 The Work‐in‐Progress track seeks two kinds of submissions: (a) ongoing research  , and (b) early‐stage ideas  . Ongoing research  submissions are 4‐page papers that describe research results that are not mature enough to be submitted to the journal track as yet. Early‐stage ideas  , are 1‐page papers that pitch new research directions that fall in the scope of the conference.  
 Topics addressed by the WIP track are close by the journal track:  
 Real-Time and Safety-Critical Systems 
  High-Integrity Systems and Reliability 
  Reliability-oriented Programming Languages 
  Experience Reports 
   
 The WIP track is expected to address emerging areas where reliability is a first class requirement. WIP submissions may cover new application domains, new technologies, and new methods related to reliable software, such as autonomous systems, IoT, Industries 4.0, IA for critical systems, Cloud/Edge, security, energy management, etc.  
 Both kinds of submission must be original and shall undergo anonymous peer review. Submissions by recent MSc graduates and PhD students are especially sought.  

 Authors shall submit their work by 27 February 2022, via Easy Chair  , strictly in PDF, following the Ada User Journal  style.  
  The abstract of the accepted contributions will be included in the conference booklet. The corresponding authors will get a presentation slot in the prime‐time technical program of the conference, and will also be offered the opportunity to expand their contributions into 4‐page articles for publication in the Ada User Journal which will form the proceedings of the WiP track of the Conference.  
 Prospective authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track to the corresponding chair Frank Singhoff  .

8. Conference RuleML+RR_2:
Web Reasoning and Rule Systems Association (RRA)  
 The Web Reasoning and Rule Systems Association  (RRA) is a non-profit organisation founded in 2009 whose objective is to promote the scientific aspects of Web-based reasoning and rule systems, with an emphasis on principles and applications of rule-based approaches and languages. The reasoning landscape features theoretical areas such as knowledge representation (KR) and algorithms; design aspects of rule markup; design of ontology languages; engineering of engines, translators, and other tools; standardization efforts such as the Rules Interchange Format activity ( RIF  ) at W3C and the RDF Mapping Language ( RML  ); and applications. Of particular interest is also the use of rules to facilitate ontology modeling, and the relationships and possible interactions between rules and languages used in knowledge representation, like RDF, OWL, and RML as well as reasoning related to such formalisms. RRA's purpose is implemented in particular by conducting an annual event, which since 2017 is organized jointly with the RuleML Association, and which since 2020 takes place under the umbrella of the Declarative AI  event. Within Declarative AI, RRA is responsible for:  
 The | International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning | (RuleML+RR), organized jointly with the RuleML Association. RuleML+RR is the leading international conference in rule-based reasoning, devoted to theoretical advancements, novel technologies, and innovative applications of knowledge representation and reasoning with rules. RuleML+RR features the Rule Challenge and a Doctoral Consortium as associated events. 
  The | Reasoning Web Summer School | (RW), which disseminates recent advances on reasoning and related issues that are of interest to Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. It is primarily intended for postgraduate (PhD or MSc) students, postdocs, young researchers, and senior researchers. Since 2011, the Reasoning Web Summer School has been co-located with the conference organized by RRA. 
  The International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems (RR) aims to be the major forum for discussion and dissemination of new results on all topics concerning Web Reasoning and Rule Systems. This joint conference is devoted to all aspects of Semantic Web Reasoning, with an emphasis on rule-based approaches and languages. It welcomes both theoretical and practical works on this wide subject.

 ... Runtime verification (RV) (or monitoring) [9, 2]  is a well-established technique to check whether the current execution of a program satisfies a property of interest. In the last years, RV has increasingly gained popularity in both the formal verification and software engineering communities, because in most of the cases it reveals to be more practical than exhaustive verification techniques such as model checking [5,12] and more versatile than classical software testing. ...

 We discuss the problem of runtime verification of an instrumented program that misses to emit and to monitor some events. These gaps can occur when a monitoring overhead control mechanism is introduced to disable the monitor of an application with real-time constraints. We show how to use statistical models to learn the application behavior and to "fill in" the introduced gaps. Finally, we present and discuss some techniques developed in the last three years to estimate the probability that a property of interest is violated in the presence of an incomplete trace.

 The use of driving assistance systems up to the level of autonomous cars asks for methods showing that cars equipped with such systems behave safely. In previous work, we realised that spatial reasoning is a key to prove collision freedom. Our method was based on a dedicated Multi-lane Spatial Logic (MLSL) for traffic on motorways [10].In this paper, we extend this approach by taking into account the plans of cars in the near future up to a certain time bound. We employ runtime monitoring of car traffic on motorways using extended State Clock automata for State Clock Logic (SCL) as defined in [17]. The extensions are that the SC automata use MLSL formulae as propositional symbols as in Timed MLSL [2] and communication primitives as in Timed Automata of UPPAAL. The idea is that a car can perform a traffic manoeuvre like a lane change only if it successfully communicates with all surrounding cars that check their internal extended SC automata for compliance with their safety and time constraints in the near future.KeywordsMulti-lane Spatial LogicState Clock AutomataBounded Runtime Enforcement

 Twenty years have passed since the first workshop on runtime verification—the area has grown and evolved with hundreds of papers published and a sizeable number of mature tools developed. In a special occasion like this it is good to look back, but it is also good to look forward to the future. In this paper, we outline a very brief history of runtime verification, and propose a way of passing the knowledge down to future generations of academics and industry practitioners in the form of a roadmap for teaching runtime verification. The proposal, based on our experience, not only equips students with the fundamental theory underpinning runtime verification, but also ensures they have the required skills to engineer it into industrial systems. Our hope is that this would increase uptake and eventually give rise to the establishment of industry-grade tools.

 Fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) subsystems are an accepted technique to make safety-critical systems resilient against faults and failures. Yet, these subsystems should be devised only for those faults that violate the system’s requirements, while providing a correct approach such that requirements are met again. As a consequence, the obtained system is minimal, although complete, and robust both with respect to safety and performance requirements. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automated approach based on formal methods that includes (1) the evaluation of the relevance of faults based on quantitative risk assessment, and (2) the validation of system robustness by statistical model checking. We apply this approach on an excerpt of a real-life autonomous robotics case study, and we report on the implementation and results obtained with the S  BIP   \mathcal {S}\text {BIP}      framework.

 Test driven development (TDD) is a technique where test cases are used to guide the development of a system. This technique introduces several advantages at the time of developing a system, e.g. writing clean code, good coverage for the features of the system, and evolutionary development. In this paper we show how the capabilities of a testing focused development methodology based on TDD and model-based testing, can be enhanced by integrating static and runtime verification into its workflow. Considering that the desired system properties capture data- as well as control-oriented aspects, we integrate TDD with (static) deductive verification as an aid in the development of the data-oriented aspects, and we integrate model-based testing with runtime verification as an aid in the development of the control-oriented aspects. As a result of this integration, the proposed development methodology features the benefits of TDD and model-based testing, enhanced with, for instance, early detection of bugs which may be missed by TDD, regarding data aspects, and the validation of the overall system with respect to the model, regarding the control aspects.

 This article introduces the extended versions of selected papers from the refereed proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV 2016) held in Madrid, Spain, in September 2016. Runtime verification encompasses all aspects of monitoring and analysis of hardware, software, and system executions in general. Runtime verification techniques are lightweight dynamic techniques to assess and enforce correctness, reliability, and robustness during system execution. These techniques are significantly more powerful and versatile than conventional testing, and more practical than exhaustive formal verification (at the price of incomplete coverage).

 Users wanting to monitor distributed or component-based systems often perceive them as monolithic systems which, seen from the outside, exhibit a uniform behaviour as opposed to many components displaying many local behaviours that together constitute the system’s global behaviour. This level of abstraction is often reasonable, hiding implementation details from users who may want to specify the system’s global behaviour in terms of a linear-time temporal logic (LTL) formula. However, the problem that arises then is how such a specification can actually be monitored in a distributed system that has no central data collection point, where all the components’ local behaviours are observable. In this case, the LTL specification needs to be decomposed into sub-formulae which, in turn, need to be distributed amongst the components’ locally attached monitors, each of which sees only a distinct part of the global behaviour. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for distributing and monitoring LTL formulae, such that satisfaction or violation of specifications can be detected by local monitors alone. We present an implementation and show that our algorithm introduces only a negligible delay in detecting satisfaction/violation of a specification. Moreover, our practical results show that the communication overhead introduced by the local monitors is generally lower than the number of messages that would need to be sent to a central data collection point. Furthermore, our experiments strengthen the argument that the algorithm performs well in a wide range of different application contexts, given by different system/communication topologies and/or system event distributions over time.

 Software health management (SWHM) is an emerging field which addresses the critical need to detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events due to software faults and failures. These faults could arise for numerous reasons including coding errors, unanticipated faults or failures in hardware, or problematic interactions with the external environment. This paper demonstrates a novel approach to software health management based on a rigorous Bayesian formulation that monitors the behavior of software and operating system, performs probabilistic diagnosis, and provides information about the most likely root causes of a failure or software problem. Translation of the Bayesian network model into an efficient data structure, an arithmetic circuit, makes it possible to perform SWHM on resource-restricted embedded computing platforms as found in aircraft, unmanned aircraft, or satellites. SWHM is especially important for safety critical systems such as aircraft control systems. In this paper, we demonstrate our Bayesian SWHM system on three realistic scenarios from an aircraft control system: (1) aircraft file-system based faults, (2) signal handling faults, and (3) navigation faults due to inertial measurement unit (IMU) failure or compromised Global Positioning System (GPS) integrity. We show that the method successfully detects and diagnoses faults in these scenarios. We also discuss the importance of verification and validation of SWHM systems.

 This paper reports on the modelling and analysis of a microgrid with wind, microturbines, and the main grid as generation resources. The microgrid is modelled as a parallel composition of various stochastic hybrid automata. Extensive simulation runs of the behaviour of the main individual microgrid components give insight into the complex dynamics of the system and provide useful information to determine adequate parameter settings. The analysis of the microgrid focuses on determining the probability of linear temporal logic properties expressed in the logic LTL, using the statistical model checker Uppaal-SMC.

 Temporal-Logic Based Runtime Observer Pairs for System Health Management of Real-Time Systems

 We propose a real-time, Realizable, Responsive, Unobtrusive Unit (rt-R2U2) to meet the emerging needs for System Health Management (SHM) of new safety-critical embedded systems like automated vehicles, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), or small satellites. SHM for these systems must be able to handle unexpected situations and adapt specifications quickly during flight testing between closely-timed consecutive missions, not mid-mission, necessitating fast reconfiguration. They must enable more advanced probabilistic reasoning for diagnostics and prognostics while running aboard limited hardware without affecting the certified on-board software. We define and prove correct translations of two real-time projections of Linear Temporal Logic to two types of efficient observer algorithms to continuously assess the status of the system. A synchronous observer yields an instant abstraction of the satisfaction check, whereas an asynchronous observer concretizes this abstraction at a later, a priori known, time. By feeding the system's real-time status into a statistical reasoning unit, e.g., based on Bayesian networks, we enable advanced health estimation and diagnosis. We experimentally demonstrate our novel framework on real flight data from NASA's Swift UAS. By on-boarding rt-R2U2 aboard an existing FPGA already built into the standard UAS design and seamlessly intercepting sensor values through read-only observations of the system bus, we avoid system integration problems of software instrumentation or added hardware. The flexibility of our approach with regard to changes in the monitored specification is not due to the reconfigurability offered by FPGAs; it is a benefit of the modularity of our observers and would also be available on non-reconfigurable hardware platforms such as ASICs.

 Dynamic programming languages, such as PHP, JavaScript, and Python, provide built-in data structures including associative arrays and objects with similar semantics-object properties can be created at run-time and accessed via arbitrary expressions. While a high level of security and safety of applications written in these languages can be of a particular importance (consider a web application storing sensitive data and providing its functionality worldwide), dynamic data structures pose significant challenges for data-flow analysis making traditional static verification methods both unsound and imprecise. In this paper, we propose a sound and precise approach for value and points-to analysis of programs with associative arrays-like data structures, upon which data-flow analyses can be built. We implemented our approach in a web-application domain-in an analyzer of PHP code.

 Efficient Parametric Runtime Verification with Deterministic String Rewriting    
   
 Conference Paper    
 Nov 2013 

 Patrick Meredith 
  Grigore Roşu 
    
 Early efforts in runtime verification show that parametric regular and temporal logic specifications can be monitored efficiently. These approaches, however, have limited expressiveness: their specifications always reduce to monitors with finite state. More recent developments showed that parametric context-free properties can be efficiently monitored with overheads generally lower than 12–15%. While context-free grammars are more expressive than finite-state languages, they still do not allow every computable safety property. This paper presents a monitor synthesis algorithm for string rewriting systems (SRS). SRSs are well known to be Turing complete, allowing for the formal specification of any computable safety property. Earlier attempts at Turing complete monitoring have been relatively inefficient. This paper demonstrates that monitoring parametric SRSs is practical. The presented algorithm uses a modified version of Aho-Corasick string searching for quick pattern matching with an incremental rewriting approach that avoids reexamining parts of the string known to contain no redexes.

 Software health management: A necessity for safety critical systems    
   
 Article    
 Dec 2013 

 Ashok N. Srivastava 
  Johann Schumann 
    
 As software and software intensive systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, the impact of failures can be tremendous. In some industries such as aerospace, medical devices, or automotive, such failures can cost lives or endanger mission success. Software faults can arise due to the interaction between the software, the hardware, and the operating environment. Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission. Latent coding errors can at any time during system operation trigger faults despite the fact that usually a significant effort has been expended in verification and validation (V&V) of the software system. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly more apparent that pre-deployment V&V is not enough to guarantee that a complex software system meets all safety, security, and reliability requirements. Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies, while the system is in operation. The prognostic capability of the SWHM to detect and diagnose failures before they happen will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future. This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline and motivates the need for SWHM in safety critical applications.

 Sampling-based Decentralized Monitoring for Networked Embedded Systems    
   
 Article    
 Full-text available    
 Aug 2013 

 Ezio Bartocci 
    
 Decentralized monitoring (DM) refers to a monitoring technique, where each component must infer, based on a set of partial observations if the global property is satisfied. Our work is inspired by the theoretical results presented by Baurer and Falcone at FM 2012, where the authors introduced an algorithm for distributing and monitoring LTL formulae, such that satisfaction or violation of specifications can be detected by local monitors alone. However, their work is based on the main assumption that neither the computation nor communication take time, hence it does not take into account how to set a sampling time among the components such that their local traces are consistent. In this work we provide a timed model in UPPAAL and we show a case study on a networked embedded systems board.

 Runtime verification of service-oriented systems: A well-rounded survey    
   
 Article

 Aug 2013

 Dynamic nature of Service-Oriented Systems (SOSs) has made conventional verification techniques such as testing, model checking and theorem proving ineffective. As a result, many studies have been dedicated to verification of SOS. In this survey, we first discuss why the conventional verification techniques are not effectively applicable to SOSs and then stress the necessity of the runtime verification as a dynamic approach that formally checks the system behaviour at runtime. To provide a deep comparison between existing studies and to draw a clear road map for the future studies, we introduce the salient characteristics of the runtime verification in SOSs. In addition, we survey a significant number of various studies in the literature by categorising them in five broad categories: logic and calculus oriented approaches, workflow monitoring, state-based conformity assessment, aspect-oriented verification, and SLA-driven compliance. Then, we deal with the comparison between the defined categories and finally discuss open problems.

 This paper presents novel extensions and applications of the UPPAAL-SMC model checker. The extensions allow for statistical model checking of stochastic hybrid systems. We show how our race-based stochastic semantics extends to networks of hybrid systems, and indicate the integration technique applied for implementing this semantics in the UPPAAL-SMC simulation engine. We report on two applications of the resulting tool-set coming from systems biology and energy aware buildings.

 This paper studies the problem of computing Nash equilibrium in wireless networks modeled by Weighted Timed Automata. Such formalism comes together with a logic that can be used to describe complex features such as timed energy constraints. Our contribution is a method for solving this problem using Statistical Model Checking. The method has been implemented in UPPAAL model checker and has been applied to the analysis of Aloha CSMA/CD and IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA protocols.

 Monitoring-Oriented Programming: A Tool-Supported Methodology for Higher Quality Object-Oriented Software    
   
 Article    

 Feng Chen 
  Marcelo d’Amorim 
  Grigore Rosu 
    
 This paper presents a tool-supported methodological paradigm for object-oriented software development, called monitoring-oriented programming and abbreviated MOP, in which runtime monitoring is a basic software design principle. The general idea underlying MOP is that software developers insert specifications in their code via annotations. Actual monitoring code is automatically synthesized from these annotations before compilation and integrated at appropriate places in the program, according to user-defined configuration attributes. This way, the specification is checked at runtime against the implementation. Moreover, violations and/or validations of specifications can trigger user-defined code at any points in the program, in particular recovery code, outputting or sending messages, or raising exceptions. The MOP paradigm does not promote or enforce any specific formalism to specify requirements: it allows the users to plug-in their favorite or domain-specific specification formalisms via logic plug-in modules. There are two major technical challenges that MOP supporting tools unavoidably face: monitor synthesis and monitor integration. The former is heavily dependent on the specification formalism and comes as part of the corresponding logic plug-in, while the latter is uniform for all specification formalisms and depends only on the target programming language. An experimental prototype tool, called Java-MOP, is also discussed, which currently supports most but not all of the desired MOP features. MOP aims at reducing the gap between formal specification and implementation, by integrating the two and allowing them together to form a system.

  Testing is often difficult, and testing real-time embedded systems for mission-critical applications is particularly difficult owing to embedded design complexities and frequent requirements changes. Embedded systems usually require a series of rigorous white-box (structural), black-box (functional), module, and integration testing before developers can release them to the market. In practice, ... [Show full abstract]  functional testing is often more important than structural testing. Similarly, integration testing is more challenging than module testing. Furthermore, functional integration testing often requires individual test scripts based on the system requirements.

  Michael Tautschnig 
  Interrupt-driven software is difficult to test and debug, especially when interrupts can be nested and subject to priorities. Interrupts can arrive at arbitrary times, leading to an explosion in the number of cases to be considered. We present a new formal approach to verifying interrupt-driven software based on symbolic execution. The approach leverages recent advances in the encoding of the ... [Show full abstract]  execution traces of interacting, concurrent threads. We assess the performance of our method on benchmarks drawn from embedded systems code and device drivers, and experimentally compare it to conventional formal approaches that use source-to-source transformations. Our experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to demonstrate effective formal verification of low-level embedded software with nested interrupts.

 System-Level Observation Framework for Non-Intrusive Runtime Monitoring of Embedded Systems

 Jong Chul Lee 
  Roman Lysecky 
  As the complexity of embedded systems rapidly increases, the use of traditional analysis and debug methods encounters significant challenges in monitoring, analyzing, and debugging the complex interactions of various software and hardware components. This situation is further exacerbated for in-situ debugging and verification in which traditional debug and trace interfaces that require physical ... [Show full abstract]  access are unavailable, infeasible, or cost prohibitive. In this article, we present a system-level observation framework that provides minimally intrusive methods for dynamically monitoring and analyzing deeply integrated hardware and software components within embedded systems. The system-level observation framework monitors hardware and software events by inserting additional logic for detecting designer-specified events within hardware cores to observe complex interaction across hardware and software boundaries at runtime, and provides visibility for monitoring complex execution behavior of software applications without affecting the system execution.

  Slicing is a program analysis technique, originally aimed at helping software engineers in program debugging. A slicing algorithm is intended to remove unnecessary statements, with respect to a criterion. Nowadays, slicing is becoming more important on the specification level, for model reduction. Our contribution consists of a dependence-based solution to the problem of slicing communicating ... [Show full abstract]  automata specifications, together with efficient algorithms to automatically extract slices. The resulting slicing tool - named CARVER - has shown to be operational in specification debugging and understanding. The model reduction results obtained with this tool are promising, notably in the area of formal validation and verification.

 S  TUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION flag   
 SRC OVERVIEW  
 The Student Research Competition (SRC) program was added to the ACM SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) in 2013. SAC 2025 SRC program provides graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of interest. Active students seeking feedback from the scientific community on their research ideas are invited to submit abstracts of their original unpublished and in-progress research work in areas of experimental computing and application development related to SAC 2025 Tracks. | This program is open for graduate students  currently enrolled in University or College and have active ACM and  SIGAPP student membership  . Abstracts must be authored by a single student  only. Faculty advisor(s) cannot be listed as co-authors on the submission or on the final poster presentation. No group projects are allowed. | Students are invited to submit research abstracts, of maximum 3 pages in ACM camera-ready format  , to the submission system. Abstracts must address original and unpublished research work related to a SAC track, with emphasis on the innovation behind the research idea. The submission should address the research problem being investigated, the proposed approach and research methodology, and sample preliminary results of the work. In addition, the abstract should reflect on the originality of the work, innovation of the approach, and applicability of the results to real-world problems | Submitting the same abstract to multiple SAC tracks is not allowed. The work must not be submitted to any another SRC program, journal or conference while it is under consideration for SAC 2025 SRC Program. | Student research abstracts must be submitted to their respective SAC tracks through the submission system. The abstracts are reviewed by reviewers who review paper submissions to that track. The Track Chairs (TCs) manage the review process. | Invited authors are eligible to apply for the SIGAPP's Student Travel Award Program (STAP) for funding to cover travel expenses such as Conference registration; Transportation expenses (air, rail, bus, taxi, car service, car rental, parking); Meals; Hotel rooms; Tips; Supplies for poster development; and Poster shipment, etc. | Participation requires conference registration at the student rate, using the registration type "SRC Student Author". | A judging panel will evaluate the poster displays and then the oral (PowerPoint) presentations during the second round of judging:  
  Round #1:  Judging all displayed posters to select the top five posters.  
  Round #2:  Judging the five presentations to select the top three winners for medals and cash prizes. | The top three winners will be notified by email after the conference. The cash prizes are paid directly by ACM after the conference (First place $500; Second place $300; and Third place $200). 
    
 Poster Preparation Guidelines (first round):  
 Authors of invited SRC submissions are required to print and bring their posters to the conference following these guidelines: | Poster materials should be displayed on a poster board (size: TBD) | including diagrams, graphs, data, pictures and text may be mounted. Thumbtacks and poster board will be provided for mounting materials. No audiovisual equipment is available. Poster authors may make preprints of their papers available to participants. 
  The poster content should be clearly divided into sections including introduction, problem definition, work summary, results, and conclusion. 
  The poster content (text and illustrations) should be readable from a distance of at least 5 feet. All illustrations should be properly titled. 
  A heading label including the title, author name(s), and the primary author(s) address should be included at the top of the poster board. 
    
 Power Point Preparation Guidelines (second round):  
 Total presentation time is 15 minutes. 
  Prepare Power Point slides for about 10 minutes presentation. 
  Allow Q/A session for 5 minutes.

 International Conference on   
  Selected Areas in Cryptography  
   
 Canada's research conference on cryptography since 1994   

 About SAC  
 The Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) series was initiated in 1994, when the first workshop was held at Queen's University in Kingston. The organizing committee for that first workshop consisted of Carlisle Adams, Henk Meijer, Stafford Tavares and Paul van Oorschot. From its original emphasis on block ciphers, SAC has evolved into a leading international conference in cryptography covering a range of topics in the field.  
 SAC has been held annually since 1994 in several Canadian provinces and is the only cryptography conference series that is held annually in Canada.  

 SAC 2024 – Montréal, Quebec – August 26–30, 2024  
 SAC 2024 recently took place in Montréal. Pre-proceedings are now available on the conference website.  
 SAC 2024 website    

 SAC 2025 – Toronto, Ontario – August 12–15, 2025  
 SAC 2025 will have two submission deadlines: January 27 and May 7.  
 The special selected topic will be machine learning and cryptography: applications of machine learning to cryptography and cryptanalysis, and application of cryptanalytic techniques against machine learning algorithms.  
 SAC 2025 website

 Welcome to SafeComp 2025!   
 The 44 th  International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security  

 Let’s explore new frontiers of safety critical computing systems!  
 The 44th edition of SafeComp provides a unique occasion to explore and debate challenges of safety critical computing systems. Safety is more relevant than ever, with expanding capabilities of (semi-) autonomous cyber-physical system (CPS), interacting with humans in various roles and acting in more open environments. The 2025 theme is that of “Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuum.”  
 SafeComp is an annual international conference covering the state-of-the-art, industrial experiences and new trends in the areas of safety, security and reliability of critical computer applications. SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference without parallel sessions, allowing easy networking.  
 Since it was established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), SafeComp has contributed to the progress of the state-of-the-art in dependable application of computers in safety-related and safety-critical systems.  
 Safety engineering has to carefully investigate the implications of the increasing complexity of software defined computing systems, as they are increasingly connected, interacting with supporting digital infrastructures, filled with AI and provided with more advanced perception systems.  
 Welcome to SafeComp 2025 in Stockholm, hosted by KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

 Call for Papers   

 Established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), SafeComp has contributed to the progress of the state-of-the-art in dependable application of computers in safety-related and safety-critical systems.  
 SafeComp is an annual event covering the state-of-the-art, experience and new trends in the areas of safety, security and reliability of critical computer applications. SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches, and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference allowing easy networking.  
 This 44th edition of SAFECOMP is a unique occasion to explore and debate hot topics of current challenges and solutions for future safety critical systems.  

 SafeComp 2025 Brochure      
 Theme  

 Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuumFuture societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges:  
 Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems 
  Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance 
  Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability 
  Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices 

 Paper Submission Guidelines  

 The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):  
 Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge; 
  Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners. 
  Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.  
 All paper submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS templates  provided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.

SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches, and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference allowing easy networking.  
 This 44th edition of SAFECOMP is a unique occasion to explore and debate hot topics of current challenges and solutions for future safety critical systems.  

 SafeComp 2025 Brochure      
 Theme  

 Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuumFuture societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges:  
 Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems 
  Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance 
  Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability 
  Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices 

 Paper Submission Guidelines  

 The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):  
 Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge; 
  Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners. 
  Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.  
 All paper submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS templates  provided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.

  Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability 
  Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices 

 Paper Submission Guidelines  

 The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):  
 Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge; 
  Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners. 
  Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.  
 All paper submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS templates  provided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.

 The ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies (SACMAT) is the premier forum for the presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of access control including models, systems, applications, and theory. The aims of the symposium are to share novel access control solutions that fulfill the needs of heterogeneous applications and environments, and to identify new directions for future research and development. SACMAT provides researchers and practitioners with a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of access control.    
 Call for Research Papers     
 Papers offering novel research contributions are solicited for submission. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and published by the ACM in the symposium proceedings. We also encourage submissions to the "   Work-in-progress Track    " to present ideas that may have not been completely developed and experimentally evaluated. In addition to the regular research track, this year SACMAT will again host the special track – "   Blue Sky/Vision Track    ". Researchers are invited to submit papers describing promising new ideas and challenges of interest to the community as well as access control needs emerging from other fields. We are particularly looking for potentially disruptive and new ideas which can shape the research agenda for the next 10 years.    
 Submission Cycles     
 ACM SACMAT 2024 Regular and Work-in-progress Tracks will have   one submission cycle    .    
 Paper Submission and Format     
 Regular Track Paper     
 Papers must be written in   English    . Authors are required to use the ACM format for papers, using the two-column SIG Proceedings Template (the sigconf template for LaTeX) available in the following link:   https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions       
 The length of the paper in the proceedings format must not exceed twelve US letter pages formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper and be no more than 5MB in size. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submission will print easily on simple default configurations. The submission   must be anonymous    , so information that might identify the authors - including author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious self-citations - must be excluded. It is the authors' responsibility to ensure that their anonymity is preserved when citing their own work. Submissions should be made by the paper submission deadline to the EasyChair conference management system (   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmsacmat2024      ).    
 All submissions must contain a significant original contribution. That is, submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal conference, or workshop. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same work is not allowed. Wherever appropriate, relevant related work, including that of the authors, must be cited. Submissions that are not accepted as full papers may be invited to appear as short papers. At least one author from each accepted paper must register (with a full registration) for the conference prior to the camera-ready deadline and is expected to (physically) present it at the conference (remote presentations are possible only as exceptional cases, e.g., last minute positive COVID).    
 Work-in-progress Track     
 Authors are invited to submit papers in the newly introduced work-in-progress track. This track is introduced for (junior) authors, ideally Ph.D. and Master's students, to obtain early, constructive feedback on their work. Submissions in this track should follow the same format as for the regular track papers while limiting the total number of pages to six US letter pages. Paper submitted in this track   should be anonymized    and can be submitted by the same deadline as for the regular track to the EasyChair conference management system (   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmsacmat2024      ).    
 Blue Sky Track     
 All submissions to this track should be in the same format as for the regular track, but the length must not exceed ten US letter pages and the submissions are not required to be anonymized (optional). Submissions to this track should be submitted by the same deadlines as the ones for the regular track to the EasyChair conference management system (   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmsacmat2024      ).    
 Other Calls     
 Call for Demos     
 A demonstration proposal should clearly describe (1) the overall architecture of the system or technology to be demonstrated, and (2) one or more demonstration scenarios that describe how the audience interacting with the demonstration system or the demonstrator, will gain an understanding of the underlying technology. Submissions will be evaluated based on the motivation of the work behind the use of the system or technology to be demonstrated and its novelty.    
 Demonstration proposals should be in the same format as for the regular track, but the length must not exceed four US letter pages, and the submission should not be anonymized. A two-page description of the demonstration will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions are expected to be submitted through the EasyChair conference management system (   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmsacmat2024      ) by the demo submission deadline.    
 Call for Posters     
 SACMAT 2024 will include a poster session to promote discussion of ongoing projects among researchers in the field of access control and computer security. Posters can cover preliminary or exploratory work with interesting ideas, or research projects in early stages with promising results in all aspects of access control and computer security. Authors interested in displaying a poster must submit a poster abstract in the same format as for the regular track, but the length must not exceed three US letter pages, and the submission should not be anonymized. Accepted poster abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings.    
 Submissions are expected to be submitted through the EasyChair conference management system (   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmsacmat2024      ) by the poster submission deadline.    
 Call for Lightning Talks     
 Participants are invited to submit proposals for 5-minute lightning talks describing recently published results, work in progress, wild ideas etc.    
 Submissions are expected to be submitted through the EasyChair conference management system (   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmsacmat2024      ) by the lightning talks submission deadline.

 Definition  
 For the purposes of this policy, competing interests are defined as financial and non-financial interests that could directly undermine, or be perceived to undermine the objectivity, integrity and value of a publication, through a potential influence on the judgements and actions of authors with regard to objective data presentation, analysis and interpretation.  
 Financial competing interests include any of the following:  
 Funding | : Research support (including salaries, equipment, supplies, and other expenses) by organizations that may gain or lose financially through this publication. A specific role for the funding provider in the conceptualization, design, data collection, analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript, should be disclosed. 
  Employment | : Recent (while engaged in the research project), present or anticipated employment by any organization that may gain or lose financially through this publication. 
  Personal financial interests | : Ownership or contractual interest in stocks or shares of companies that may gain or lose financially through publication; consultation fees or other forms of remuneration (including reimbursements for attending symposia) from organizations that may gain or lose financially; patents or patent applications (awarded or pending) filed by the authors or their institutions whose value may be affected by publication. For patents and patent applications, disclosure of the following information is requested: patent applicant (whether author or institution), name of inventor(s), application number, status of application, specific aspect of manuscript covered in patent application. | It is difficult to specify a threshold at which a financial interest become significant, but note that many US universities require faculty members to disclose interests exceeding $10,000 or 5% equity in a company. Any such figure is necessarily arbitrary, so we offer as one possible practical alternative guideline: "Any undeclared competing financial interests that could embarrass you were they to become publicly known after your work was published." | We do not consider diversified mutual funds or investment trusts to constitute a competing financial interest. Also, for employees in non-executive or leadership positions, we do not consider financial interest related to stocks or shares in their company to constitute a competing financial interest, as long as they are publishing under their company affiliation. 
  Non-financial competing interests | : Non-financial competing interests can take different forms, including personal or professional relations with organizations and individuals. We would encourage authors and PC members to declare any unpaid roles or relationships that might have a bearing on the publication process. Examples of non-financial competing interests include (but are not limited to): | Unpaid membership in a government or non-governmental organization 
  Unpaid membership in an advocacy or lobbying organization 
  Unpaid advisory position in a commercial organization 
  Writing or consulting for an educational company 
  Acting as an expert witness 
  Conference Code of Conduct and Etiquette  
 ACM SACMAT will follow the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the ACM Policy Against Harassment  and guide to Reporting Unacceptable Behavior  .  
 Notes for Authors  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.) | ACM SACMAT 2024: ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies

 WELCOME   

 The Organizing Committee has the pleasure of inviting you to participate in the 12th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes, to take place in Ferrara, Italy, 4 - 7 June 2024, under the auspices of IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control.   
 The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is organized every three years, and for the first time from its first edition in 1991, it takes place in Italy. Therefore, SAFEPROCESS 2024 is continuing the successful series of IFAC symposia held in Baden Baden (Germany, 1991), Espoo (Finland, 1994), Hull (United Kingdom, 1997), Budapest (Hungary, 2000), Washington (United States, 2003), Beijing (China, 2006), Barcelona (Spain, 2009), Mexico City (Mexico, 2012), Paris (France, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2018), Pafos (Cyprus, 2022).   
 The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is a major international gathering of leading experts in the academia and industry from all over the worlds. It aims at strengthening the contact between the academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations.   

 The IFAC Safeprocess 2024 will provide the live streaming of technical sessions, roundtables and keynote lectures. However, live interaction is not supported.   

 Scope  : IFAC SAFEPROCESS is a major international gathering of leading experts in academia and industry. It aims at strengthening contacts between academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations. High-level speakers will present the global spectrum of fault diagnosis, process supervision and safety monitoring, state-of-the-art applications, and emerging research directions. The symposium is also meant as a forum for young scientists from all over the world, with the opportunity to introduce their research projects and works to an audience of international experts, young researchers, academics, and students. Fault diagnosis, Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) and Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) build a major area of research at the intersection of systems and control engineering, artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and statistics, and application fields like chemical, electrical, mechanical, aerospace engineering and transportation systems. IFAC has recognized the significance of this area by launching a  
  triennial symposium series dedicated to these subjects. SAFEPROCESS 2024 is continuing the successful series of symposia.    The IFAC SAFEPROCESS 2024 edition will be focused on major topics, i.e., energy, cybersecurity, water systems, and autonomous vehicles  . Special sessions, plenary lectures, tutorials, benchmarks, and roundtables will highlight industrial-academic projects, challenges, and applications.   

  Topics & Application Areas   

 The continuous increase in the complexity of modern industrial systems and objects as well as growing reliability demands regarding their operation and control quality are serious challenges for further development of the theory and practice of control and technical diagnostics. Early detection of faults is   
 critical in avoiding performance degradation and damage to machinery or human life.   
 During the SAFEPROCESS Symposium high-level speakers will give talks on a wide spectrum of topics related to fault diagnosis, process supervision, safety monitoring, sustainable, health aware and fault-tolerant control as well as state-of-the-art applications and emerging research directions.     
 The symposium is also meant as a forum for young researchers, with the opportunity to present their scientific ambitions and work to an audience of international communities of technical diagnostics and control.   
 Fault diagnosis, sustainable, health aware and fault-tolerant control have developed into a major research area at the intersection of system and control engineering, applied mathematics and statistics or soft computing as well as application fields such as civil, mechanical, electrical, chemical, computer science, telecommunication, and aerospace engineering. IFAC is recognized as playing a crucial role in this aspect by launching a triennial symposium dedicated to these subjects.

 The full text of all papers presented in person (no virtual presentations) at the symposium will be published, after the symposium, on the IFAC PaperCept Online website (  http://ifac.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl    ). The best papers will be recommended for publication in various IFAC journals.   

 Invited session proposals    should be anticipated by email to the Invited Session IPC Chair N. Eva Wu (evawu@binghamton.edu) by November 15, 2023. The proposal should include the title of the session, name, affiliation and address of the organizer, a summary of the session topic, and possibly a list of the invited papers with authors and titles. Invited session proposals must be submitted via the PaperCept website, where a session identification code will be assigned.   

 Contributors to the invited sessions must submit their full draft papers by November 25, 2023 deadline, specifying the invited session code to which they belong.   

 Tutorial session proposals must be sent to the Tutorial Session IPC Chair M. Bonfè   
 (marcello.bonfe@unife.it) by March 1, 2024. A tutorial session should be designed to help the attendees to become familiar with and learn something specific about chosen topics. The specific topic of the tutorial, its objectives, and the background required by the attendees should be clearly identified at the outset. Where appropriate, references for obtaining the background should be provided. The objective of citations in the tutorial sessions should be to provide the attendees with references where concepts can be studied more deeply. A set of selected references should be finally summarised. Tutorial proposals should include the title of the session, name, affiliation and address of the organizer, a summary of the session topics, and a list of the invited speakers (if required) with affiliations, and a preliminary schedule. Titles and abstracts of the talks should be also provided. Tutorial sessions should me no more than 4 – 6 hours. Upon receipt of the proposals, an identification number will be assigned.    Student registration entitles the participation to tutorial sessions  . Tutorial sessions will be delivered the day before the   
 symposium schedule, i.e. June 4, 2024.   

 Roundtable proposals    should be sent to the IPC Chair C. Verde Rodarte (verde@unam.mx) and the General Symposium Chair S. Simani (silvio.simani@unife.it) by    March 1  , 2024  . The general purpose of a roundtable is to hold a close discussion and exploration of a specific topic.    The IFAC SAFEPROCESS 2024 edition will be focused on major topics, i.e., energy, cybersecurity, water systems, and autonomous vehicles  . Roundtables should be comprised of experts on specific topics, and the organisers of roundtables should include a list of several goals to focus on. The overall objective of roundtables should be to produce a final set of recommendations and driving directions to an emerging topic. The novelty and advantage of roundtables is the live interaction of the experts/panellists and the audience. Dialogue and feedback from the audience and panellists on relevant topics will be enabled using apps and digital tools. The submission of a roundtable proposal should include the title, name, affiliation and address of the organizers, a summary of the addressed topics, and a list of the invited panellists, with affiliations, a preliminary   schedule. Each roundtable should be of no more than 2 hours. Roundtable sessions will be scheduled during the technical sessions of the symposium dates, i.e., June 5 – 7, 2024.   

 LiU-ICE Industrial Fault Diagnosis Benchmark Competition  : A common challenge of designing diagnosis systems in industrial applications, is limited data availability from relevant fault scenarios and a lack of knowledge of model uncertainty. Development of fault diagnosis design techniques in this situation is the theme of the competition. The case study is the air-flow of an internal combustion engine. Information for competition participants can be found on the benchmark homepage:   
 https://vehsys.gitlab-pages.liu.se/diagnostic_competition/   

 The submission deadline is April 21, 2024  . The benchmark and the competition has been provided by Daniel Jung, Erik Frisk, and Mattias Krysander ({daniel.jung, erik.frisk, mattias.krysander}@liu.se) from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University, Sweden.

 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sagt2024    
  
 The submission deadline  has been extended:  
 Abstract submission deadline: May 22, 2024, 23:59 AoE   
 Full paper submission deadline: May 26, 2024, 23:59 AoE   
  
 NOTE:  An empty paper is sufficient to register the paper before the abstract submission deadline. However, a full abstract is required and only minor changes will be allowed to that before the full paper deadline. Only papers that have been registered before the abstract submission deadline will be considered.  
  
 The expectation is that at least one of the authors of each accepted paper will attend SAGT and give a presentation for the work. However, we are open to consider the possibility of remote talks in exceptional circumstances (due to, e.g., visa/travel issues) provided that at least one author has registered to the conference.  

 Submission Format   
 Submissions may be up to 18 pages long (excluding title page and references) in single-column format, using at least 11-point fonts, single-spacing between lines, and at least 1-inch margins all around. In addition, an appendix may be included at the end of the paper and will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines may be rejected without review. Please note that, as for all previous editions, SAGT 2024 implements a single-blind peer-review process.  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to structure their paper in a way that includes a clear presentation of the merits of the paper and a discussion of the importance of the results, as well as an exposition of the key conceptual and technical ideas.  
 The symposium proceedings will be published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) proceedings volume in the ARCoSS subline. Accepted papers will be allocated at most 18 pages (including title page and references) in LNCS format in the proceedings. Please note that the LNCS format has much wider page margins. We recommend that authors use the LNCS format (provided as part of Springer's LaTeX2e package  ) to prepare their submission, but this is not a requirement for the submission. Please refer to Springer's Information for Authors  for detailed guidelines on how to prepare the final manuscript.  
 To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can choose to publish a one-page abstract of their paper in the proceedings. The paper must then provide a URL referring to the full version of the paper; authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. Such papers must be formatted and submitted just like regular papers (as described above).  
 Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to SAGT, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline, will not be considered for publication as regular papers. Simultaneous submission of regular papers to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed. Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in SAGT 2024.  

 Best Paper Award   
 There will be a SAGT 2024 Best Paper Award, accompanied by a prize of 1000 Euro offered by Springer.

  Ambiguous Contracts  
   
   Contract theory captures situations where two parties—a principal and an agent— can benefit from mutual cooperation. The prototypical situation is one in which the principal seeks to delegate the execution of a job to an agent. The agent can take different costly actions, and his choice of action entails a stochastic outcome (with attached reward) for the principal. The principal cannot directly observe the agent’s choice of action but can influence the agent’s decision through a contract that specifies outcome-contingent payments. Given a contract, the agent aims to maximize his expected payment minus cost. The goal of the principal is to maximize her expected utility given by expected reward minus payment, under the action chosen by the agent.  
  One feature of real-life contracts that is not captured (or explained) by this classic model is that practical contracts are often ambiguous. For example, the promotion guidelines of a university may require a candidate to demonstrate “research productivity and excellence.” Similarly, a professional services contract may require that a provider exert “due diligence.” This ambiguity may be due to an inability of the two parties to provide more precise specification. In contrast, we explore the deliberate infusion of ambiguity as a tool to enhance the principal’s contracting power over the agent.  
  Towards this goal we propose an extension of the classic (hidden action) principal-agent model. In this model, an ambiguous contract consists of a set of classic contracts, which the agent evaluates by considering the minimum utility a given action yields against any contract in the support of the ambiguous contract. At the same time, we require that the principal’s utility—under the action chosen by the agent—is the same for all contracts in the support of the ambiguous contract. We show that this expands the set of actions that the principal can implement, and that the principal’s gain from using an ambiguous contract can be arbitrarily large. We further characterize the structure of optimal ambiguous contracts, showing that ambiguity drives optimal contracts towards simplicity. We also provide a characterization of ambiguity-proof classes of contracts, where the principal cannot gain by infusing ambiguity. Finally, we show that when the agent can engage in mixed actions, the advantages of ambiguous contracts disappear.

  Learning-Augmented Mechanism Design   
   
  For more than half a century, the dominant approach for the mathematical analysis of algorithms in computer science has been worst-case analysis. While worst-case analysis provides a useful signal regarding the robustness of an algorithm, it can be overly pessimistic, and it often leads to uninformative bounds or impossibility results that may not reflect real-world obstacles. Meanwhile, advances in machine learning have led to very practical algorithms, most of which do not provide any non-trivial worst-case performance guarantees. Motivated by the tension between worst-case analysis and machine learning, a surge of recent work focuses on the design algorithms that are guided by machine-learned predictions, aiming to perform better in practice, while maintaining their robustness. Specifically, the goal of this literature on “learning-augmented algorithms” is to design algorithms that simultaneously provide two types of guarantees: “robustness” (which corresponds to the classic worst-case guarantees, even if the predictions that the algorithm is provided with are arbitrarily bad) and “consistency” (i.e., stronger performance guarantees when the predictions are accurate). This “learning-augmented framework” has been used successfully in a variety of settings, e.g., toward a refined analysis of competitive ratios in online algorithms and running times in traditional algorithms.  
   
  A recent line of work on “learning-augmented mechanism design” has deployed this learning augmented framework in settings involving strategic agents. In such settings, the designer often faces additional obstacles which further limit their ability to reach desired outcomes. For example, some of the input that the designer needs may be private information held by the participating agents, and the agents could strategically misreport this information, aiming to maximize their own utility. In other settings, the agents may even have direct control over some aspects of the outcome. The long literature on mechanism design has proposed a variety of solutions for these types of problems, aiming to align the incentives of the agents with those of the designer, but the worst-case guarantees of these solutions are often underwhelming from a practical perspective. This talk will introduce the “learning-augmented mechanism design” model and provide an overview of some of the results in this line of work.

  Actually, Data is a Rival Good   
   
  There is a tendency in many fields, including computer science, economics, and industry, to model data as a non-rival good, meaning that one entity using a particular piece of data doesn’t impinge on its use by others. Food is a classic rival good (if I eat the apple, you cannot); digital music is a classic non-rival good (my listening to the song has no effect on your listening experience). Data might, at first blush, seem more like digital music than like an apple. In this talk, I will give arguments from three fields—economics, privacy, and statistics—for why modeling data as non-rival is problematic, and will argue that we need a new paradigm.  
  The core of the economic argument is that generative AI has transformed the market for data, making competition (and rivalrousness) for and around data newly central. The privacy and statistical validity arguments rely on mathematical frameworks that help us understand how repeated uses of a dataset accumulate and interact. All of these arguments suggest new models and metaphors for data, and directions for further work.

  Proportionality in Multi-Winner Voting: Axioms, Voting Rules and Equilibria  
    
  Voting is one of the oldest and most studied forms of collective decision making. In this tutorial, I will focus on a specific form of voting, namely multi-winner voting, where a set of voters must elect a committee of k candidates out of a larger set of available alternatives. One of the central requirements in multi-winner voting is that the chosen committee represents the electorate’s preferences in a proportional manner. While proportionality is well understood in traditional parliamentary elections, it is not immediately clear what it means without a rigid party structure. However, recent advances in computational social choice theory have allowed us to develop a new and deeper understanding of fairness and proportionality in multi-winner voting, even without explicitly defined parties.  
   
  In the first part of the tutorial I will give an introduction to this recent literature on proportionality in multi-winner voting, presenting some axioms that have developed to formally capture the intuitive idea of proportionality, examine some voting rules designed to provide proportional committees, and look at some computational aspects of finding fair committees. In the second part of the tutorial, I will link multi-winner voting with game theory by showing that many of the axioms and rules touched on in the first part can be understood in terms of equilibria in normal-form games or in markets for public goods. To conclude, I will discuss important open questions in multi-winner voting and how methods from (algorithmic) game theory might be used to answer them.

  Prophet Inequalities with Limited Information  
   
   Many applications require assigning resources in an online fashion: decisions on incoming bids have to be made immediately, and before seeing all n bids in the sequence.  
  A fundamental hardness inherent to this setting limits online strategies to perform no better than the one that simply picks a random winner for each good, so additional assumptions are needed. Famously, in prophet inequalities, one assumes access to all n (independent) distributions that the participant’s bids will be drawn from, achieving exp. competitive guarantees of up to half the expected offline optimum.  
   
  Recently, considerable interest has been drawn to the fact that full prior distributional knowledge is in general not actually necessary to circumvent the impossibility.  
  Instead, one can often achieve similar (or even equally good) approximations with access to just a few samples from each distribution. This data-driven approach poses a clear advantage in practical settings, where full distributions are rarely available (but one might, for example, know the bids the same participant placed in a few previous auctions).  
   
  The tutorial gives an overview of such results, with a focus on the edge case of ‘minimal’ prior knowledge, i.e. the online algorithm only has access to one single sample from each distribution. We first derive how and why constant ratios can be obtained for simple settings, and then show how the same principle surprisingly generalizes up to very recent results on XOS combinatorial assignments. Then, we consider the design of truthful mechanisms, a central goal whenever agents might bid strategically, and discuss the existing results as well as known obstacles to extending them.

 Nuit Blanche à Montréal  

 Polytechnique Montréal  

 Conference Venue  

 SANER 2025  
   
 The IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER) is the premier event on the theory and practice of recovering information from existing software and systems. The event explores innovative methods to extract the many kinds of information that can be recovered from software, software engineering documents, and systems artifacts, and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding.  
 SANER promotes discussion and interaction among researchers and practitioners about the development of maintainable systems, and the improvement, evolution, migration, and reengineering of existing systems. The venue also explores innovative methods of extraction for the many kinds of information of interest to software developers and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding.  
 SANER will feature technical research paper sessions, workshops, an early research achievements track, an industry paper track, a tool demonstration track, and a dedicated track on negative results in software analysis, evolution and reengineering.  
 Why you should come to Montreal    
 Montreal is Canada’s cultural capital, a bilingual metropolis where the charm of Europe melds with the innovation of North America. It is the country’s second-largest urban centre, with a population of 4.1 million. Forbes named it the world’s tenth-cleanest city in 2007. Montreal is a melting pot of over 200 cultures, as reflected in its diverse culinary landscape. It is an academic hub and home to six major universities and their affiliated schools. Montreal’s reputation for blending a safe and vibrant environment with rich cultural experiences earned it the title of the best student city in the world by QS in 2017, attracting approximately 50,000 international students each year and positioning itself at the forefront of innovation and education.  
 Winter in Montreal transforms the city into a snowy playground, offering a multitude of vibrant activities. The season is perfect for gliding across the picturesque Bonsecours Basin ice skating rink or taking a festive stroll through the Montreal en Lumière festival  , where light installations, live performances, and culinary delights dazzle the senses. For the adventurous, the nearby Mont Royal has become a haven for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, offering panoramic views of the city blanketed in white. Not to be missed is the city’s renowned underground city, a warm respite from the chill, lined with shops and art displays. In March of every year, the city comes alive during Nuit Blanche  , an all-night celebration of culture and arts, where galleries, theatres, and public spaces host an array of activities, performances, and interactive experiences that captivate residents and visitors alike.  
 For those attending the SANER 2025 conference, Montreal offers more than academic fulfillment; it provides a tapestry of experiences that intertwine with the city’s lifestyle. With a plethora of festivals, a vibrant underground city, world-class museums, bustling markets, exquisite culinary delights, colourful street art, diverse architecture, a rich tapestry of languages, and a thriving craft beer culture, it’s a place that fully engages all your senses.

 Research Papers   
 The Research Track of the 32nd edition of the IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025) invites high-quality submissions of papers describing original and unpublished research results. We encourage submissions describing various types of research, e.g., empirical, theoretical, and tool-oriented. The topics of the submissions should be of direct interest to the software analysis, evolution, and reengineering community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 -AI for Software Engineering;  
 -Software Engineering for AI;  
 -Generative AI and LLM;  
 -Software Tools for Software Evolution and Maintenance;  
 -Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction;  
 -Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering;  
 -Program Comprehension;  
 -Software Evolution Analysis;  
 -Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting;  
 -Program Transformation and Refactoring;  
 -Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics;  
 -Software Visualization;  
 -Software Reconstruction and Migration;  
 -Software Maintenance and Evolution;  
 -Program Repair;  
 -Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery;  
 -Empirical studies on all the above topics;  
 -Education related to all of the above topics;  
 -Legal aspects.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of selected research papers accepted at SANER 2025 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue featured by Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering Journal (EMSE)  . The best papers from the conference will be awarded. More details on this matter will be shared soon.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Research papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 - Soundness  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods;  
 - Significance  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are important with respect to open software engineering challenges;  
 - Novelty  : The extent to which the contribution is sufficiently original and is clearly explained with respect to the state-of-the-art;  
 - Verifiability  : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions;  
 - Presentation  : The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the standards of SANER, including clear descriptions and explanations, appropriate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc or compsocconf option. IEEE paper templates can be accessed from their official location  . Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. All submissions must be in English. All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025  . Submissions should not exceed 12 pages  (the last 2 pages for references only) and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.  
 Important note  : SANER 2025 follows a full double-anonymous review process. To be compliant with the double-anonymous policy, submitted papers must adhere to the following rules (largely reused from ASE 2017 double-anonymous instructions):  
 -Author names and affiliations must be omitted;  
 -References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not We build on our previous work… but rather We build on the work of…);  
 -There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow-up of one of your previous works, and despite what was recommended in the previous point, reviewers will associate authorship of such a previous work with the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: based on previous results [10] .. where the reference is reported as [10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted per double-blind reviewing. In doing so, however, please make sure that the SANER 2025 submission is self-contained and that its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper;  
 -Do not include acknowledgments of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgments in the camera-ready version;  
 -If you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead;  
 -Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course”. You can of course add the institutional information to the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply to work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may refer to the organization as Org or Company. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, videogame development company, etc.);  
 -Avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Whenever possible, please use the EasyChair additional material field to submit a .zip or .tgz file including additional material. This is of course possible for small attachments. In other cases, you may post anonymized links (with a warning that the following link may reveal authors’ identities), including links to anonymized code or deployments. When creating such repositories, a good practice can be asking somebody in your team to test the anonymization of the repository and its content. If the anonymization is difficult to achieve and you still want to provide the availability of data/tools, you can simply state that you will link to the code or deployment in the camera-ready version. Program committee members are asked to keep into account the double-blind policy when reviewing papers, and therefore not require full availability of artifacts at submission time.  
 -SANER 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors, we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and cite it. Please consider using Zenodo  , Figshare  , or other services that provide DOIs and allow anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org  is recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These datasets, anonymized through Zenodo and other services, should be linked within the paper itself. Instructions for double-blind friendly uploading of datasets are available here: https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance.html  .  
 -To submit your paper, please use the same submission link. After clicking on “Make a New Submission,” you will be presented with a list of all available tracks. Be sure to select the correct track (e.g., Short Papers and Posters Track), as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Research Papers   
 The Research Track of the 32nd edition of the IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025) invites high-quality submissions of papers describing original and unpublished research results. We encourage submissions describing various types of research, e.g., empirical, theoretical, and tool-oriented. The topics of the submissions should be of direct interest to the software analysis, evolution, and reengineering community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 -AI for Software Engineering;  
 -Software Engineering for AI;  
 -Generative AI and LLM;  
 -Software Tools for Software Evolution and Maintenance;  
 -Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction;  
 -Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering;  
 -Program Comprehension;  
 -Software Evolution Analysis;  
 -Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting;  
 -Program Transformation and Refactoring;  
 -Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics;  
 -Software Visualization;  
 -Software Reconstruction and Migration;  
 -Software Maintenance and Evolution;  
 -Program Repair;  
 -Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery;  
 -Empirical studies on all the above topics;  
 -Education related to all of the above topics;  
 -Legal aspects.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of selected research papers accepted at SANER 2025 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue featured by Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering Journal (EMSE)  . The best papers from the conference will be awarded. More details on this matter will be shared soon.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Research papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 - Soundness  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods;  
 - Significance  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are important with respect to open software engineering challenges;  
 - Novelty  : The extent to which the contribution is sufficiently original and is clearly explained with respect to the state-of-the-art;  
 - Verifiability  : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions;  
 - Presentation  : The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the standards of SANER, including clear descriptions and explanations, appropriate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc or compsocconf option. IEEE paper templates can be accessed from their official location  . Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. All submissions must be in English. All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025  . Submissions should not exceed 12 pages  (the last 2 pages for references only) and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.  
 Important note  : SANER 2025 follows a full double-anonymous review process. To be compliant with the double-anonymous policy, submitted papers must adhere to the following rules (largely reused from ASE 2017 double-anonymous instructions):  
 -Author names and affiliations must be omitted;  
 -References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not We build on our previous work… but rather We build on the work of…);  
 -There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow-up of one of your previous works, and despite what was recommended in the previous point, reviewers will associate authorship of such a previous work with the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: based on previous results [10] .. where the reference is reported as [10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted per double-blind reviewing. In doing so, however, please make sure that the SANER 2025 submission is self-contained and that its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper;  
 -Do not include acknowledgments of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgments in the camera-ready version;  
 -If you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead;  
 -Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course”. You can of course add the institutional information to the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply to work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may refer to the organization as Org or Company. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, videogame development company, etc.);  
 -Avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Whenever possible, please use the EasyChair additional material field to submit a .zip or .tgz file including additional material. This is of course possible for small attachments. In other cases, you may post anonymized links (with a warning that the following link may reveal authors’ identities), including links to anonymized code or deployments. When creating such repositories, a good practice can be asking somebody in your team to test the anonymization of the repository and its content. If the anonymization is difficult to achieve and you still want to provide the availability of data/tools, you can simply state that you will link to the code or deployment in the camera-ready version. Program committee members are asked to keep into account the double-blind policy when reviewing papers, and therefore not require full availability of artifacts at submission time.  
 -SANER 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors, we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and cite it. Please consider using Zenodo  , Figshare  , or other services that provide DOIs and allow anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org  is recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These datasets, anonymized through Zenodo and other services, should be linked within the paper itself. Instructions for double-blind friendly uploading of datasets are available here: https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance.html  .  
 -To submit your paper, please use the same submission link. After clicking on “Make a New Submission,” you will be presented with a list of all available tracks. Be sure to select the correct track (e.g., Short Papers and Posters Track), as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

 Research papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 - Soundness  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods;  
 - Significance  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are important with respect to open software engineering challenges;  
 - Novelty  : The extent to which the contribution is sufficiently original and is clearly explained with respect to the state-of-the-art;  
 - Verifiability  : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions;  
 - Presentation  : The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the standards of SANER, including clear descriptions and explanations, appropriate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc or compsocconf option. IEEE paper templates can be accessed from their official location  . Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. All submissions must be in English. All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025  . Submissions should not exceed 12 pages  (the last 2 pages for references only) and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.  
 Important note  : SANER 2025 follows a full double-anonymous review process. To be compliant with the double-anonymous policy, submitted papers must adhere to the following rules (largely reused from ASE 2017 double-anonymous instructions):  
 -Author names and affiliations must be omitted;  
 -References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not We build on our previous work… but rather We build on the work of…);  
 -There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow-up of one of your previous works, and despite what was recommended in the previous point, reviewers will associate authorship of such a previous work with the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: based on previous results [10] .. where the reference is reported as [10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted per double-blind reviewing. In doing so, however, please make sure that the SANER 2025 submission is self-contained and that its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper;  
 -Do not include acknowledgments of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgments in the camera-ready version;  
 -If you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead;  
 -Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course”. You can of course add the institutional information to the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply to work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may refer to the organization as Org or Company. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, videogame development company, etc.);  
 -Avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Whenever possible, please use the EasyChair additional material field to submit a .zip or .tgz file including additional material. This is of course possible for small attachments. In other cases, you may post anonymized links (with a warning that the following link may reveal authors’ identities), including links to anonymized code or deployments. When creating such repositories, a good practice can be asking somebody in your team to test the anonymization of the repository and its content. If the anonymization is difficult to achieve and you still want to provide the availability of data/tools, you can simply state that you will link to the code or deployment in the camera-ready version. Program committee members are asked to keep into account the double-blind policy when reviewing papers, and therefore not require full availability of artifacts at submission time.  
 -SANER 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors, we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and cite it. Please consider using Zenodo  , Figshare  , or other services that provide DOIs and allow anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org  is recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These datasets, anonymized through Zenodo and other services, should be linked within the paper itself. Instructions for double-blind friendly uploading of datasets are available here: https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance.html  .  
 -To submit your paper, please use the same submission link. After clicking on “Make a New Submission,” you will be presented with a list of all available tracks. Be sure to select the correct track (e.g., Short Papers and Posters Track), as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

 ERA@SANER 2025 Call for Papers   
 Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER) is an ever-evolving field, and the community is always prolific in new disruptive ideas, and possibilities of synergies between research and practice. The Early Research Achievements (ERA) track is the right place to share initial ideas that are not fully developed in terms of solutions or empirical evaluation as well as ground-breaking results that still need full validation. By collecting feedback from the SANER attendees, the authors can develop ground-breaking work.  
 The ERA track is also the right place to share novel, visionary, disruptive, and thought-provoking ideas that can trigger discussion at the conference and contribute to new research roadmaps.  
 ERA 2025 publishes the following two types of papers and highly welcomes submissions with forward-looking and innovative ideas  
 Research Preview (max 5 pages plus one page for reference):  provide a novel research idea that is not fully developed in terms of solutions or empirical evaluation or ground-breaking results that may still need full validation. A research preview should include research questions, envisioned methodology, a proof-of-concept or preliminary evaluation, a research plan, and potential risks and limitations. 
  Vision (max 5 pages plus one page for reference):  provide novel visionary, disruptive, and thought-provoking ideas to trigger discussion at the conference, potentially creating a paradigm-shift in SANER and novel long-term objectives. Vision paper can also raise awareness of novel and unexplored topics that are relevant to SANER. 
  Review Criteria:  We have different review criteria that the authors should consider when preparing their submissions, which will be taken into account by the PC members when reviewing these papers. Each paper type has its own review criteria, presented in order of relevance.  
 Research Preview   
 Novelty:  is the proposal sufficiently novel with respect to the state-of-the-art? Do the authors discuss related work and clearly identify the gaps their contribution aims to fill? 
  Soundness of the Research Plan:  do the authors present a convincing research plan? Did the authors discuss the limitations and risks of their plan? Is the plan referring to sound research methods? Do the authors clarify their research questions, planned data collection, and data analysis? Did the authors perform a convincing proof-of-concept or some preliminary research steps? 
  Potential for Discussion:  will the preview presentation raise the interest of the SANER audience? Will the preview lead to a good discussion? Will the audience be able to provide useful feedback to the authors, given the typical background of the SANER audience? Can the preview raise controversial opinions in the audience? 
  Presentation:  is the paper clearly presented? To what extent can the content of the paper be understood by the general SANER public? 
  Vision   
 Novelty:  is the main idea of the vision sufficiently surprising, thought-provoking, or visionary? To what extent is the main idea exciting for a reader? 
  Ambition of the Idea:  is the scope of the idea sufficiently broad to change the state of SANER or one of its sub-fields (e.g., AI & SE, LLM & SE)? To what extent does the idea create synergies with other disciplines? Do the authors sketch a convincing and visionary roadmap for research? Will other authors embrace the vision? 
  Potential for Discussion:  is the idea sufficiently thought-provoking? Will the presentation of the idea raise the interest of the SANER audience? Will the idea raise discussion? Will the audience be able to provide useful feedback to the authors, given the typical background of the SANER audience? Can the idea raise controversial opinions in the audience? 
  Presentation:  is the paper clearly presented? To what extent can the content of the paper be understood by the general SANER audience? 
  Submission Instructions   
 All authors who intend to submit a paper must first submit the title, abstract (max. 200 words), and author information. Abstracts are used only to point out your interest in submitting a paper and to allow the track co-chairs to match with the committee members early in time.  
 An abstract submission must be followed by a full paper submission.  
 Papers must describe original work that has not been previously published or submitted elsewhere. Papers must have between 4 and 5 pages, with an additional page for references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the IEEE formatting instructions. Submissions must be double-blinded in conformance with the instructions described in the research track. Submissions that do not respect these constraints will be rejected without review.  
 Accepted papers may require editing for clarity prior to publication and presentation. They will appear in the IEEE Digital Library.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register to and attend the conference in order to present their paper.  
 For further information and Word/Latex templates, please check the main call for papers.  
 To submit your paper, please use the same submission link. After clicking on “Make a New Submission,” you will be presented with a list of all available tracks. Be sure to select the correct track (e.g., Short Papers and Posters Track), as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Research Papers   
 The Research Track of the 32nd edition of the IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025) invites high-quality submissions of papers describing original and unpublished research results. We encourage submissions describing various types of research, e.g., empirical, theoretical, and tool-oriented. The topics of the submissions should be of direct interest to the software analysis, evolution, and reengineering community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 -AI for Software Engineering;  
 -Software Engineering for AI;  
 -Generative AI and LLM;  
 -Software Tools for Software Evolution and Maintenance;  
 -Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction;  
 -Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering;  
 -Program Comprehension;  
 -Software Evolution Analysis;  
 -Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting;  
 -Program Transformation and Refactoring;  
 -Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics;  
 -Software Visualization;  
 -Software Reconstruction and Migration;  
 -Software Maintenance and Evolution;  
 -Program Repair;  
 -Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery;  
 -Empirical studies on all the above topics;  
 -Education related to all of the above topics;  
 -Legal aspects.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of selected research papers accepted at SANER 2025 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue featured by Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering Journal (EMSE)  . The best papers from the conference will be awarded. More details on this matter will be shared soon.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Research papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 - Soundness  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods;  
 - Significance  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are important with respect to open software engineering challenges;  
 - Novelty  : The extent to which the contribution is sufficiently original and is clearly explained with respect to the state-of-the-art;  
 - Verifiability  : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions;  
 - Presentation  : The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the standards of SANER, including clear descriptions and explanations, appropriate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc or compsocconf option. IEEE paper templates can be accessed from their official location  . Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. All submissions must be in English. All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025  . Submissions should not exceed 12 pages  (the last 2 pages for references only) and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.  
 Important note  : SANER 2025 follows a full double-anonymous review process. To be compliant with the double-anonymous policy, submitted papers must adhere to the following rules (largely reused from ASE 2017 double-anonymous instructions):  
 -Author names and affiliations must be omitted;  
 -References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not We build on our previous work… but rather We build on the work of…);  
 -There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow-up of one of your previous works, and despite what was recommended in the previous point, reviewers will associate authorship of such a previous work with the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: based on previous results [10] .. where the reference is reported as [10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted per double-blind reviewing. In doing so, however, please make sure that the SANER 2025 submission is self-contained and that its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper;  
 -Do not include acknowledgments of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgments in the camera-ready version;  
 -If you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead;  
 -Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course”. You can of course add the institutional information to the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply to work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may refer to the organization as Org or Company. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, videogame development company, etc.);  
 -Avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Whenever possible, please use the EasyChair additional material field to submit a .zip or .tgz file including additional material. This is of course possible for small attachments. In other cases, you may post anonymized links (with a warning that the following link may reveal authors’ identities), including links to anonymized code or deployments. When creating such repositories, a good practice can be asking somebody in your team to test the anonymization of the repository and its content. If the anonymization is difficult to achieve and you still want to provide the availability of data/tools, you can simply state that you will link to the code or deployment in the camera-ready version. Program committee members are asked to keep into account the double-blind policy when reviewing papers, and therefore not require full availability of artifacts at submission time.  
 -SANER 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors, we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and cite it. Please consider using Zenodo  , Figshare  , or other services that provide DOIs and allow anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org  is recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These datasets, anonymized through Zenodo and other services, should be linked within the paper itself. Instructions for double-blind friendly uploading of datasets are available here: https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance.html  .  
 -To submit your paper, please use the same submission link. After clicking on “Make a New Submission,” you will be presented with a list of all available tracks. Be sure to select the correct track (e.g., Short Papers and Posters Track), as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Research Papers   
 The Research Track of the 32nd edition of the IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025) invites high-quality submissions of papers describing original and unpublished research results. We encourage submissions describing various types of research, e.g., empirical, theoretical, and tool-oriented. The topics of the submissions should be of direct interest to the software analysis, evolution, and reengineering community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 -AI for Software Engineering;  
 -Software Engineering for AI;  
 -Generative AI and LLM;  
 -Software Tools for Software Evolution and Maintenance;  
 -Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction;  
 -Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering;  
 -Program Comprehension;  
 -Software Evolution Analysis;  
 -Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting;  
 -Program Transformation and Refactoring;  
 -Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics;  
 -Software Visualization;  
 -Software Reconstruction and Migration;  
 -Software Maintenance and Evolution;  
 -Program Repair;  
 -Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery;  
 -Empirical studies on all the above topics;  
 -Education related to all of the above topics;  
 -Legal aspects.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of selected research papers accepted at SANER 2025 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue featured by Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering Journal (EMSE)  . The best papers from the conference will be awarded. More details on this matter will be shared soon.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Research papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 - Soundness  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods;  
 - Significance  : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are important with respect to open software engineering challenges;  
 - Novelty  : The extent to which the contribution is sufficiently original and is clearly explained with respect to the state-of-the-art;  
 - Verifiability  : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions;  
 - Presentation  : The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the standards of SANER, including clear descriptions and explanations, appropriate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc or compsocconf option. IEEE paper templates can be accessed from their official location  . Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. All submissions must be in English. All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025  . Submissions should not exceed 12 pages  (the last 2 pages for references only) and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.  
 Important note  : SANER 2025 follows a full double-anonymous review process. To be compliant with the double-anonymous policy, submitted papers must adhere to the following rules (largely reused from ASE 2017 double-anonymous instructions):  
 -Author names and affiliations must be omitted;  
 -References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not We build on our previous work… but rather We build on the work of…);  
 -There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow-up of one of your previous works, and despite what was recommended in the previous point, reviewers will associate authorship of such a previous work with the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: based on previous results [10] .. where the reference is reported as [10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted per double-blind reviewing. In doing so, however, please make sure that the SANER 2025 submission is self-contained and that its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper;  
 -Do not include acknowledgments of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgments in the camera-ready version;  
 -If you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead;  
 -Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course”. You can of course add the institutional information to the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply to work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may refer to the organization as Org or Company. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, videogame development company, etc.);  
 -Avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Whenever possible, please use the EasyChair additional material field to submit a .zip or .tgz file including additional material. This is of course possible for small attachments. In other cases, you may post anonymized links (with a warning that the following link may reveal authors’ identities), including links to anonymized code or deployments. When creating such repositories, a good practice can be asking somebody in your team to test the anonymization of the repository and its content. If the anonymization is difficult to achieve and you still want to provide the availability of data/tools, you can simply state that you will link to the code or deployment in the camera-ready version. Program committee members are asked to keep into account the double-blind policy when reviewing papers, and therefore not require full availability of artifacts at submission time.  
 -SANER 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors, we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and cite it. Please consider using Zenodo  , Figshare  , or other services that provide DOIs and allow anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org  is recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These datasets, anonymized through Zenodo and other services, should be linked within the paper itself. Instructions for double-blind friendly uploading of datasets are available here: https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance.html  .  
 -To submit your paper, please use the same submission link. After clicking on “Make a New Submission,” you will be presented with a list of all available tracks. Be sure to select the correct track (e.g., Short Papers and Posters Track), as illustrated in the attached screenshot.

  11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes - SAFEPROCESS 2022 Pafos, Cyprus, 8-10 June 2022 

 Welcome to SAFEPROCESS 2022  
   
 The Organizing Committee has the pleasure of inviting you to participate in the 11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes, to take place in Pafos, Cyprus, 8-10 June 2022  under the auspices of IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control.   
 SAFEPROCESS is organized every three years. The previous edition, was held in Warsaw, Poland in 2018. The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is a major international gathering of leading experts in the academia and industry from all over the worlds. It aims at strengthening the contact between the academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations.  
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertain conditions around the world, the organization of SAFEPROCESS has been transferred from 2021 to 2022, after approval from IFAC. We hope that the change in the dates of the Symposium will facilitate wider participation and the organization of a successful and wonderful SAFEPROCESS 2022, comparable with the high standards of previous SAFEPROCESS events.   
 SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held physically at the Aliathon Resort in Pafos, Cyprus. Physical participation is strongly encouraged, however to accommodate registrants who are unable to attend the Symposium physically due to the COVID pandemic, SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held in hybrid mode, thereby allowing virtual participation.

  The 16th International Symposium on Algorithmic Game Theory (SAGT) 

 Welcome to SAGT 2023  
 The 16th International Symposium on Algorithmic Game Theory (SAGT) will take place at Royal Holloway University of London from 4th-7th September 2023.  
 The purpose of SAGT is to bring together researchers from Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Operations Research, Psychology, Physics, and Biology to present and discuss original research at the intersection of Algorithms and Game Theory.  
   
 General Information  
 Scope  
   
  The program of SAGT 2023 will include invited lectures and presentations of peer-reviewed submissions. Foundational work is solicited on topics including but not limited to:  
 Auctions and pricing 
  Contract theory 
  Cooperative game theory 
  Cost-sharing algorithms and analysis 
  Decision theory 
  Efficiency of equilibria and Price of Anarchy 
  Equilibria, learning, and dynamics in games 
  Equilibrium computation and complexity 
  Fair division 
  Internet Economics 
  Incentives in Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies 
  Market design & matching markets 
  Mechanism design 
  Network games and graph-theoretic aspects of social networks 
  Reputation, recommendation and trust systems 
  Social choice and voting 
  Solution concepts in game theory 
  Industrial application works and position papers presenting novel ideas, issues, challenges and directions are also welcome.  
 The symposium proceedings will be published by Springer in its LNCS/ARCoSS series. Accepted papers will be allocated at most 18 pages in the proceedings (in particular, at most 16 pages for the technical part and at most 2 pages for references, in line with the submission guidelines). Alternatively, authors of accepted papers can choose to publish a one-page abstract in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper.  
 There will be a SAGT 2023 Best Paper Award, accompanied by a prize of 1,000 EURO offered by Springer.  

 Important Dates and Submissions  
   
  Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline:  4th May, 2023, 23:59 AoE 
  Submission Deadline: | 12th May, 2023, 23:59 AoE 
  Notification: | 1st July, 2023 
  Camera Ready Deadline: | 15th July, 2023 
  Conference Dates: | 4th-7th September, 2023 
  Submission Instructions  
 Authors are invited to submit original research for possible presentation at the conference. Each paper will be evaluated on significance, originality, technical quality, and exposition. It should clearly establish the research contribution, its relevance, and its relation to prior research.  
 Submission Format  
 Submissions must be in single-column format, with 11-point or larger fonts, using single-spacing between lines and 1-inch margins all around. For example, authors may want to use the LNCS style  , with the fullpage  package enabled (in LaTeX). Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines may be rejected without review.  
 This year, there will be no strict page limit for submissions, and authors are encouraged to submit the full versions of their papers. Still, the details of long papers will be read at the discretion of the program committee, so the authors are strongly encouraged to structure their paper in a way that includes a clear presentation of the merits of the paper and a discussion of the importance of the results, as well as an exposition of the key conceptual and technical ideas of the paper within the first 15 pages. Submissions shorter that 15 pages are also very much welcome.  
 We note that accepted papers will be allocated 18 pages in LNCS format in the proceedings. Please note that the LNCS format without the fullpage package has much wider page margins.  
 Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to SAGT, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline, will not be considered for publication as regular papers. Simultaneous submission of regular papers to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.  
 Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one page abstract in SAGT 2023.  
 Best Paper Award  
 There will be a SAGT 2023 Best Paper Award, accompanied by a prize of 1,000 EURO offered by Springer.  
 Submission Server and Deadline  
 This year, the submissions will be via OpenReview, a free submission platform that has successfully hosted prestigious conferences in the field for several years. The migration from EasyChair to OpenReview is because EasyChair has moved to a rather costly subscription model.  
 Please submit your work via the following link.   
 Submission deadline:  12th May 2023, 23:59 AoE  
 It is expected that every accepted paper will be presented at the conference by one of the authors.

  The 16th International Symposium on Algorithmic Game Theory (SAGT) 

 Welcome to SAGT 2023  
 The 16th International Symposium on Algorithmic Game Theory (SAGT) will take place at Royal Holloway University of London from 4th-7th September 2023.  
 The purpose of SAGT is to bring together researchers from Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Operations Research, Psychology, Physics, and Biology to present and discuss original research at the intersection of Algorithms and Game Theory.  
   
 General Information  
 Scope  
   
  The program of SAGT 2023 will include invited lectures and presentations of peer-reviewed submissions. Foundational work is solicited on topics including but not limited to:  
 Auctions and pricing 
  Contract theory 
  Cooperative game theory 
  Cost-sharing algorithms and analysis 
  Decision theory 
  Efficiency of equilibria and Price of Anarchy 
  Equilibria, learning, and dynamics in games 
  Equilibrium computation and complexity 
  Fair division 
  Internet Economics 
  Incentives in Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies 
  Market design & matching markets 
  Mechanism design 
  Network games and graph-theoretic aspects of social networks 
  Reputation, recommendation and trust systems 
  Social choice and voting 
  Solution concepts in game theory 
  Industrial application works and position papers presenting novel ideas, issues, challenges and directions are also welcome.  
 The symposium proceedings will be published by Springer in its LNCS/ARCoSS series. Accepted papers will be allocated at most 18 pages in the proceedings (in particular, at most 16 pages for the technical part and at most 2 pages for references, in line with the submission guidelines). Alternatively, authors of accepted papers can choose to publish a one-page abstract in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper.  
 There will be a SAGT 2023 Best Paper Award, accompanied by a prize of 1,000 EURO offered by Springer.  

 Important Dates and Submissions  
   
  Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline:  4th May, 2023, 23:59 AoE 
  Submission Deadline: | 12th May, 2023, 23:59 AoE 
  Notification: | 1st July, 2023 
  Camera Ready Deadline: | 15th July, 2023 
  Conference Dates: | 4th-7th September, 2023 
  Submission Instructions  
 Authors are invited to submit original research for possible presentation at the conference. Each paper will be evaluated on significance, originality, technical quality, and exposition. It should clearly establish the research contribution, its relevance, and its relation to prior research.  
 Submission Format  
 Submissions must be in single-column format, with 11-point or larger fonts, using single-spacing between lines and 1-inch margins all around. For example, authors may want to use the LNCS style  , with the fullpage  package enabled (in LaTeX). Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines may be rejected without review.  
 This year, there will be no strict page limit for submissions, and authors are encouraged to submit the full versions of their papers. Still, the details of long papers will be read at the discretion of the program committee, so the authors are strongly encouraged to structure their paper in a way that includes a clear presentation of the merits of the paper and a discussion of the importance of the results, as well as an exposition of the key conceptual and technical ideas of the paper within the first 15 pages. Submissions shorter that 15 pages are also very much welcome.  
 We note that accepted papers will be allocated 18 pages in LNCS format in the proceedings. Please note that the LNCS format without the fullpage package has much wider page margins.  
 Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to SAGT, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline, will not be considered for publication as regular papers. Simultaneous submission of regular papers to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.  
 Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one page abstract in SAGT 2023.  
 Best Paper Award  
 There will be a SAGT 2023 Best Paper Award, accompanied by a prize of 1,000 EURO offered by Springer.  
 Submission Server and Deadline  
 This year, the submissions will be via OpenReview, a free submission platform that has successfully hosted prestigious conferences in the field for several years. The migration from EasyChair to OpenReview is because EasyChair has moved to a rather costly subscription model.  
 Please submit your work via the following link.   
 Submission deadline:  12th May 2023, 23:59 AoE  
 It is expected that every accepted paper will be presented at the conference by one of the authors.
