 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 Dear colleagues,  
 We are excited to invite you to submit a paper to AIST’2024, a scientific conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks, and Texts. The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science focusing on innovative applications of data analysis and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of network data, text processing, and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems.  
 The conference is designed for computer scientists and practitioners whose research interests are related to data science. The eleven previous editions of the AIST conference held in 2012-2023 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics, and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems. Another important aim of the conference is to stimulate scientists and people from the industry to benefit from the knowledge exchange and identify possible grounds for fruitful collaboration.  
 Similar to the previous years, the main volume of the conference proceedings will be published in the Springer’s in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 Venue  
 The conference continues travelling to beautiful regions, and following Yerevan, Armenia in 2023 edition this year AIST will be held offline in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. More specifically the event is organized with support of Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University  and The Cramer Project  . Besides the scientific knowledge you will enjoy the nature of Kyrgyzstan and dive into local culture. The conference will feature representatives of the local data analysis community.

 About the Conference  
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.  
    Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering.  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing.  
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM.  
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences.  
 ALENEX will be held jointly with:  
  ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)   
  SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

  Online, Russia,  
  October 15-16, 2020.   
 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 We invite you to submit a paper to AIST-2020, a scientific conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks, and Texts. The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science focusing on innovative applications of data mining and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of social networks, text processing, and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems.  
 The previous conferences in 2012-2019 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics, and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems.  
 Past Conferences  
 Similar to the previous years, the conference proceedings will be published in the Springer’s in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. You can take a look at the proceedings of the last three years to get an idea about what kind of papers are accepted and what kind of topics are discussed at the conference:

  Call For Papers   
   
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. The following meetings will be held jointly: ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-06-13

  Emerging Researchers in ALife 

 Welcome to Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA)   

 We are the student chapter of ISAL, committed to fostering the next generation of Artificial Life researchers. ERA  brings together a diverse and dynamic community of emerging researchers, offering a space to connect, collaborate, and contribute to the exciting field of Artificial Life.  
 Since our founding in 2016, ERA  has been at the forefront of supporting early-career scientists—whether you’re a PhD student, postdoctoral researcher, or an independent scholar. We provide opportunities to engage with the broader Artificial Life community, including hosting an annual workshop at the flagship Artificial Life Conference  , where emerging researchers can network, share ideas, and build lasting professional relationships.  
   
 Our definition of “emerging researcher” is inclusive—if you see yourself as one, you’re part of our community!

 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 Dear colleagues,  
 We are excited to invite you to submit a paper to AIST’2024, a scientific conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks, and Texts. The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science focusing on innovative applications of data analysis and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of network data, text processing, and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems.  
 The conference is designed for computer scientists and practitioners whose research interests are related to data science. The eleven previous editions of the AIST conference held in 2012-2023 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics, and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems. Another important aim of the conference is to stimulate scientists and people from the industry to benefit from the knowledge exchange and identify possible grounds for fruitful collaboration.  
 Similar to the previous years, the main volume of the conference proceedings will be published in the Springer’s in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 Venue  
 The conference continues travelling to beautiful regions, and following Yerevan, Armenia in 2023 edition this year AIST will be held offline in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. More specifically the event is organized with support of Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University  and The Cramer Project  . Besides the scientific knowledge you will enjoy the nature of Kyrgyzstan and dive into local culture. The conference will feature representatives of the local data analysis community.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 ALGOWIN  
 2023   

 Starting from 2023 the ALGOSENSORS  event adopts a broader scope of wireless networks in general and its new acronym becomes ALGOWIN.  
 Scope  
 The International Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks  (ALGOWIN) is an international symposium dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. Originally focused on sensor networks, it now covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, and experimental analysis.  
  ALGOWIN 2023 will be held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It will be part of ALGO 2023  , which also hosts ALGOCLOUD  , ATMOS  , ESA  , IPEC  and WAOA  .

   Title:  Coordinated Motion Planning: Reconfiguring a Swarm of Robots  
 Abstract:   
 How do we coordinate the motion of many robots, vehicles, aircraft, or people? If each mobile agent has a destination in mind, how can it find an efficient route that avoids collisions with other agents as they simultaneously move to their destinations? These basic questions arise in many application domains, such as ground swarm robotics, aerial swarm robotics, air traffic control, warehouse management, and vehicular traffic networks. They also have a long tradition in Computational Geometry, reaching back at least until the seminal work of Schwartz and Sharir from the early 1980s.  
 In this talk, we consider a number of different algorithmic results. Starting with a labeled set of robots on a grid, we aim to minimize the total time for letting each agent reach its destination. We show that we can always achieve constant stretch, i.e., compute a well-choreographed set of trajectories in which the total time until completion is within a multiplicative constant of the largest initial distance. For settings in which the swarm needs to stay connected at all time, there are two additional sets of results, based on different approaches. In addition, we sketch some results for reconfiguring a swarm when agents do not have individual control, but have to follow uniform global forces.

    The Role of Research in Language Technology  
 The cutting-edge nature of Language Technology means that research is particularly important: there are many unsolved problems in the automated processing of spoken and written language, and in many cases we have only begun to scratch the surface. Research in Language Technology, which for our purposes covers a space that also includes Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, draws on work in a diverse array of disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy and computer science, and now, with the increasing role played by statistical methods also mathematics.  
 Research Activity in Australasia  
 Given the wide range of contributing disciplines, research in Language Technology in Australia and New Zealand is carried out in many different contexts. The listing below provides pointers to clusters of activity that involve more than one or two individual researchers.

 We invite you to contribute your best work for presentation at the AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium. The AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium showcases submissions from scientists, clinicians, trainees, educators, policy makers, administrators, industry professionals, and technologists from around the world.  
 The theme of AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium is Informatics in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence  . With Gen AI presenting itself to us in our personal and professional lives in so many ways, it is incumbent upon the informatics community to discuss the ways in which it can be used for enhancing healthcare and biomedicine, and the potential harms and blindsides to account for.  
 The AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium will consider submissions of the following types:  
 Paper 
  Student Paper 
  Podium Abstract 
  Poster 
  Panel 
  Informatics Debate 
  Systems Demonstration 
  Tutorials | (formerly known as Didactic Workshops) 
  Collaborative Workshop 
   
 All submission types must report the latest innovations from the informatics community. To support a diverse and inclusive environment, we will be offering program committee members, authors, reviewers, and moderators inclusive language guidelines and training. All submissions accepted for presentation at the AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium will be subject to review and agreement with the AMIA Inclusive Language Guidelines  .  
 Use of Generative AI  
 AMIA requires authors to disclose the use of generative AI techniques in their research when submitted to conferences. This policy aims to promote transparency and accountability in scientific discourse, ensuring that readers and reviewers are informed about the role of generative AI in the study's methodology. Authors should explicitly state the type of generative AI utilized, its parameters, and its impact on the research outcomes within the contribution submitted to the AMIA conference. Full disclosure fosters a comprehensive understanding of the study and facilitates the evaluation of scientific rigor and reproducibility. Failure to comply with this policy may result in the rejection or retraction by the Scientific Program Committee. You will be asked to complete a question on the submission form.  
 Target Audience  
 The target audience for this symposium includes all trainees and professionals in biomedical informatics and related disciplines. These related disciplines include physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, advanced practice professionals (APPs), and other clinicians; health information technology professionals; computer scientists and systems developers; policy makers; public health professionals; biomedical engineers and bioinformaticians; healthcare industry professionals; consultants and vendor representatives; medical librarians; academic researchers and scientists; and other individuals involved in the collection and dissemination of health information.  
 Inclusive Language  
 The AMIA Board of Directors approved an official resource as a submission guideline for AMIA meetings -- the AMIA Inclusive Language and Context Style Guidelines. The AMIA Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Communications Subcommittee created inclusive language guidelines to educate and empower authors, reviewers, and moderators to take responsibility for using inclusive language in AMIA scholarship.  
 Read the Inclusive Language and Context Style Guidelines   
   
 Presentation Types  
 The AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium will consider nine types of submissions. All submissions must conform to the format and presentation requirements described herein. Specific file formatting requirements as well as an example template are given below in the submission instructions section. Please also pay particular attention to instructions at the end on the File Format Requirements and Reference Format. Each submission should have up to three associated keywords to help in the selection of well-matched reviewers as well as organization of meeting sessions.  
 Important: Deviation from the prescribed format, especially the number of pages and modifications of template margins or font sizes, may result in rejection of the submission without review. Except for podium abstracts, submitted work must be original and not previously published.  
 Read the general requirements for each type, including limitations on page numbers; please note that page sizes are required to be U.S. Letter (8.5 x 11 inch):  
 Papers   
   
 Papers from all areas of biomedical informatics will be considered, with particular emphasis on those that align with the content themes for the AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium. Authors of accepted papers will have 15 minutes to present their work at the symposium including any time for answering questions.  
 Papers must not be in press or under consideration for presentation or publication elsewhere. However, authors retain the right to make a pre-print version of the paper available on recognized preprint repositories (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, PeerJ preprints, etc.) or personal/employer websites prior to acceptance for publication  
 Papers must be formatted to be 5-10 pages (including all tables, figures, references, and acknowledgements  ) in length and include:  
 The names, academic degree(s), affiliations, and locations (city, state, and country, if international) of all authors; 
  An abstract of 125-150 words summarizing the submission, which should also be entered into the online submission form; 
  Optional illustrations (figures or tables). 

 Student Papers   
   
 Students are invited to submit papers that describe complete or nearly complete research or development efforts in informatics which were primarily carried out by the student. All designated student papers follow the paper format requirements above, and they will first be reviewed through the standard review process, along with all other submitted papers. Student papers that are accepted will be presented in a regular paper session and included in the Annual Symposium Proceedings. Papers can only be submitted as a student paper or a regular paper, not both.   
 In addition, all accepted student papers will be referred to the Student Paper Advisory Committee (SPAC) for consideration for the Student Paper Competition. Eight student papers will be selected by the SPAC as finalists for the award competition and these eight papers will be presented at a special session. The eight finalist papers will be presented twice during the symposium (i.e., once in the Student Paper Competition session and once in a regular scientific session). It is up to the submitting student to ensure that their paper is correctly identified as a student paper proposal.  
 Individuals, who as of the submission deadline, are enrolled in a degree granting program or in an academic program, such as a medical residency or a post-doctoral fellowship, are eligible to enter a paper into the Student Paper Competition. Work performed as part of a large, collaborative effort is acceptable; however, the student paper will be judged on the student’s specific contributions to the project, which must be clearly delineated. Only individual students, not groups, may submit papers for consideration in the Student Paper Competition. Preparation of a manuscript must be entirely the work of the student. Entries from international students are encouraged.  
 The page requirements for Student Papers are identical to those of regular Paper submissions. Additionally, Student Papers submitted for consideration in the Student Paper Competition must provide the following information from each student:  
 The name and address of the training program; 
  Clear identification of the primary advisor of the student submitting the paper; 
  All co-authors and a description of each author's contribution to the work; 
  An attestation of the student's contribution to the manuscript with respect to the following items: (a) The text of the manuscript itself; (b) The data collected for any analysis; (c) The actual data analysis; (d) The review of the literature; (e) If a system was developed, the role of the student in the coding/development of the system; and (f) The evaluation of the results and the formation of the conclusion; 
  The student will be asked to upload a PDF of the attestation letter signed by their primary advisor confirming items a-f above. 
  The first author listed for a Student Paper submission must be the trainee who is eligible for the Student Paper Competition.  

 Podium Abstracts   
   
 The podium abstract format allows for the presentation of cutting-edge unpublished research that the author wishes to reserve publication rights for future consideration or outstanding work previously published in a peer-reviewed journal. Priority will be given to work that has not previously been unpublished or disseminated in other forums. Authors of accepted podium abstracts will have up to 18 minutes to present their work at the symposium including any questions and discussion.  
 Abstracts will NOT be indexed in MEDLINE, enabling authors to submit their best work that is destined for future journal publication. Contributions may also consist of abstracts based on work published in peer-reviewed journals in the last year (i.e., publication after March 2023); however, works published as proceedings for other conferences will not be accepted. Citation of the previous work is required.   
 Submissions must be submitted as a two-page (including all tables, figures, references, and acknowledgements)  document and include:  
 The names, academic degree(s), affiliations, and locations (city, state, and country, if international) of all authors; 
  A structured abstract must be submitted that includes the following sections: | Introduction – A short background and objective(s) of the study; 
  Methods – Design, setting (if appropriate), patients or participants (if appropriate), interventions (if appropriate), and main outcome measurement; 
  Results – Key findings; 
  Discussion – Key Conclusions with direct reference to the foundational advancement or biomedical application of the work; 
  Optional illustrations (figures or tables); 
  References. 
  In addition, all podium abstract submissions must have a brief (50-75 words) abstract. The abstract paragraph does NOT have to be part of the document  but must be entered on the submission website in the Abstract box on the online submission form.  

 Posters   
   
 Posters are the preferred format for presenting preliminary research or results of small-scale studies, illustrating and discussing innovative systems and services, describing experimental and in-practice projects and programs, reporting experiences with educational programs, and other dimensions of biomedical and health informatics. The poster sessions have been an increasingly vibrant and popular component of the symposium, offering direct access to the authors in a way not possible through podium presentations. Each accepted poster is displayed during one of the 90-minute poster sessions at the symposium. At least one author must be present at the poster session. Posters will not be indexed in MEDLINE.  
 Posters must reflect new work, and not reflect work that is in press or previously published elsewhere.

 Programmatic Themes  
 The AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium will be primarily organized around the six major areas of biomedical informatics, which reflect the spectrum of biomedical research and practice, from molecules to populations. Authors will be required to select one major thematic area of emphasis for their submission:  
 Academic Informatics / LIEAF   
   
 An opportunity for submissions demonstrating state-of-the-art approaches and best practices in education, research, training and workforce development. This thematic focus welcomes submissions related to the Linking Informatics and Education Academic Forum (LIEAF) program. Submissions include work addressing curricular and pedagogical challenges within academic informatics across a spectrum of education settings including high school, undergraduate, graduate level, postgraduate, and continuing professional education. The goal is to support the growth of programs, professionals, and the learners they educate by solving challenges and strengthening the academic informatics community.  

 Clinical Informatics   
   
 Applications of informatics in the healthcare setting, to improve the processes and outcomes of healthcare for patients and populations. Findings related to the design, development, and implementation and maintenance of state-of-the-art clinical systems, including electronic health records, standards and interoperability, clinical decision support, and effects on clinical quality, safety, and patient outcomes, are considered to be part of this programmatic theme.  

 Clinical Research Informatics   
   
 The use of informatics in the discovery and management of new knowledge relating to health and disease. It includes management of information related to clinical trials and also involves informatics related to secondary research use of clinical data. Clinical research informatics and translational bioinformatics are the primary domains related to informatics activities to support translational research.  

 Consumer Health Informatics   
   
 Devoted to informatics focusing on multiple consumer or patient views. These include patient-focused informatics, health literacy and consumer education. The focus is on information structures and processes that empower consumers to manage their own health – for example health information literacy, consumer-friendly language, personal health records, mHealth, and Internet-based strategies and resources. The shift in this view of informatics analyzes consumers' needs for information; studies and implements methods for making information accessible to consumers; and models and integrates consumers' preferences into health information systems. Consumer informatics stands at the crossroads of other disciplines, such as nursing informatics, public health, health promotion, health education, library science, and communication science.  

 Public Health Informatics   
   
 Applications of informatics in areas of public or population health, including surveillance, prevention, preparedness, and health promotion. The scope of public health is broad, focusing on the health of people and communities where they live, learn, work and play. Informatics applied to public health can therefore take many forms, including interoperable information systems to analyze data for biosurveillance, inform outbreak management in a community, provide immunization decision support, evaluate public health programs, model the spread of disease, and create understanding into the epidemiology of disease.  

 Translational Bioinformatics   
   
 The development of storage, analytic, and interpretive methods to optimize the transformation of increasingly voluminous biomedical data, and genomic data, into proactive, predictive, preventive, and participatory health. Translational bioinformatics includes research on the development of novel techniques for the integration of biological and clinical data and the evolution of clinical informatics methodology to encompass biological observations. The end product of translational bioinformatics is newly found knowledge from these integrative efforts that can be disseminated to a variety of stakeholders, including biomedical scientists, clinicians, and patients.  

 Scope and Breadth of the Annual Symposium  
 Thoughtful classification of your submission helps to ensure that each submission is reviewed by people knowledgeable about its content. In addition, it helps greatly in structuring the meeting sessions, allowing better grouping of papers and presentations by area of interest. We recognize that no classification system is perfect and ask you to use your best judgment in making the determination for which themes and keywords best reflect your submission’s content.  
 Keywords  
 The field of research and practice in biomedical informatics is as broad as the field of biomedicine and health care. Therefore, to facilitate the overall review process as well as support clustering of accepted submissions into meaningful sets, authors will be required to provide at least one, and up to three, keywords from the list below and up to five additional keywords that they feel best characterizes their work.

 Tracks  
 The AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium submissions will be categorized as either:  
 foundational contributions to informatics methods ("Foundations"); 
  reports on the application of informatics in the context of health ("Applications"); 
  discussions of policy topics influenced or impacted by informatics ("Policy"). 
  Reflecting the often cross-cutting implications of informatics innovations, submissions may be categorized into multiple tracks simultaneously.  
 From the time that authors begin to prepare their papers, abstracts, or proposals, they should consider whether their principal results and insights would more aptly be presented as a foundational, applied, policy, or some combination therein.  
 Authors are in the best position to make a final decision about track at the time they wish to classify their contribution. Note that all track assignments by authors will be reviewed by the SPC and subject to reclassification in selected cases.  
 Foundations   
   
 The Foundations track focuses on the conceptual and methodological advances that underpin the spectrum of biomedical informatics innovation. Contributions in this track should include work that presents progress in the generating, structuring, processing, managing, and analysis of biomedical and health information. Overall priority areas include the description and demonstration of methodologies that show promise in advancing the understanding and support of research and education in biological, clinical, and public health contexts.  

 Applications   
   
 The Applications track focuses on innovations in the design, technology, implementation, use, and evaluation of information systems and knowledge resources across the full spectrum of healthcare - in acute, ambulatory, and chronic care settings, public health departments, libraries, educational centers, and homes. Contributions to this track should emphasize applications that work in the real world to solve problems that impact or characterize health and well-being.  

 Policy   
   
 The Policy track focuses on informatics-relevant policies, policy recommendations, and policy evaluations, as well as the dependencies between informatics innovations and informatics policy. Priority will be given to those submissions that discuss informatics topics that may have either been influenced by policy decisions (e.g., Meaningful Use) or that may impact policy (e.g., 21st Century Cures Act). Contributions in this track should clearly identify policy implications and the role played by innovative informatics methodology.  

 Learning Objectives  
 Each submission at the AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium, regardless of the type, will require one learning objective as part of the submission.  
 As an accredited provider, AMIA must design all activities to inspire and enable change in the learner’s everyday practice.  
 AMIA is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education to physicians. 
  AMIA is accredited as a provider of nursing continuing professional development by the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation. 
  Resulting change may be a difference in knowledge and competence, performance, or patient outcomes. Educational design in this environment includes creating outcomes-based learning objectives. A good learning objective will define the desired outcome of your presentation by completing the sentence "After participating in my session the learner will be able to…"  
 Writing an Appropriate Learning Objective  
 Define what you want the learner to be able to do, or do better, after participating in your session. Be specific! Avoid words like "understand," "recognize," or "learn." Instead use words that denote action by the learner, like "implement,", "apply," "create," or "measure." 
  Perform a needs assessment. What new knowledge strategy, or skill will you provide so the learner can successfully incorporate change to their daily practice? Another way to think about this is to ask what the current standard practice is, compared to what it should be. Your presentation will provide the skills or strategies to make the change to best practice by the learner. 
  The learning objective you write to address these two questions will pique the learner’s interest in attending your session. 
  Examples of well-written learning objectives   
   
 After participating in this session, the learner should be better able to:  
 Understand the current issues in drug-allergy alerting systems, including high alert rate and low alert sensitivity, and be able to discuss and recommend several approaches to reducing drug-allergy alert burden in the electronic health records systems. 
  Learn challenges and possible solutions in creating and maintaining data elements for electronic health record systems across different clinical settings. 
  Learn the quality of clinical documents generated by speech recognition technology and understand errors in dictated clinical documents at different processing stages and their potential impact in patient care. 
  Formulate an approach to adoption of health information technology for the small physician group practice. (From the AMA) 

 Examples of poorly written learning objectives   
   
 After participating in this session, the learner should be better able to:  
 Define the healthcare protocol for the treatment and prevention of Stage III and IV pressure ulcers and apply to your own practice. | Too many verbs. An improved learning objective would be (From the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care): 
  “1) Define the healthcare protocol for the treatment of Stage III and IV pressure ulcers; 2) Define the healthcare protocol for the prevention of Stage III and IV pressure ulcers; and 3) Apply this knowledge to their own practice.” 
  Explain and discuss current initiatives and effective modalities to prevent incidence of complications such as infection or wrong-sided block. | This is a teaching objective. A learning objective on the same topic would be (From Winthrop University Hospital): 
  “Prevent incidence of complications such as infection or wrong-sided block using current initiatives and effective modalities.” 
  Become familiar with common eye problems. | The outcome is not measurable, there is no action the learner can take, and there is no context regarding the patient’s condition. Better learning objective (From the AAFP): 
  “Screen for eye conditions commonly associated with type 2 diabetes.” 

 Industry Submissions  
 Industry-authored and industry-client collaborative papers, abstracts, panels, demonstrations, and posters are welcome for submission as described above. No special submission designation is required. All industry submissions will be considered according to the standard review process. Industry submissions should not market and promote a specific product or company.  
 File Format Requirements  
 Your uploaded PDF file must be in compliance with the requirements listed under each Category of Submission. Papers, podium abstracts, panels, posters, and systems demonstrations will appear in the AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium Proceedings. Adherence to the following requirements throughout all categories of submission ensures a consistency that facilitates the review process and proceedings.

  Formatted for U.S. Letter (8.5 x 11 inch) paper size with one-inch margins left, right, top, and bottom. 
  And, the text within the Submission is formatted as follows: 
  Title is 14-point bold, centered, title case (using initial capitals for each word in the title other than articles and prepositions); 
  Below the title, are the names, credentials, institutions and locations of the author(s) or panelists, exactly as they are to appear in the online and print programs and the Proceedings, using 12-point Times New Roman typeface, single column, bold, centered, upper and lower case using appropriate capitals; 
  The main text of the submission is single-spaced in 10-point Times New Roman typeface, justified, one-column format; 
  Individual pages are not numbered; 
  All caps, bold, italics, or underline are only used for emphasis; 
  No track changes from word processing software. 
  The format of credentials and other author information appearing in the online and printed materials is subject to revision by the AMIA office. It is the responsibility of the submitting author of each proposal to provide full and accurate information about all authors named. 
  Submission Data Accuracy  
 All information in the conference website, online program, pocket guide, the mobile event app, and the Proceedings table of contents including but not limited to presentation title, author names, author affiliations, and the order in which the authors are listed is sourced directly from the online form authors fill out at the point of submission. Submitting authors are responsible for submitting full and accurate information exactly as you would like it to appear. Co-authors who reach out to AMIA staff about programmatic inaccuracies will be redirected to the submitting author to update/correct information in the submission system.  
 Reference Format  
 References must be included in the PDF document. Links to web pages will not be accepted. Bibliography and references must follow the Vancouver Style. Cite all references in the text, tables, or figure legends, using the following reference format: in the text, use eight-point superscript to indicate reference numbers; ten-point numbers in square brackets is an acceptable, although not preferred, alternative.  
 Under a centered heading "References" at the end of the submission, provide a list of references cited, in order of occurrence in the manuscript, and with titles using initial capital only. References must fit within the allotted page(s) for the respective submission categories. List all authors of any cited work when there are six or fewer authors; for more than six, list only the first three followed by "et al."

  Tutorial: 2 December 2024. 
  Main conference: 3 December and 4 December 2024. 
  Overview  
 The 22nd Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA) will be held in a hybrid format at the Australian National University, Canberra, from 2 December to 4 December 2024.  
 The hybrid format gives participants a valuable opportunity to attend either in-person or online. Participants who are unable to travel for various reasons (health, caring requirements, visa status, costs, etc.) are offered an online channel. With a hybrid format, we aim to increase the accessibility of participating in research communities throughout the workshop.  
 The ALTA 2024 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). It will feature presentations, posters, and demonstrations from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we also encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.  
 Note that ALTA is listed in the CORE 2023 Conference Rankings as Australasian C. See details from the CORE Rankings Portal  .  
 Topics  
 ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of NLP and CL, including, but not limited to:  
 Commonsense Reasoning. 
  Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics. 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems. 
  Discourse and Pragmatics. 
  Efficient Methods for NLP. 
  Ethics in NLP. 
  Information Extraction. 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining. 
  Interpretability, Interactivity and Analysis of Models for NLP. 
  Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond. 
  Language Modeling and Analysis of Language Models. 
  Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics. 
  Machine Learning for NLP. 
  Machine Translation. 
  Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity. 
  Natural Language Generation. 
  NLP Applications. 
  Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation. 
  Question Answering. 
  Resources and Evaluation. 
  Semantics: Lexical, Sentence level, Document Level, Textual Inference, etc. 
  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining. 
  Speech and Multimodality. 
  Summarisation. 
  Syntax, Parsing and their Applications. 
  We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community by considering practical applications of language technology and multidisciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from the industry.  
 Format  
 We invite submissions of three different formats: (1) Original Research Papers, (2) Abstract-based Presentations, and (3) Industry Demonstrations.  
 (1) Original Research Papers  
 We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.  
 Long papers should be 7-8 pages, and short papers should be 3-4 pages (see further details below). Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. In addition to the page count requirements, both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.  
 Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third-person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, properly anonymising public repositories, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.  
 (2) Abstract-based Presentations  
 To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organisers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner of interesting research, not limited to but including:  
 established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues; 
  completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work; 
  early candidature research students presenting their work in progress and ideas that may not have been published. 
  Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.  
 (3) Industry Demonstrations  
 To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organisation. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Original research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to ALTA and another venue, we will allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings or treated as a presentation (without archival publication). In this case, you can still present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.  
 Instructions for Authors  
 Paper Submission  
 Authors should submit their papers via OpenReview  using the ‘‘ALTA 2024 Workshop Submission’’ button.  
 Important Notice Regarding OpenReview Profile Creation  
 We would like to notify authors about OpenReview’s profile creation policy:  
 Profiles created without an institutional email (e.g., using Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) will undergo a moderation process that may take up to two weeks for approval. 
  Profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically without any delay. 
  To avoid any delays, we strongly recommend using an institutional email when creating your OpenReview profile  . Otherwise, please be aware of the potential two-week moderation period and plan accordingly towards the paper submission deadline.  
 Thank you for your understanding.  
 Formatting Guidelines  
 Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or the Microsoft Word template from https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files  .  
 Paper Length  
 Long papers: | 7-8 pages of content. 
  Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices. 
  Short papers: | 3-4 pages. 
  Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices. 
  About the appendices: While the appendix length is unlimited, it is essential to notify the authors that reviewers are not required to read it. The main text should be self-explanatory, with the appendix used only to highlight additional details. 
  Abstracts ideally should be a few paragraphs and no more than two (2) pages. 
  Industry demonstration proposals should be 1-2 pages. 
  Anonymisation  
 Short and long papers must be anonymised. 
  Abstracts are NOT to be anonymised and must include the author’s/authors’ affiliation.

 The Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) 2025 conference will be held in Milan, Italy on February 24-27, 2025. The conference is dedicated to all theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning. We invite submissions with contributions to new or existing learning problems including, but not limited to: Design and analysis of learning algorithms. Statistical and computational learning theory. Online learning algorithms and theory. Optimization methods for learning. Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning. Interactive learning, planning and control, and reinforcement learning. Privacy-preserving data analysis. Learning with additional societal and strategic considerations: e.g., fairness, economics. Robustness of learning algorithms to adversarial agents. Artificial neural networks, including deep learning. High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics. Adaptive data analysis and selective inference. Learning with algebraic or combinatorial structure. Bayesian methods in learning. Learning in distributed and streaming settings. Game theory and learning. Learning from complex data: e.g., networks, time series. While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis by including relevant experimental results. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), and will be presented at the conference as a full-length talk. Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for ALT.

26. Conference ANT_0:
The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies  
  April 22-24, 2025, Patras, Greece   

  to ANT 2025  
 The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2025) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  
 ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years.  
 Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level).  
 All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex).

 Analysis of Algorithms  
 Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs permutations, trees, and strings.  
 The area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth  wrote "Notes on Open Addressing". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming  , established ties between areas of study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.  
 Thirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorithms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to the analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual or biennial schedule; see the meetings page  for links to some of these meetings.  
 This website is dedicated to promoting the Analysis of Algorithms. All visitors are welcome! To stay updated on new developments in our community, make sure to subscribe to our mailing list  . The information collected here is intended to assist both new and experienced scholars in their research and its applications.

 AMIA 2022 Annual Symposium   
  November 5  - 9    
   
    Washington, DC   
   
 #AMIA2022   

 LIEAF 
  More 

 The Annual Symposium builds on more than 45 years of sharing research and insights for leveraging health information and cutting-edge technologies to improve human health. Scientific evidence is the language of trust in healthcare, and this year’s theme is Informatics: Building the Evidence Base.    
 Among many other things, 2020 made us aware of the value of our community – a community that we have missed: colleagues, mentors, experts, and students with a shared interest in informatics. The past few years demonstrated the necessity in our country for access to information to improve health and health care, and the need for professionals to use and apply that information to transform health care.

 Call for Submission   
 For ASCS call for submission, see https://ascs2024.iscbsc.org/   
 The Asia & Pacific Bioinformatics Joint Conference (APBJC) is a collaborative platform aimed at expediting the advancement of bioinformatics in the Asia & Pacific region. This joint initiative is primarily organized by the Japanese Society for Bioinformatics (JSBi), Asia - Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNET), International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), the International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW), and the Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC). APBJC also benefits from the active involvement and support of numerous regional bioinformatics societies, reflecting a collective commitment to fostering progress and innovation in the field.  
 APBJC 2024 welcomes abstract submissions featuring research at the forefront of bioinformatics and computational biology. We encourage the submission of original work, whether it is in progress or has been previously published within the last 18 months, for consideration for oral and/or poster presentation.  
 All presentations are categorized based on scientific topics, ensuring a cohesive organization of talks and posters. Please ensure that your abstract communicates a scientific result and refrains from serving as an advertisement for any commercial software package or products.  
 APBJC 2024 embraces a broad interpretation of bioinformatics/computational biology. Topics of particular interest encompass, but are not limited to, the following:  
 SINGLE-CELL ANALYSIS:   Advancements in single-cell technologies have allowed researchers to delve deeper into understanding cellular heterogeneity, cell signaling, and gene expression at the single-cell level. Analyzing large-scale single-cell data poses challenges in computational methods, driving innovation in this area.   AI AND THEIR APPLICATIONS:   The application of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence in various omics fields has been rapidly expanding. In genomics, these techniques aid in predictive modeling, variant calling, drug discovery, functional genomics, and interpreting complex biological data. They have also been prominent in protein structure prediction, as well as other omics fields such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics.   PROTEIN/RNA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS, PREDICTION AND DESIGN:   Cutting-edge computational methods are revolutionizing our ability to predict and design the structures of proteins and RNA molecules. These advancements hold immense potential for developing new drugs, understanding fundamental biological functions, and creating innovative therapeutics.   PERSONALIZED MEDICINE AND COMPUTATIONAL GENETICS:   Computational approaches are instrumental in analyzing large-scale genomic and clinical data to tailor treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. Precision oncology, in particular, relies on computational biology for tumor profiling, drug sensitivity prediction, and identifying potential therapeutic targets.   METAGENOMICS AND MICROBIOME ANALYSIS:   Computational tools play a crucial role in studying complex microbial communities and their impact on human health, agriculture, and the environment. Analyzing metagenomic data involves developing algorithms for taxonomic classification, functional profiling, and understanding microbial interactions.   NETWORK BIOLOGY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY:   Computational modeling of biological networks, such as protein-protein interactions, metabolic pathways, and gene regulatory networks, helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex biological systems. Systems biology integrates computational and experimental approaches to study biological systems holistically.   DRUG DISCOVERY AND REPURPOSING:   Computational methods are extensively used in virtual screening, molecular docking, and drug-target interaction prediction. These approaches accelerate drug discovery and enable the repurposing of existing drugs for new therapeutic applications.   ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES(ELSI):   With the increasing volume of biological data being generated, there is a growing emphasis on addressing ethical concerns, ensuring data privacy, and developing frameworks for responsible data sharing and usage in computational biology research.   BIOINFORMATICS EDUCATION:   Bioinformatics education is fast advancing by reflecting substantial changes in the expanding research areas and educational tools.   OMICS-Based INFORMATICS:   Various informatics resources and technologies have been developed for omics data accumulated via high-throughput technologies.   DATABASES, ONTOLOGIES AND BIOCURATION:   To effectively manage the vast amounts of biological data generated by advanced measurement techniques, it is increasingly crucial to design interoperable and reusable biological databases, construct ontologies for precise data representation in life sciences, and refine biocuration workflows to enhance data quality and accessibility.   EVOLUTIONARY, COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND PHYLOGENETICS:   New discoveries as well as groundbreaking methods are being made for comparing genomic data and revealing the evolutionary histories and relationships of diverse species.   SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING:   Engineering biology enabling the intentional design, manufacture and deployment of living cells, cell systems, and other biological processes to create materials and products for benefiting humanity.   GENERAL COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY:   Other topics related to computational biology not listed above.   OTHERS:   Other topics not listed above   Guidelines for Multiple talks   
 To ensure diverse content and maximize participation, the same oral presentation is not permitted to be delivered more than once at APBJC 2024. However, research may be presented in both oral and poster formats. While having the same individual present two (or more) distinct talks is allowed, it is not encouraged. Furthermore, while a presenting author is welcome to present more than one poster, these should not be posters which are scheduled in the same poster session. We strongly encourage labs to engage multiple lab members to foster a collaborative and comprehensive representation of their research efforts.  
  
 Abstracts: Deadlines   
 Any recent research, published or unpublished, is eligible for submission and should be received by July 7  . Acceptance notifications will be sent no later than July 28  . The conference will accept late poster abstracts beginning July 30 and ending August 7  .  
  
 Abstracts: Submission Guidelines   
 The presenter should be identified during the submission process. Presenters of accepted abstracts are required to make the presentation themselves, and must register and pay to attend the conference.  
 Submitters may choose to have their submission reviewed for: (i) talk only, (ii) talk and poster  or (iii) poster only  . If you select talk and poster, and are unsuccessful for a talk, your abstract will automatically be considered for a poster presentation. Submissions must be received by July 7.  
 Participants who opt for (i) talk only or (ii) talk and poster are required to submit:  Both a 200-word abstract to be posted on the conference website AND a long abstract of up to two (2) pages in PDF format.   Participants who opt for (iii) poster only are required to submit:  A 200-word abstract to be posted on the conference website.   All abstracts must be submitted using the conference submission site by the abstract deadline: | July 7 | . 
  The 200-word abstract should be a brief and concise summary of the background/motivation for the study, method and result (s), as well as conclusion/statement of significance. The abstract is submitted through the EasyChair submission system. 
  Accepted abstracts (maximum 200 words) will be posted on the conference web site. 
  For authors requesting a talk you should upload a long abstract of up to two (2) pages in PDF format during the submission process, to provide additional details including figures and graphics that support the main points of the abstract. *Do not submit more than two pages* 
  Your abstract must not contain your title/position or any personal information (e.g. affiliation). These details will be collected through the EasyChair submission system. 
  Selected Abstract talks will be presented in tracks that run in parallel at the conference.

 Fringe Trees for Random Trees with Given Vertex Degrees   
 Authors:  Gabriel Berzunza Ojeda, Cecilia Holmgren, and Svante Janson  
  Abstract    
 We prove that the number of fringe subtrees, isomorphic to a given tree, in uniformly random trees with given vertex degrees, asymptotically follows a normal distribution. As an application, we establish the same asymptotic normality for random simply generated trees (conditioned Galton-Watson trees). Our approach relies on an extension of Gao and Wormald’s (2004) theorem to the multivariate setting.

 We use a novel decomposition to create succinct data structures - supporting a wide range of operations on static trees in constant time - for a variety of tree classes, extending results of Munro, Nicholson, Benkner, and Wild. Motivated by the class of AVL trees, we further derive asymptotics for the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of bits needed to store tree classes whose generating functions satisfy certain functional equations. In particular, we prove that AVL trees require approximately 0.938 bits per node to encode.

 Maximal Number of Subword Occurrences in a Word   
 Authors:  Wenjie Fang  
  Abstract    
 We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations.

 Sparsification of Phylogenetic Covariance Matrices of k-Regular Trees   
 Authors:  Sean Svihla and Manuel E. Lladser  
  Abstract    
 Consider a tree T = (V,E) with root ∘ and an edge length function 𝓁:E → ℝ_+. The phylogenetic covariance matrix of T is the matrix C with rows and columns indexed by L, the leaf set of T, with entries C(i,j): = ∑_{e ∈ [i∧ j,o]}𝓁(e), for each i,j ∈ L. Recent work [Gorman & Lladser 2023] has shown that the phylogenetic covariance matrix of a large but random binary tree T is significantly sparsified, with overwhelmingly high probability, under a change-of-basis to the so-called Haar-like wavelets of T. Notably, this finding enables manipulating the spectrum of covariance matrices of large binary trees without the necessity to store them in computer memory but instead performing two post-order traversals of the tree [Gorman & Lladser 2023]. Building on the methods of the aforesaid paper, this manuscript further advances their sparsification result to encompass the broader class of k-regular trees, for any given k ≥ 2. This extension is achieved by refining existing asymptotic formulas for the mean and variance of the internal path length of random k-regular trees, utilizing hypergeometric function properties and identities.

 Bit-Array-Based Alternatives to HyperLogLog   
 Authors:  Svante Janson, Jérémie Lumbroso, and Robert Sedgewick  
  Abstract    
 We present a family of algorithms for the problem of estimating the number of distinct items in an input stream that are simple to implement and are appropriate for practical applications. Our algorithms are a logical extension of the series of algorithms developed by Flajolet and his coauthors starting in 1983 that culminated in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm. These algorithms divide the input stream into M substreams and lead to a time-accuracy tradeoff where a constant number of bits per substream are saved to achieve a relative accuracy proportional to 1/√M. Our algorithms use just one or two bits per substream. Their effectiveness is demonstrated by a proof of approximate normality, with explicit expressions for standard errors that inform parameter settings and allow proper quantitative comparisons with other methods. Hypotheses about performance are validated through experiments using a realistic input stream, with the conclusion that our algorithms are more accurate than HyperLogLog when using the same amount of memory, and they use two-thirds as much memory as HyperLogLog to achieve a given accuracy.

 Phase Transition for Tree-Rooted Maps   
 Authors:  Marie Albenque, Éric Fusy, and Zéphyr Salvy  
  Abstract    
 We introduce a model of tree-rooted planar maps weighted by their number of 2-connected blocks. We study its enumerative properties and prove that it undergoes a phase transition. We give the distribution of the size of the largest 2-connected blocks in the three regimes (subcritical, critical and supercritical) and further establish that the scaling limit is the Brownian Continuum Random Tree in the critical and supercritical regimes, with respective rescalings √{n/log(n)} and √n.

 Composition Schemes: q-Enumerations and Phase Transitions in Gibbs Models   
 Authors:  Cyril Banderier, Markus Kuba, Stephan Wagner, and Michael Wallner  
  Abstract    
 Composition schemes are ubiquitous in combinatorics, statistical mechanics and probability theory. We give a unifying explanation to various phenomena observed in the combinatorial and statistical physics literature in the context of q-enumeration (this is a model where objects with a parameter of value k have a Gibbs measure/Boltzmann weight q^k). For structures enumerated by a composition scheme, we prove a phase transition for any parameter having such a Gibbs measure: for a critical value q = q_c, the limit law of the parameter is a two-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution, while it is Gaussian in the supercritical regime (q > q_c), and it is a Boltzmann distribution in the subcritical regime (0 < q < q_c). We apply our results to fundamental statistics of lattice paths and quarter-plane walks. We also explain previously observed limit laws for pattern-restricted permutations, and a phenomenon uncovered by Krattenthaler for the wall contacts in watermelons.

 Galled Tree-Child Networks   
 Authors:  Yu-Sheng Chang, Michael Fuchs, and Guan-Ru Yu  
  Abstract    
 We propose the class of galled tree-child networks which is obtained as intersection of the classes of galled networks and tree-child networks. For the latter two classes, (asymptotic) counting results and stochastic results have been proved with very different methods. We show that a counting result for the class of galled tree-child networks follows with similar tools as used for galled networks, however, the result has a similar pattern as the one for tree-child networks. In addition, we also consider the (suitably scaled) numbers of reticulation nodes of random galled tree-child networks and show that they are asymptotically normal distributed. This is in contrast to the limit laws of the corresponding quantities for galled networks and tree-child networks which have been both shown to be discrete.

 On Fluctuations of Complexity Measures for the FIND Algorithm   
 Authors:  Jasper Ischebeck and Ralph Neininger  
  Abstract    
 The FIND algorithm (also called Quickselect) is a fundamental algorithm to select ranks or quantiles within a set of data. It was shown by Grübel and Rösler that the number of key comparisons required by FIND as a process of the quantiles α ∈ [0,1] in a natural probabilistic model converges after normalization in distribution within the càdlàg space D[0,1] endowed with the Skorokhod metric. We show that the process of the residuals in the latter convergence after normalization converges in distribution to a mixture of Gaussian processes in D[0,1] and identify the limit’s conditional covariance functions. A similar result holds for the related algorithm QuickVal. Our method extends to other cost measures such as the number of swaps (key exchanges) required by FIND or cost measures which are based on key comparisons but take into account that the cost of a comparison between two keys may depend on their values, an example being the number of bit comparisons needed to compare keys given by their bit expansions.

 A Bijection for the Evolution of B-Trees   
 Authors:  Fabian Burghart and Stephan Wagner  
  Abstract    
 A B-tree is a type of search tree where every node (except possibly for the root) contains between m and 2m keys for some positive integer m, and all leaves have the same distance to the root. We study sequences of B-trees that can arise from successively inserting keys, and in particular present a bijection between such sequences (which we call histories) and a special type of increasing trees. We describe the set of permutations for the keys that belong to a given history, and also show how to use this bijection to analyse statistics associated with B-trees.

 Tree Walks and the Spectrum of Random Graphs   
 Authors:  Eva-Maria Hainzl and Élie de Panafieu  
  Abstract    
 It is a classic result in spectral theory that the limit distribution of the spectral measure of random graphs G(n,p) converges to the semicircle law in case np tends to infinity with n. The spectral measure for random graphs G(n,c/n) however is less understood. In this work, we combine and extend two combinatorial approaches by Bauer and Golinelli (2001) and Enriquez and Menard (2016) and approximate the moments of the spectral measure by counting walks that span trees.

 Asymptotics of Weighted Reflectable Walks in A₂   
 Authors:  Torin Greenwood and Samuel Simon  
  Abstract    
 Lattice walks are used to model various physical phenomena. In particular, walks within Weyl chambers connect directly to representation theory via the Littelmann path model. We derive asymptotics for centrally weighted lattice walks within the Weyl chamber corresponding to A₂ by using tools from analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV). We find universality classes depending on the weights of the walks, in line with prior results on the weighted Gouyou-Beauchamps model. Along the way, we identify a type of singularity within a multivariate rational generating function that is not yet covered by the theory of ACSV. We conjecture asymptotics for this type of singularity.

 On the Number of Distinct Fringe Subtrees in Binary Search Trees   
 Authors:  Stephan Wagner  
  Abstract    
 A fringe subtree of a rooted tree is a subtree that consists of a vertex and all its descendants. The number of distinct fringe subtrees in random trees has been studied by several authors, notably because of its connection to tree compaction algorithms. Here, we obtain a very precise result for binary search trees: it is shown that the number of distinct fringe subtrees in a binary search tree with n leaves is asymptotically equal to (c₁n)/(log n) for a constant c₁ ≈ 2.4071298335, both in expectation and with high probability. This was previously shown to be a lower bound, our main contribution is to prove a matching upper bound. The method is quite general and can also be applied to similar problems for other tree models.

 Early Typical Vertices in Subcritical Random Graphs of Preferential Attachment Type   
 Authors:  Peter Mörters and Nick Schleicher  
  Abstract    
 We study the size of the connected component of early typical vertices in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The principal tools in our analysis are, first, a coupling of the neighbourhood of a typical vertex in the graph to a killed branching random walk and, second, an asymptotic result for the number of particles absorbed at the killing barrier in this branching random walk.

 Asymptotics of Relaxed k-Ary Trees   
 Authors:  Manosij Ghosh Dastidar and Michael Wallner  
  Abstract    
 A relaxed k-ary tree is an ordered directed acyclic graph with a unique source and sink in which every node has out-degree k. These objects arise in the compression of trees in which some repeated subtrees are factored and repeated appearances are replaced by pointers. We prove an asymptotic theta-result for the number of relaxed k-ary tree with n nodes for n → ∞. This generalizes the previously proved binary case to arbitrary finite arity, and shows that the seldom observed phenomenon of a stretched exponential term e^{c n^{1/3}} appears in all these cases. We also derive the recurrences for compacted k-ary trees in which all subtrees are unique and minimal deterministic finite automata accepting a finite language over a finite alphabet.

 Matching Algorithms in the Sparse Stochastic Block Model   
 Authors:  Anna Brandenberger, Byron Chin, Nathan S. Sheffield, and Divya Shyamal  
  Abstract    
 In sparse Erdős-Rényi graphs, it is known that a linear-time algorithm of Karp and Sipser achieves near-optimal matching sizes asymptotically almost surely, giving a law-of-large numbers for the matching numbers of such graphs in terms of solutions to an ODE [Jonathan Aronson et al., 1998]. We provide an extension of this analysis, identifying broad ranges of stochastic block model parameters for which the Karp-Sipser algorithm achieves near-optimal matching sizes, but demonstrating that it cannot perform optimally on general stochastic block model instances. We also consider the problem of constructing a matching online, in which the vertices of one half of a bipartite stochastic block model arrive one-at-a-time, and must be matched as they arrive. We show that, when the expected degrees in all communities are equal, the competitive ratio lower bound of 0.837 found by Mastin and Jaillet for the Erdős-Rényi case [Andrew Mastin and Patrick Jaillet, 2013] is achieved by a simple greedy algorithm, and this competitive ratio is optimal. We then propose and analyze a linear-time online matching algorithm with better performance in general stochastic block models.

 Lexicographic Unranking Algorithms for the Twelvefold Way   
 Authors:  Amaury Curiel and Antoine Genitrini  
  Abstract    
 The Twelvefold Way represents Rota’s classification, addressing the most fundamental enumeration problems and their associated combinatorial counting formulas. These distinct problems are connected to enumerating functions defined from a set of elements denoted by 𝒩 into another one 𝒦. The counting solutions for the twelve problems are well known. We are interested in unranking algorithms. Such an algorithm is based on an underlying total order on the set of structures we aim at constructing. By taking the rank of an object, i.e. its number according to the total order, the algorithm outputs the structure itself after having built it. One famous total order is the lexicographic order: it is probably the one that is the most used by people when one wants to order things. While the counting solutions for Rota’s classification have been known for years it is interesting to note that three among the problems have yet no lexicographic unranking algorithm. In this paper we aim at providing algorithms for the last three cases that remain without such algorithms. After presenting in detail the solution for set partitions associated with the famous Stirling numbers of the second kind, we explicitly explain how to adapt the algorithm for the two remaining cases. Additionally, we propose a detailed and fine-grained complexity analysis based on the number of bitwise arithmetic operations.

 Periodic Behavior of the Minimal Colijn-Plazzotta Rank for Trees with a Fixed Number of Leaves   
 Authors:  Michael R. Doboli, Hsien-Kuei Hwang, and Noah A. Rosenberg  
  Abstract    
 The Colijn-Plazzotta ranking is a certain bijection between the unlabeled binary rooted trees and the positive integers, such that the integer associated with a tree is determined from the integers associated with the two immediate subtrees of its root. Letting a_n denote the minimal Colijn-Plazzotta rank among all trees with a specified number of leaves n, the sequence {a_n} begins 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 20, 22, 28, 29, 53, 56, 66, 67 (OEIS A354970). Here we show that a_n ∼ 2 [2^{P(log₂ n)}]ⁿ, where P varies as a periodic function dependent on {log₂ n} and satisfies 1.24602 < 2^{P(log₂ n)} < 1.33429.

 Binomial Sums and Mellin Asymptotics with Explicit Error Bounds: A Case Study   
 Authors:  Benjamin Hackl and Stephan Wagner  
  Abstract    
 Making use of a newly developed package in the computer algebra system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis by means of the Mellin transform with explicit error bounds. As an application of the method, we answer a question of Bóna and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.

 Multicoloured Hardcore Model: Fast Mixing and Its Applications as a Scheduling Algorithm   
 Authors:  Sam Olesker-Taylor  
  Abstract    
 In the hardcore model, certain vertices in a graph are active: the active vertices must form an independent set. We extend this to a multicoloured version: instead of simply being active or not, the active vertices are assigned a colour; active vertices of the same colour must not be adjacent. This models a scenario in which two neighbouring resources may interfere when active - eg, short-range radio communication. However, there are multiple channels (colours) available; they only interfere if both use the same channel. Other applications include routing in fibreoptic networks. We analyse Glauber dynamics. Vertices update their status at random times, at which a uniform colour is proposed: the vertex is assigned that colour if it is available; otherwise, it is set inactive. We find conditions for fast mixing of these dynamics. We also use them to model a queueing system: vertices only serve customers in their queue whilst active. The mixing estimates are applied to establish positive recurrence of the queue lengths, and bound their expectation in equilibrium.

 Binary Search Trees of Permuton Samples   
 Authors:  Benoît Corsini, Victor Dubach, and Valentin Féray  
  Abstract    
 Binary search trees (BST) are a popular type of structure when dealing with ordered data. They allow efficient access and modification of data, with their height corresponding to the worst retrieval time. From a probabilistic point of view, BSTs associated with data arriving in a uniform random order are well understood, but less is known when the input is a non-uniform permutation. We consider here the case where the input comes from i.i.d. random points in the plane with law μ, a model which we refer to as a permuton sample. Our results show that the asymptotic proportion of nodes in each subtree only depends on the behavior of the measure μ at its left boundary, while the height of the BST has a universal asymptotic behavior for a large family of measures μ. Our approach involves a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, namely combinatorial properties of binary search trees, coupling arguments, and deviation estimates.

 The Recurrence/Transience of Random Walks on a Bounded Grid in an Increasing Dimension   
 Authors:  Shuma Kumamoto, Shuji Kijima, and Tomoyuki Shirai  
  Abstract    
 It is celebrated that a simple random walk on ℤ and ℤ² returns to the initial vertex v infinitely many times during infinitely many transitions, which is said recurrent, while it returns to v only finite times on ℤ^d for d ≥ 3, which is said transient. It is also known that a simple random walk on a growing region on ℤ^d can be recurrent depending on growing speed for any fixed d. This paper shows that a simple random walk on {0,1,…,N}ⁿ with an increasing n and a fixed N can be recurrent depending on the increasing speed of n. Precisely, we are concerned with a specific model of a random walk on a growing graph (RWoGG) and show a phase transition between the recurrence and transience of the random walk regarding the growth speed of the graph. For the proof, we develop a pausing coupling argument introducing the notion of weakly less homesick as graph growing (weakly LHaGG).

 The Alternating Normal Form of Braids and Its Minimal Automaton   
 Authors:  Vincent Jugé and June Roupin  
  Abstract    
 The alternating normal form of braids is a well-known normal form on standard braid monoids. This normal form is regular: the language it identifies with is regular. We give a characterisation of the minimal automaton of this language and compute its size, both in terms of number of states and of transitions, depending on the number of generators of the monoid.

 Analysis of Regular Sequences: Summatory Functions and Divide-And-Conquer Recurrences   
 Authors:  Clemens Heuberger, Daniel Krenn, and Tobias Lechner  
  Abstract    
 In the asymptotic analysis of regular sequences as defined by Allouche and Shallit, it is usually advisable to study their summatory function because the original sequence has a too fluctuating behaviour. It might be that the process of taking the summatory function has to be repeated if the sequence is fluctuating too much. In this paper we show that for all regular sequences except for some degenerate cases, repeating this process finitely many times leads to a "nice" asymptotic expansion containing periodic fluctuations whose Fourier coefficients can be computed using the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences by the first two authors of this paper. In a recent paper, Hwang, Janson, and Tsai perform a thorough investigation of divide-and-conquer recurrences. These can be seen as 2-regular sequences. By considering them as the summatory function of their forward difference, the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences become applicable. We thoroughly investigate the case of a polynomial toll function.

 Patricia’s Bad Distributions   
 Authors:  Louigi Addario-Berry, Pat Morin, and Ralph Neininger  
  Abstract    
 The height of a random PATRICIA tree built from independent, identically distributed infinite binary strings with arbitrary diffuse probability distribution μ on {0,1}^ℕ is studied. We show that the expected height grows asymptotically sublinearly in the number of leaves for any such μ, but can be made to exceed any specific sublinear growth rate by choosing μ appropriately.

 Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs   
 Authors:  Umberto De Ambroggio, Tamás Makai, Konstantinos Panagiotou, and Annika Steibel  
  Abstract    
 We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph G, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, M particles are placed on a vertex of G. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time. In this work we study the case where G is the complete graph on n vertices and the number of particles is M = n/2+α n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2}), α ∈ ℝ. This choice of M corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by n^{-1/2}, converges in p-th mean, as n → ∞ and for any p ∈ ℝ, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable T_α. We find that T_α is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that 𝔼[T₀] = π^{3/2}/√7, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when |α| gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by nln(n), it converges to 2/7 in probability.

 Asymptotic Enumeration of Rooted Binary Unlabeled Galled Trees with a Fixed Number of Galls   
 Authors:  Lily Agranat-Tamir, Michael Fuchs, Bernhard Gittenberger, and Noah A. Rosenberg  
  Abstract    
 Galled trees appear in problems concerning admixture, horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, and recombination. Building on a recursive enumerative construction, we study the asymptotic behavior of the number of rooted binary unlabeled (normal) galled trees as the number of leaves n increases, maintaining a fixed number of galls g. We find that the exponential growth with n of the number of rooted binary unlabeled normal galled trees with g galls has the same value irrespective of the value of g ≥ 0. The subexponential growth, however, depends on g; it follows c_g n^{2g-3/2}, where c_g is a constant dependent on g. Although for each g, the exponential growth is approximately 2.4833ⁿ, summing across all g, the exponential growth is instead approximated by the much larger 4.8230ⁿ.

 Sharpened Localization of the Trailing Point of the Pareto Record Frontier   
 Authors:  James Allen Fill, Daniel Q. Naiman, and Ao Sun  
  Abstract    
 For d ≥ 2 and i.i.d. d-dimensional observations X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, … with independent Exponential(1) coordinates, we revisit the study by Fill and Naiman (Electron. J. Probab., 25:Paper No. 92, 24 pp., 2020) of the boundary (relative to the closed positive orthant), or "frontier", F_n of the closed Pareto record-setting (RS) region RS_n := {0 ≤ x ∈ R^d: x ⊀ X^(i) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n} at time n, where 0 ≤ x means that 0 ≤ x_j for 1 ≤ j ≤ d and x ≺ y means that x_j < y_j for 1 ≤ j ≤ d. With x_+ : = ∑_{j = 1}^d x_j = ‖x‖₁, let F_n^- := min{x_+: x ∈ F_n} and F_n^+ : = max{x_+: x ∈ F_n}. Almost surely, there are for each n unique vectors λ_n ∈ F_n and τ_n ∈ F_n such that F_n^+ = (λ_n)_+ and F_n^- = (τ_n)_+; we refer to λ_n and τ_n as the leading and trailing points, respectively, of the frontier. Fill and Naiman provided rather sharp information about the typical and almost sure behavior of F^+, but somewhat crude information about F^-, namely, that for any ε > 0 and c_n → ∞ we have P(F_n^- - ln n ∈ (- (2 + ε) ln ln ln n, c_n)) → 1 (describing typical behavior) and almost surely limsup (F_n^- - ln n)/(ln ln n) ≤ 0 and liminf (F_n^- - ln n)/(ln ln ln n) ∈ [-2, -1]. In this extended abstract we use the theory of generators (minima of F_n) together with the first- and second-moment methods to improve considerably the trailing-point location results to F_n^- - (ln n - ln ln ln n) ⟶P -ln(d - 1) (describing typical behavior) and, for d ≥ 3, almost surely limsup [F_n^- -(ln n - ln ln ln n)] ≤ -ln(d - 2) + ln 2 and liminf [F_n^- -(ln n - ln ln ln n)] ≥ -ln d - ln 2.

 Statistics of Parking Functions and Labeled Forests   
 Authors:  Stephan Wagner and Mei Yin  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we obtain some new results on the enumeration of parking functions and labeled forests. We introduce new statistics both for parking functions and for labeled forests that are connected to each other by means of a bijection. We determine the joint distribution of two statistics on parking functions and their counterparts on labeled forests. Our results on labeled forests also serve to explain the mysterious equidistribution between two seemingly unrelated statistics in parking functions recently identified by Stanley and Yin and give an explicit bijection between the two statistics.

 Depth-First Search Performance in Random Digraphs   
 Authors:  Philippe Jacquet and Svante Janson  
  Abstract    
 We present an analysis of the depth-first search algorithm in a random digraph model with independent outdegrees having an arbitrary distribution with finite variance. The results include asymptotics for the distribution of the stack index and depths of the search. The search yields a series of trees of finite size before and after the exploration of a giant tree. Our analysis mainly concerns the giant tree. Most results are first order. This analysis proposed by Donald Knuth in his next to appear volume of The Art of Computer Programming gives interesting insight in one of the most elegant and efficient algorithm for graph analysis due to Tarjan.

 Goals:  The Japanese Society for Bioinformatics (JSBi) was founded in 1999 for promoting researches and educational activities on bioinformatics as well as for promoting the relevant technologies and industries in Japan. JSBi also enhances international collaborations as an affiliated regional group of ISCB (International Society for Computational Biology) and a member of AASBi (Association of Asian Societies for Bioinformatics). In addition, JSBi played a key role in holding the longest running international bioinformatics conference, International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW, former Genome Informatics Workshop), which originated in Japan.  
 Activities:   
  • JSBi annual meeting  
  • JSBi newsletter (2 issues per year)  
  • JSBi Bioinformatics Review  
  • Encyclopedia of bioinformatics (published in 2006)  
  • Bioinformatics introduction textbook  
  • Bioinformatics engineer examination  
  • Bioinformatics education curriculum  
  • Special interest groups and regional meetings  
  • As a founding member of the Association of Asian Societies for Bioinformatics (AASBi), JSBi supports GIW and other international bioinformatics meetings in the years they are held in Japan.  
 Activities and programs that demonstrate the advancement of bioinformatics and computational biology:   
  The most important event of JSBi is the General Meeting, which is held once a year and to which all the members are requested to participate. Until 2006, the General Meeting had been held as a part of an international meeting, GIW (International Conference on Genome Informatics, former Genome Informatics Workshop). Since GIW becomes an official meeting of AASBi from 2007, the General Meetings are held independently in Japan.  
   
  Holding Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Regional Working Groups, presenting Oxford Journals-JSBi Prize, and publishing News Letters and Bioinformatics Reviews are also main activities of JSBi. Other activities include managing Bioinformatics Engineer Examination, developing a standard curriculum for bioinformatics education in universities and graduate schools, and editing the encyclopedia of bioinformatics and bioinformatics introduction textbook (in Japanese). The encyclopedia, written by hundreds of JSBi members and researchers in related areas, was published by Kyoritsu Shuppan. Co. Ltd.

In genomics, these techniques aid in predictive modeling, variant calling, drug discovery, functional genomics, and interpreting complex biological data. They have also been prominent in protein structure prediction, as well as other omics fields such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics.   PROTEIN/RNA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS, PREDICTION AND DESIGN:   Cutting-edge computational methods are revolutionizing our ability to predict and design the structures of proteins and RNA molecules. These advancements hold immense potential for developing new drugs, understanding fundamental biological functions, and creating innovative therapeutics.   PERSONALIZED MEDICINE AND COMPUTATIONAL GENETICS:   Computational approaches are instrumental in analyzing large-scale genomic and clinical data to tailor treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. Precision oncology, in particular, relies on computational biology for tumor profiling, drug sensitivity prediction, and identifying potential therapeutic targets.   METAGENOMICS AND MICROBIOME ANALYSIS:   Computational tools play a crucial role in studying complex microbial communities and their impact on human health, agriculture, and the environment. Analyzing metagenomic data involves developing algorithms for taxonomic classification, functional profiling, and understanding microbial interactions.   NETWORK BIOLOGY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY:   Computational modeling of biological networks, such as protein-protein interactions, metabolic pathways, and gene regulatory networks, helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex biological systems. Systems biology integrates computational and experimental approaches to study biological systems holistically.   DRUG DISCOVERY AND REPURPOSING:   Computational methods are extensively used in virtual screening, molecular docking, and drug-target interaction prediction. These approaches accelerate drug discovery and enable the repurposing of existing drugs for new therapeutic applications.   ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES(ELSI):   With the increasing volume of biological data being generated, there is a growing emphasis on addressing ethical concerns, ensuring data privacy, and developing frameworks for responsible data sharing and usage in computational biology research.   BIOINFORMATICS EDUCATION:   Bioinformatics education is fast advancing by reflecting substantial changes in the expanding research areas and educational tools.   OMICS-Based INFORMATICS:   Various informatics resources and technologies have been developed for omics data accumulated via high-throughput technologies.   DATABASES, ONTOLOGIES AND BIOCURATION:   To effectively manage the vast amounts of biological data generated by advanced measurement techniques, it is increasingly crucial to design interoperable and reusable biological databases, construct ontologies for precise data representation in life sciences, and refine biocuration workflows to enhance data quality and accessibility.   EVOLUTIONARY, COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND PHYLOGENETICS:   New discoveries as well as groundbreaking methods are being made for comparing genomic data and revealing the evolutionary histories and relationships of diverse species.   SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING:   Engineering biology enabling the intentional design, manufacture and deployment of living cells, cell systems, and other biological processes to create materials and products for benefiting humanity.
