  SCOPE  
   
 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER), focuses on the highly important area of Cloud Computing, inspired by some latest advances that concern the infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing.  
 Emerging Enterprise Technologies are profoundly changing the way we think of IT - from economics and efficiency to process and usage models. Many organizations look to the "externalized" IT systems and services as a potential cost-savings advantage by moving internally hosted IT services to external providers. Other organizations view the "external" IT as potential disaster recovery systems or as on-demand capacity to boost business continuity and customer service levels. We need to take a closer look, discerning what emerging enterprise technologies are and how they can catalyze creativity and produce a competitive advantage. There is hence a new wave of interest in 'Externalization of IT' - anything as a service (including Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service), On Demand delivery, outsourcing, edge cloud and so on. This emerging facilitation and way of utilizing services through IT is what we are referring to as Cloud Computing.

 About IC2E  
 The IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)  conference series provides a high-quality and comprehensive forum where researchers and practitioners can exchange information on engineering principles, enabling technologies, and practical experiences as related to Cloud Computing. By bringing together experts that work on different levels of the cloud stack – systems, storage, networking, platforms, databases, analytics, and applications, IC2E offers an end-to-end view on the challenges and technologies in Cloud Computing, fosters research that addresses the interaction between different layers of the stack, and ultimately drives cloud-based innovation in business and society.  
 This year the conference will place a special focus on cloud systems for sustainability and sustainability of cloud systems. Other paper topics remain most welcome, of course.

 IEEE Computer Society Open Conference Statement  
 Equity, diversity, and inclusion are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its conferences. Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed. Diversity is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. Inclusion is the active engagement of diversity and equity.  
 A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination. For this reason, the IEEE Computer Society is firmly committed to team compositions in all sponsored activities, including but not limited to, technical committees, steering committees, conference organizations, standards committees, and ad hoc committees that display equity, diversity, and inclusion.  
 IEEE Computer Society meetings, conferences and workshops must provide a welcoming, open and safe environment, which embraces the value of every person, regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, religion, national origin, ancestry, or disability. All individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination, including harassment based on any of the above factors.  
  
  IEEE Event Conduct and Safety Statement  
 IEEE believes that science, technology, and engineering are fundamental human activities, for which openness, international collaboration, and the free flow of talent and ideas are essential. Its meetings, conferences, and other events seek to enable engaging, thought provoking conversations that support IEEE’s core mission of advancing technology for humanity. Accordingly, IEEE is committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment to all participants, including staff and vendors, at IEEE-related events.  
 IEEE has no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or bullying in any form at IEEE-related events. All participants have the right to pursue shared interests without harassment or discrimination in an environment that supports diversity and inclusion. Participants are expected to adhere to these principles and respect the rights of others.  
 IEEE seeks to provide a secure environment at its events. Participants should report any behavior inconsistent with the principles outlined here, to on site staff, security or venue personnel, or to eventconduct@ieee.org  .

 Download the CfP Document   
 IEEE Cluster 2025 is the 27th edition of the IEEE Cluster conference series. It is being held in cooperation with SIGHPC.  
 Computing clusters remain the primary system architecture for building many of today’s rapidly evolving computing infrastructures including high-performance computing, cloud computing, machine learning training and inference systems, and big data, and are used to solve some of the most complex problems. The challenges posed making them scalable, efficient, productive, and increasingly effective require community efforts in the areas of cluster system design, advancing the capabilities of the software stack, system management and monitoring, and the design of algorithms, methods, and applications to leverage the overall infrastructure.  
 For IEEE Cluster 2025, which will be held September 2-5, 2025 in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, we again solicit high-quality original work that advances the state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields.  
 All papers will be rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical depth and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of presentation. Generally research papers must clearly demonstrate novel research contributions, however papers reporting experiences are also welcome, but they must clearly describe the lessons learned and the resulting impact, along with the utility of the approach in comparison to previous work.  
 Authors must indicate the primary topic area of their submissions from the four topic areas provided below. In addition, they may optionally rank their paper relative to the overall set of topics. Transversal and emerging topics such as AI for HPC, HPC for AI, quantum computing, accelerators, and many others, are welcome within the respective areas even if they are not mentioned explicitly. Papers are limited to 10 pages, although references do not need to fit within this page limit.  
 IEEE Cluster 2025 follows a dual-anonymous  review process. For an explanation and description of this review process, please refer to the following link: https://clustercomp.org/2025/dual_anonymous.html   
 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text   
 The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.  
 The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

 SJR   

 The SJR is a size-independent prestige indicator that ranks journals by their 'average prestige per article'. It is based on the idea that 'all citations are not created equal'. SJR is a measure of scientific influence of journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from It measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is.

 Research at EPCC   
 EPCC is widely recognised for its world-leading research activities in the areas of high performance computing, computational systems, applications, and data science. We work across a number of diverse areas as described in our Research Themes page.  

 Here are recent examples of EPCC’s internationally recognised research at the leading-edge of HPC and Data Science.  

 Strategic Prosperity Partnership with Rolls-Royce  
 Developing the world’s first simulation of a full gas-turbine.  

 EPCC is leading this ambitious and challenging programme of research funded by EPSRC and Rolls-Royce, in partnership with the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of Warwick and the University of Bristol.  
 By 2030, the goal is to work towards the “virtual certification” of aircraft engines by modelling gas turbines in operation. This requires a unique combination of fundamental engineering and computational science research to address a challenge that is well beyond the capabilities of today’s state of the art.

 Software collaborations with the UK Met Office  
 High resolution modelling of local atmospheric conditions to deliver high accuracy weather forecasts.  

 EPCC worked with the Met Office and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to redevelop the LEM model to enable a step change in capability. We ensured the code for the Met Office’s new atmospheric model—MONC—would run on large HPC machines and provide significant efficiency.  
 The model is now routinely used across the UK and wider world, with domains of up to 2.1 billion grid points having been modelled on over 32,768 cores of ARCHER (the UK’s previous national supercomputer service). There have been numerous scientific discoveries made with MONC that would have been untenable with previous-generation models.

 Exascale research  
 EPCC has been involved in various aspects of Exascale research for 10 years.  

 Overview of EPCC's Exascale activities  
 EPCC has been involved in research around the core issues of Exascale computing for over a decade. This "Computing in Science and Engineering" article summarises our efforts, ranging from investigating energy efficiency and programming language interoperability, to application performance and I/O solutions:  
 EPCC's Exascale journey: a retrospective of the past 10 years and a vision of the future 
  ExCALIBUR programme  
 The ExCALIBUR programme is a £45.7M initiative from the UK government’s Strategic Priorities Fund  (SPF) led by the Met Office  , UK Research and Innovation  (UKRI) with the UK Atomic Energy Authority  (UKAEA).  
 The aim is to prepare high priority applications for Exascale and progress cross-cutting domains such as algorithm design to maintain a leading position for the UK in high performance computing. Work is focussed on issues of strategic importance such as drug and vaccine research, climate and weather prediction, and fusion power and green energy sources.  
 EPCC is leading or co-leading the following ExCALIBUR collaborations:  
 The Materials and Molecular Modelling Exascale Design and Development Working Group 
  ELEMENT: the Exascale Mesh Network 
  EXALAT: Lattice Field Theory at the Exascale Frontier 
  Learn more   

 Exploring novel hardware architectures  
 EPCC researches how to exploit novel hardware in order to accelerate numerical and data intensive applications.  

 In recent research, we have explored novel hardware such as byte-addressable persistent memory to accelerate I/O intensive applications, Arm-based CPUs in order to assess the maturity of the surrounding software ecosystem, and FPGAs and AI-accelerator technologies to study alternative technologies to achieve high performance with high efficiency.

 The CNOM flagship conferences are the Network Operations and Management (NOMS) conference, previously named Integrated Management (IM) conference on odd-numbered years, and the Conference on Network and Systems Management (CNSM), a consolidation of the   DSOM, MMNS, IPOM, MACE and NGNM conferences/workshops previously held   during a Management Week (ManWeek) event.  CNOM generally supports “regional” network management conferences: APNOMS, held in the Asia-Pacific region and LANOMS, held in Latin America and AIMS in Europe. Finally, CNOM generally co-sponsors technical symposia in the Comsoc flagship conferences ICC and Globecom. Below are links to these events.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Scope    

 The 45 th  IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss and exchange cutting edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over July 20-23 rd  , 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.  

 Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:  

  Cloud Computing 

  Distributed Algorithms 

  Big Data, Models & Systems 

  Distributed Fault Tolerance 

  Distributed OS and Middleware 

  Edge Computing 

  IoT + CPS 

  Mobile Computing 

  Security, Privacy and Trust 

  Blockchains/Databases 

  Distributed Systems for AI/ML 

  AI/ML for Distributed Systems 

  Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures 

 Paper Submission   

 The Paper strand provides  the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.  

 Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector https://template-selector.ieee.org/  ). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages  (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.  

 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.  

 For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.  

 Note that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics  and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.   

 Note  : A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)  . The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

 The last three CoDIT editions have been technically co-sponsored by three major IEEE societies: ( IEEE Control Systems Society  , IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society  , and IEEE Robotics and Automation Society  ) together with the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)    

 WELCOME  

  Welcome to CoDIT 2025    
  T he CoDIT 2025  conference is the eleventh ( 11 th   ) edition in the series of the International Conference on Co  ntrol, D  ecision and I  nformation T  echnologies, organized since 2013, the previous one CoDIT 2024  was held in Valletta, Malta, in July 2024.    
 CoDIT 2025  will be held 15  -18 July, 2025  at Split, Croatia  . The conference serves as a forum for technical exchange among scientists interested in Control, Automation, Robotics, Optimization, Decision, Cybernetics, Computer Science, and Information Technologies. It offers an exceptional platform for both academic and industrial communities to tackle new challenges, share solutions, and explore future research directions. The program will feature plenary lectures, regular technical sessions, and special sessions.   
  Welcome to Split, Croatia    
 Split, located on Croatia’s stunning Dalmatian coast, is a vibrant city that seamlessly blends ancient history with a lively, modern atmosphere. Known for its breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea, Split is centered around the UNESCO-listed Diocletian's Palace, a massive, well-preserved Roman structure dating back to the 4th century.   
 Walking through its maze of stone streets, visitors encounter a unique mix of ancient ruins, bustling marketplaces, cozy cafes, and contemporary art galleries, giving Split a charm that appeals to both history enthusiasts and modern travelers. The city’s waterfront promenade, Riva, is the social heart of Split. With its palm-lined paths, lively restaurants, and bars, it’s an ideal spot for both locals and visitors to relax and enjoy scenic views of the harbor.   
    
 Nearby, Marjan Hill offers hiking trails with panoramic views of the city, coast, and nearby islands. Split’s beaches, such as Bačvice, are a popular draw, offering both sandy and rocky spots to unwind by the crystal-clear Adriatic waters. Split is also a gateway to Croatia’s idyllic islands, such as Hvar, Brač, and Vis, making it a top destination for island hopping and maritime adventures. With its perfect blend of cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and lively atmosphere, Split captures the essence of Croatia, offering visitors a memorable and diverse experience.

  IEEE Transactions On Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (TCAD) 
  TCAD Paper Submission Instructions 

 TCAD Paper Submission Instructions   

 The IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD) is published monthly. Manuscripts considered for publication should focus on algorithms, methods, techniques, and tools for the automated design of integrated circuits and systems, and on related areas. Submitted papers may be of a survey or research nature. Research papers must present original contributions and must show significant new material over descriptions or derivations available elsewhere. Survey papers are only by invitation, and should review the state-of-the-art in specific CAD fields and, at the same time, provide the readers with research perspectives and future challenges in the considered topic. Proposals for the organization of special issues are not allowed in TCAD; they are only by invitation.  
 The IEEE must of necessity assume that material submitted for publication is available for general dissemination. It is the responsibility of the Author, not the IEEE, to determine whether disclosure of their material requires the prior consent of other parties and if so, to obtain it.  

 A. Process for Submission of a Manuscript    
 Only electronic submissions will be considered. Papers should be submitted at https://ieee.atyponrex.com/journal/tcad   

 B. Style for Submission of Manuscript    
 All manuscripts must be formatted using the IEEE two-column format. Style templates can be found at | http://www.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org | . (Minimum font size is 10 pt). 
  The maximum number of pages allowed for submissions is: | Regular Papers: 14 pages 
  Transactions Brief Papers: 5 pages 
  Submitted papers that are not compliant with either the style format or the allowed page lengths will be returned to the Author. 
  The manuscript should include an informative 100- to 250-word abstract, at the head of the manuscript, which will appear with the paper. Index terms and 4-to-8 keywords describing the manuscript are also required. 
  References should appear in a separate bibliography section at the end of the paper, with items referred to by numerals in square brackets, e.g., [12]. In either case, references should be complete and in IEEE style. | Style for papers: Author, first initial(s) followed by last name, title, volume, including page numbers, month, and year. 
  Style for books: Author, title, location and publisher, year, chapter or page numbers (if desired). 
  Guideline for final manuscript preparation: Detailed instructions for preparation of the final manuscript is in the | Author guidelines for final manuscript preparation | . 

 C. Graphical Abstract    
 This journal accepts graphical abstracts and they must be peer-reviewed. For more information about graphical abstracts and their specifications, please visit the following link: http://www.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/   

 D. Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)    
 All IEEE journals require an Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)  for all authors. ORCIDs enable accurate attribution and improved discoverability of an author’s published work. The author will need a registered ORCID in order to submit a manuscript or review a proof in this journal.  
 Follow these steps to link a ScholarOne account to a registered ORCID:  
 Login to ScholarOne and click on your name in the top row of the screen. 
  Click E-mail / Name in the dropdown menu. 
  In the ORCID section at the top of the page, click the appropriate link to either register for a new ORCID or associate the account with an existing ORCID. 
  A new page will open to create and/or validate your ORCID. Once the validation is complete, the new page will close and you will return to ScholarOne. 
  Save the changes to your ScholarOne user account. 
  Authors who do not have an ORCID in their ScholarOne user account will be prompted to provide one during submission.  

 E. Disclosure of Previous Submissions    
 Authors should disclose versions of this paper that were already peer-reviewed for publications in other journals and conferences within the past two years, immaterial of the outcome.  
 If an earlier version of this paper was rejected by a different publication or conference, please provide information on how reviewer and editor comments from that review were handled. This can also include remarks that point out disagreements of the author's viewpoint with review comments from other publications.  
 If an earlier version of the paper has been accepted for conference/workshop publication or has already appeared in a conference/workshop proceeding, the authors should clearly identify the substantive improvement over the earlier conference/workshop version.  
 The material in this submission should be at least 30% different in content from any prior accepted/published version, but it is up to the review process to determine whether the additional contributions are substantive. Examples of substantive enhancements include modifications/enhancements to algorithms, improvements in evaluation methodology, new insights from additional benchmarks. Examples of additional content that does not contribute to the 30% requirement include (but is not limited to): an expanded literature review or a broadening of the introductory or background material usually does not count towards the 30% requirement.  
 Concurrent submissions of any kind (journal, conference, workshop) to this Journal are not allowed and no extensions of any previously published journal version will be accepted.  
 If a submission has no previous peer-reviewed versions, it should clearly state this on the cover page.  

 F. Policy on Self-Plagiarism    
 IEEE Publications has long indicated that verbatim copying another's work (plagiarism) is unacceptable author conduct. Moreover, the IEEE Board of Directors approved in November 2002 a new policy on Duplicate Publication and Self-Plagiarism. This policy is included in the IEEE Policies document, precisely in Sections 6.4.1B(f) and 6.4.1B(h). These two sections are indicated next:  
 (f) Plagiarism is unacceptable. The verbatim copying or reuse of one's own research) as indicated in paragraph "h" below) is considered another form of plagiarism or self-plagiarism; it is unacceptable. 
  (h) Except as indicated in Section 6.3.4 (Multiple Publication of Original Technical Material in IEEE Periodicals), authors should only submit original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication nor which is under review for another refereed publication. If authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a basis for a new submission, they are required to cite the previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new submission offers substantial novel contributions beyond those of the previously published work(s). 
  As a result, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS will carefully monitor possible self-plagiarism conducts. As a result, it will not accept for review manuscripts where a significant portion of the text is a verbatim copy of the text already published in previous works. In particular, as general requirements:  
   
 The submission material shall not have more than 40% total text overlap percentage with prior accepted/published versions of the work. 
  The authors need to include both in their cover page of the submission material and in the text of the manuscript (e.g., related work section) a clear and concise statement about the contribution of the submitted paper with respect to each of their prior relevant works. The manuscript's statement must refer to the appropriate citation(s) of the authors' previous work(s). 

 G. Review Process    
 The IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS publishes only peer-reviewed papers. The Editor will assign each submitted manuscript to an Associate Editor, who will rely on anonymous reviews to decide on the acceptance of the paper, on mandatory modifications, and on the publication in full or short form. The Author is responsible for checking the galley proofs prior to publication.  
 The articles in this journal are peer-reviewed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual  . Each published article was reviewed by a minimum of two independent reviewers using a single-anonymous peer-review process, where the identities of the reviewers are not known to the authors, but the reviewers know the identities of the authors. Articles will be screened for plagiarism before acceptance.  

 H. Open Access    
 This publication is a hybrid journal, allowing either Traditional manuscript submission or Open Access (author-pays OA) manuscript submission. Upon submission, if you choose to have your manuscript be an Open Access article, you commit to paying the discounted $2,645 OA fee if your manuscript is accepted for publication in order to enable unrestricted public access. Any other applicable charges (such as over-length page charge and/or charge for the use of color in the print format) will be billed separately once the manuscript formatting is complete but prior to the publication. If you would like your manuscript to be a Traditional submission, your article will be available to qualified subscribers and purchasers via IEEE Xplore. No OA payment is required for Traditional submission.  

 I. Page Charges    
  After a manuscript has been accepted for publication, the Author’s institution will be approached with a request to pay a voluntary charge of $110 per page to cover part of the cost of publication. If the voluntary page charge is not honored, IEEE will charge a mandatory page charge of $175 per page for each page in excess of 9. Detailed instructions will accompany the page proofs. The color charge fee structure has been simplified to a flat $275 per printed color figure.  

 J. Copyright    
 It is the policy of the IEEE to own the copyright to the technical contributions it publishes. To comply with IEEE copyright policy, Authors are required to sign an IEEE Copyright Transfer Form before publication in either the print or electronic medium. Authors must submit a signed copy of this form with their manuscript.

 Keynotes  

 Theme 1:  The Future of Foundational Ideas of Cognitive Science    
 Cognitive Science was born from a revolution that centered the mind as the object of study, resulting in new fields that study the nature of mental representations, consciousness, the origins of knowledge, and how the brain carries out mental computations. Which of the foundational ideas and debates that emerged from the Cognitive Revolution remain important to current discourse in our field?   

 Keynote: Susan Carey  
 Harvard University  
   
 Carey investigates the origins of human conceptual representation and has conducted work on core systems of knowledge, word learning, the construction of intuitive theories, and case studies of conceptual change including number, causal reasoning, and the language of thought. Among her most important contributions is the argument that human knowledge emanates from rich innate structures that are enriched through processes of conceptual change.  

 Theme 2: The Role of AI in Theories of the Future   
 The rapid emergence of AIs and their success in modeling diverse aspects of human language and cognition raises important questions about the future of theory building in our field. Do the engineering successes of AI suggest a new theoretical path forward for Cognitive Science? What role should foundational ideas in Cognitive Science play in theory making as we look to the future?  

 Keynote: Josh Tenenbaum  
 MIT  
   
 Tenenbaum’s work investigates the computational structure of human cognition, and includes studies of concept learning, similarity judgment, causal inference, and the formation of perceptual representations. A key focus is the nature and origin of common-sense theories, and how humans construct concepts, theories and skills from minimal examples.  

 Theme 3: New Theoretical Horizons in Cognitive Science   
 What is the future of theory in the Cognitive Sciences? In this transitional moment in Cognitive Science, what questions are most central to understanding human cognition? Which of the foundational theoretical constructs of our field deserve to be preserved in the coming years? What changes are required? What paths are most likely to lead to innovation and discovery?  

 Keynote: Lauren Ross  
 UC Irvine  
   
 Ross specializes in the philosophy of science, focusing on explanation and causation within biology, neuroscience, and medicine. Her research includes projects that explore the nature of scientific explanation, the variety of causal structures and types of explanation used in these fields, and the underlying rationale for specific forms of causal reasoning. By investigating how scientists explain phenomena and infer causal relationships, her work addresses the conceptual foundations of empirical research in the life sciences and medicine.  

 2025 Recipient of the Rumelhart Prize    

 Nora Newcombe  
 Temple University  
   
 Nora S. Newcombe (Ph.D., Harvard), is Laura H. Carnell Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. Her research in cognition and cognitive development centers on spatial cognition and episodic memory, along with translational work on STEM education. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. Past honors include the Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award from SRCD, the William James Fellow Award from APS, the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from SEP, and the Award for Distinguished Service to Psychological Science from APA.   

 The Cognitive Science Society is pleased to announce the establishment of the CogSci Grove which aims to mobilise cognitive scientists to offset carbon emissions associated with their professional activities.

 Future Conferences  

 Cogsci 2025  
 Theories of the Past, Theories of the Future   
 Location: San Francisco, CA, USA   
   Dates: July 30 – August 2, 2025   
    
 PROGRAM CHAIRS

 Format Cycle   
 The Cognitive Science Society plans to host a fully synchronous hybrid conference every 3 years  , starting in 2025. In the other years, the conference will be in-person. The Governing Board, with guidance from the Conference Committee and the Hybridisation Committee, approved this plan after a great deal of discussion, briefly described below:   
    
 Rationale:    
  Since COVID in 2020, the Cognitive Science Society has been discussing how best to run its annual conference. The conference landscape has also been altered by changes in technology, shifting conference norms, visa issues, several major world events, and greater attention to accessibility and the climate crisis. The pandemic allowed the Society to experiment with various types of virtual conference offerings, from being online in 2020 and 2021, to being fully hybrid conference in 2022, and streaming from only the main conference room in 2023.   
 Throughout this process, we have gotten feedback from our members about their conference experiences, including very positive feedback on our 2022 synchronous hybrid conference in Toronto. We have also examined logistic constraints, our finances and conference budget. While conference expenses have allowed us to break even in the past, our hybrid conference in 2022 and semi-hybrid conference in 2023 resulted in a substantial financial loss for the society.   
 The three-year cycle will allow us to financially and logistically sustain conferences into the future, while offering a fully hybrid experience on a regular basis.   

 Location cycle   
 The three-year location cycle for the annual conference is:   
 1: Western Europe  
  2: US or Canada  
  3: Anywhere else in the world, with a preference for locations that would serve emerging cognitive science communities and that have not previously had a CogSci conference in the vicinity. Possible destinations include Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.  

 The Cognitive Science Society is pleased to announce the establishment of the CogSci Grove which aims to mobilise cognitive scientists to offset carbon emissions associated with their professional activities.

 Our History  

 Society Creation  
 The Society was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit professional organization in Massachusetts in 1979  . The organizing committee included Roger Schank, Allan Collins, Donald Norman, and a number of other scholars from psychology, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy.  

 Conference creation  
 The first conference on cognitive science was held at LaJolla, California in August, 1979, and has occurred annually since then. The proceedings of each conference are published, and those from most years are available through Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. The annual proceedings of the Cognitive Science Conference represent a major source of information on new work and new ideas in the scientific study of thinking. In 1990, the Society, with help from an anonymous donor, established the David Marr Prize for the best student paper at each annual meeting.  

 Journal creation  
 The Journal, Cognitive Science, began publication in 1976, and is now published by Wiley-Blackwell. The Executive Editor is currently Richard P. Cooper of Birkbeck, University of London, and there are 18 Associate Editors and a 30-member editorial board. It serves as the premier outlet for research reports that intersect two or more disciplines. Copyrights for articles published in the journal are held by the Society. The Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society voted in late 2006 to found a new journal, Topics in Cognitive Science (topiCS). The Editor in Chief is Wayne Gray, Cognitive Science Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The journal seeks to fill a niche not occupied by Cognitive Science Journal or other cognitive science journals. Membership in the Society includes a subscription to Cognitive Science and TopiCS. Copyrights for articles published in the journal are held by the Society.  
 Historical information may be found via a search in the Massachusetts registry   .  

 Society bylaws  
 ARTICLE 1: NAME AND OBJECTIVE  
 The name of the Society is The Cognitive Science Society, Inc. The objectives of the Society are to promote Cognitive Science as a discipline and to foster scientific interchange among researchers in the Cognitive Sciences.  
  
 ARTICLE 2: MEMBERSHIP  
 Society membership is open to anyone engaged in scientific endeavors related to Cognitive Science. The Society retains the right to refuse membership to applicants for any or no reason.  
 The Governing Board will establish membership types, length & term of membership (i.e. one-year, two-year lengths, Jan 1 – Dec 31 terms), and membership dues. A member failing to pay dues shall, unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, be considered to have resigned from the Society.  
  
 ARTICLE 3: GOVERNING BOARD  
 3.1  Objective: The Governing Board shall exercise general supervision over the affairs of the Society, subject to these Bylaws, as amended from time to time. The Governing Board shall have full and plenary power to conduct all business, undertake all activities, set all policies, and otherwise govern and control the operations of the Society. The Governing Board’s powers include, without limitation, the ability to conduct, control, or direct the following activities:  
 Setting all policies and practices 
  Conducting all business regarding publications

  The Governing Board has the ability and power to conduct any or all of its activities on its own behalf, or through delegates, committees, contractors, agents, or otherwise; delegated powers may be withdrawn or limited at any time at the sole discretion of the Governing Board.  
 3.2  The Governing Board shall consist of fifteen members (subject to the terms of these Bylaws), elected for staggered terms of six years each. Elected members of the Governing Board may not succeed themselves unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board or as provided in these Bylaws, such as in Sections 3.4 or 5.4. Upon request of the Governing Board, an Officer or Officers shall serve for an additional period of time on the Board as may be required to provide continuity with new Officers.  
 3.3  The Governing Board will on an ongoing basis appoint a non-voting Graduate Student Representative to the Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society, to serve a 2-year term. The Graduate Student Representative may participate in assigned committees and is expected to attend the annual meeting and Governing Board meetings.  
 3.4  Method of Election of Elected Representatives: The President is selected from among current Governing Board members and is elected by the Governing Board. Each elected President will serve for three years, where the first year is served as “President-Elect”, the second as President, and the third as “Past President”. The President may not serve two consecutive terms. The President must be a member of the Governing Board at the time he or she becomes President-Elect. The term of the President as a member of the Governing Board shall be extended if necessary, to cover the whole of their period as President-Elect, President, and Past President. The President shall preside at meetings of the Governing Board and at the Annual Business Meeting.  
 3.5  Committee Appointments: The Governing Board shall from time to time appoint such committees as it deems necessary to conduct the affairs of the Society.  
  
 ARTICLE 4: OFFICERS  
 4.1  The officers of the Society shall be (a) the President, (b) the President-Elect, (c) the Past President, (d) the Treasurer, and (e) the Executive Officer.  
 4.2  The Treasurer of the Society shall be the President of the Finance Committee. The Treasurer shall be elected by the Governing Board.  
 4.3  The Executive Officer shall be elected by the Governing Board to serve a term of three years. The Governing Board may remove the current Executive Officer by a majority vote, at any time and with termination to be effective on a date set by the Governing Board. There shall be no fixed limit on the number of terms the Executive Officer may serve. The Executive Officer shall be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Society as directed by the Governing Board. The Executive Officer is expected to attend and participate in all meetings of the Governing Board, but the Executive Officer is not a member of the Governing Board and may not vote upon any matters before the Governing Board.  
  
 ARTICLE 5: ELECTIONS  
 5.1  Once each year, the Executive Officer shall canvass the membership for nominations of members to serve on the Governing Board. A nominee must have been a member of the Society for at least 3 (not necessarily consecutive) years.  
 5.2  Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, the nominations committee of the Governing Board will select candidates for election by choosing among those nominated by the membership up to a total of three times the number of vacancies, and present the candidates in a report to the Governing Board for approval. Once the full Governing Board has approved the report of the nominations committee, the names shall be placed on an election ballot, which shall be circulated to all members.  
 5.3  Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, twenty-one (21) days after the circulation of the election ballot, the election shall be closed, and the ballots counted. The members receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected to fill the vacancies on the Governing Board. In case of ties, the then-current President of the Governing Board shall cast the deciding ballot.  
 5.4  Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, in the case of resignation, recall, or death of a member of the Governing Board, the resulting special vacancy shall be filled in conformity with Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this Article above, at the time of the next scheduled election. The special vacancies shall be filled last, with the nominees receiving the most votes filling the regular vacancies. Members elected to fill special vacancies shall only serve the unfilled term of office of that vacancy. However, those members are then eligible for re-election. In the event of a vacancy of one year or less, the Governing Board may appoint a member to serve the unfilled term.  
 5.5  Each year, if there is no non-North American member of the Governing Board whose term on the Governing Board extends beyond that year, then one seat on the Governing Board will be designated for a non-North American member, who will be elected in conformity with Sections 1, 2, and 3 above, provided that nominations and candidates shall be limited to members not residing in North America, or meeting such other criteria as the Governing Board may designate.  
  
 ARTICLE 6: ELECTION RECALL  
 Upon petition of 10% of the membership, or if otherwise approved by the Governing Board, an election will be held on proposals for the recall of one or more members of the Governing Board.

International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE), co-located with AAMAS 2020   
 Call for Papers   Paper Submissions   Committees   Accepted for Presentation   Technical Programme   Contact    
  
  Note:  The workshop proceedings of COIN 2017 and COINE 2020 have been published as a combined Springer LNCS volume and are available via SpringerLink  .  
 Objectives  
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.  
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a “good” society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (12 times), IJCAI, AAAI and ECAI since 2006 (see COIN Series Website  ), and produced 12 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. While operating in the tradition of the COIN workshop series, this edition of the workshop adds ethics to the workshop name and acronym as an explicit focus of the workshop, and includes governance of MAS in the workshop name to highlight this as the common objective uniting the various strands of research of interest to the workshop.  
 Note:  COINE will inherit COIN’s B-rating on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  .  
 This edition of COINE will be hosted by AAMAS 2020  and will complement the main conference program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Under its new COINE brand, this workshop will not only be of interest to its traditional sub-community of AAMAS participants (those researchers working on coordination, organisational, institutional and normative models and technologies for MAS), but also invites researchers investigating the growing field of ethical governance of MAS.

 Overview  
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a “good” society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (12 times), IJCAI, AAAI and ECAI since 2006 (see Workshop Series Website  ), and produced 12 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.  
 Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.  
 We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:  
 mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical and pragmatic issues related to the issues above; 
  modelling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS; 
  tools, prototypes and actual working systems; 
  experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies; 
  challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field. 
  The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration among researchers in these topics.  
 A specific emphasis of this year’s iteration of COINE lies on the response to the wider uptake of COINE technologies within and across AAMAS communities, such as social robotics and reinforcement learning. To leverage a broader understanding on how COINE-related themes are employed in these research disciplines, we will invite established researchers from the respective fields in order to highlight their perspectives on and adoption of COINE theory and technologies. Building on those insights, we will use this workshop to provide a platform to discuss the potentially varying viewpoints and facilitate the exploration of synergies as well as opportunities for cross-fertilisation across community boundaries.  
 COINE inherits COIN’s B-rating on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  . COIN holds a B4 rating by the Qualis ranking from CAPES (Brazil).

There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.  
 This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (15 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI in 2008 and ECAI in 2006 and 2016 (see COIN Series Website  ), and produced 14 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (see COIN Proceedings  ). The 15th volume of COINE post-proceedings is in progress. In 2020, ethics was added to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken. The workshop in the new format has been held three times (2020, 2021, and 2022). COINE has achieved a ranking of B on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/  .

 A specific emphasis of this year’s iteration of COINE lies on the response to growing interest in the concept of norms applied to social and human-centric AI, so we will also aim to establish better mutual awareness between COINE and that community by making explicit references in our scope for research in development methodologies and education of trustworthy AI.

 We solicit three types of papers in the LNCS format  :  
 Full research papers (16 pages, excluding references) 
  Short research papers (10 pages, excluding references) – These ‘early-innovation’ papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea. 
  Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2023 (see | https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/calls/blue-sky-ideas/ | ), focussing on the COINE topics 
  All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).    
 For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2023   
 Submitted papers will be reviewed on a “single-blind” basis by at least two reviewers.  
 Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work.  
 Proceedings  
 Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference. They will also be distributed to AAMAS 2023 registrants in electronic form.  
 As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer’s LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.  
 Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.

 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).

 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024

 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

 Where Cognitive Science meets Computer Science The CogSIMA conference series provides the premier venue for discussing complex heterogeneous dynamical systems - of interacting humans, machines, and computer agents - whose collective behavior depends on their cognitive capabilities to comprehend, explain, predict and act upon the surrounding operational situations. Adhering to its successful interdisciplinary tradition, CogSIMA 2025 will provide a stimulating forum for scientists and practitioners from diverse backgrounds to advance the field of cognitive situation management, supported by the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society's Technical Committees on Cognitive Situation Management and Interactive and Wearable Computing and Devices. We aim to bring together researchers from computer science, human factors, cognitive science and artificial intelligence, modeling and simulation, robotics, systems engineering, and related areas, to progress towards this ambitious goal. Application areas include autonomous vehicles, command and control systems, disaster monitoring and recovery systems, human-robot teams, human-AI teaming, physical and cyber security situation awareness and cyber warfare systems, intelligent transportation systems, health care medical situation control systems, and many others. For questions concerning CogSIMA 2025 contact us at admin@cogsima.org. We look forward to seeing you in Duisburg! Please consult www.cogsima2025.org for the most recent updates. Topics of Interest Situation sensing, perception, comprehension, and prediction “Big Data” analysis and social media processing for situation awareness Cognitive information fusion Integration of human and signal intelligence, cyber-physical-social systems Models of collaboration and emergent behavior in cognitive multiagent systems Situation recognition in autonomous systems and autonomous vehicles Situation assessment in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning Generative AI and Explainable AI for situation awareness and situated human-machine interaction Cognitive Situation Management with Neuroergonomics and Brain-Machine Interface Biologically-inspired computational models of situation management Approaches to spatial and temporal reasoning, reasoning about goals, intentions and actions Models of human-machine collaboration Performance evaluation and metrics of human- machine systems including human-AI teaming Ontology-based computing, context modeling and discovery, situation modeling, representation and identification Systems, platforms and tools for situation awareness, situation control, and decision support System-level experiments and application-specific research  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-10-13

  The Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems  book series        
 The COINE Steering Committee | Multi-agent systems are often understood as complex entities where a multitude of agents interact, usually with some intended individual or collective purpose. Such a view usually assumes some form of structure  , or set of norms  or conventions  that articulate or restrain interactions in order to make them more effective in attaining those goals, more certain for participants or more predictable. The engineering of effective regulatory mechanisms is a key problem for the design of open complex multi-agent systems.  
 In recent years, social  and organizational  aspects of agency have become a major issue in MAS research. Moreover recent applications of MAS on Web Services, Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing enforce the need for using these aspects in order to ensure social order within these environments. Openness heterogeneity, and scalability of MAS pose new demands on traditional MAS interaction models. The view of coordination  and control  has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal  and organization-centric  views as well.  
 Following a series of very successful events in the last years, the topics of coordination  , organization  , institutions  , norms  and ethics  have become an important area of research within the agent community. The overall problem of analyzing the social, legal, economic and technological dimensions of agent organizations, and the co-evolution of agent interactions, provide theoretically demanding and interdisciplinary research questions at different levels of abstraction.  
 In order to reach different research communities working in these related topics, some of the researchers that were working in the field have decided to create the COINE  workshop series. This workshop series will provide a space for the convergence of concerns and developments from MAS researchers that have been involved with these issues from the complementary perspectives of coordination, organizations institutions and norms. Aditionally, the series will facilitate and coordinate the organization of twin yearly events co-located with large international conferences, diverse in focus and geographically.

 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024

 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.

 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.
