30th November to 4th December 2024  
  Meanjin | Brisbane, Australia   

 Welcome to OzCHI 2024  
 Latest:  The conference has begun! Tag your conference photos and posts with #OzCHI2024. The conference dinner will be at the Rivershed, Howard Smith Wharves  .   
 OzCHI 2024 is the 36th Australian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. This annual non-profit event is for the Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest Group (CHISIG) and serves as a premier forum for the latest advancements in HCI research and practice. This year's event will be hosted in Brisbane, Australia, from 30 November to 4 December 2024.  
 OzCHI is Australasia's leading forum for cutting-edge HCI research and practice. It attracts a diverse international community of researchers, industry practitioners, academics, and students. Participants come from over 25 countries and various fields, including interaction design, user experience, information architecture, software engineering, human factors, information systems analysis, and social sciences. We welcome and encourage international and industry submissions and participation.  
 Theme  Beyond Being Human  
 This year’s conference theme Beyond Being Human reflects the continuing debate about how HCI extends beyond designing with and for humans, to include non-human agents from the natural and artificial realms.  
 Venue  The University of Queensland, St Lucia Campus  
 The venue for OzCHI 2024 is the University of Queensland’s main campus in St Lucia. The entire conference will take place in the Advanced Engineering Building  , which borders the recently renovated UQ Lakes  precinct, with the single paper presentation track taking place in the GHD Auditorium  . Brisbane’s integrated public transit system will offer conference participants multiple options for arriving on campus from city centre venues and accommodation, with the CityCat  river ferries a popular choice.

  The 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2025)   
 Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  
 AST continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. This year AST is the 6th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on: i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice; ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques; iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.  
 Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2025 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal

 Scope   
 Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers.

However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes and methods keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA).

 The Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. In 2025, AST is in its 6th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field.

  Hybrid event: Towards a History of British HCI 

 Hybrid event: Towards a History of British HCI  
  
 A seminar on the speaker's recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK.  
 Speaker  
 Elisabetta Mori  
 Agenda  
 2:30pm - Welcome  
  4:30pm - End  
 Synopsis  
 The seminar will share with the public the speaker’s recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK, enhanced by a series of new oral history interviews with academics and practitioners in the field. The history of British HCI is rich: Brian Shackel’s article Ergonomics for a Computer, published as early as 1959, is considered one of the first articles in the history of HCI. From the 1970s onwards several British centres in the UK focused on HCI research and development such as the Man-Machine Interaction Group at the NPL and the HUSAT at the University of Loughborough, among many others.  
 The BCS Specialist Group on Human-Computer Interaction was established in 1984, playing a role in the development of the field in the UK and in connecting with the international community. The British HCI conference was one of the main early international conferences that shaped the discipline, while the Alvey Programme, driven by industrial priorities, influenced and gave strength to HCI in the UK.  
 This research was supported by the Archives of IT and the History of Computing Collection, Swansea University, and by a grant from the Worshipful Company of Information Technologies.

 Bioelectronic devices for continuous monitoring of protein biomarkers  

 Shana Kelley, Northwestern University   
 To put disease-related biomarkers to work for personalized monitoring of health and disease, new high-performance technologies are needed to enable rapid and sensitive analysis of proteins and other biomarkers. Electrochemical methods providing low cost and direct biomarker readout have attracted a great deal of attention for this application. Recently we developed reagentless sensors that are powerful detectors for in vivo protein sensing (Nature Chemistry, 2021, J. am. Chem. Soc. 2023, Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 2023) as well as the analysis of viral particles in situ in the oral cavity (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021). This talk will summarize the development of these sensors, their application to a variety of clinical problems, and the development of a range of implantable sensors for in vivo monitoring.  

 Developing Sustainable Point-of-Care Sensors to Support Newborn Health in Low-Resource Settings  
  
 Rebecca Richards-Kortum, Rice University   
 Neonatal conditions are the leading cause of death in low-income countries and the leading cause of lost years of life across sub-Saharan Africa. Every year, 1.1 million African newborns die. Most of these deaths could be prevented if front-line hospitals in every single district could provide quality care to small and sick newborns. This talk will describe how clinicians and engineers in the NEST360 (Newborn Essential Solutions & Technologies) program are working to develop and roll out point-of-care sensors to detect and monitor critical newborn conditions designed for use in low-resource settings. NEST360 is partnering with African governments to implement a package of care to improve newborn survival in district hospitals, including: Delivering and maintaining a bundle of rugged, effective devices for newborn care; Educating clinicians and biomedical technicians to use and maintain devices; Implementing evidence-based care for small and sick newborns using locally owned dashboards to track and improve quality of care; and Catalyzing country-led change and investment to strengthen newborn care and technology management policies to promote equitable scaling and sustainability. NEST360 implemented the NEST360 package for ~90,000 babies annually admitted to the newborn wards at a learning network of 67 hospitals across Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, and Nigeria. Evidence from NEST360 shows that when facilities increased coverage of interventions, especially for preterm babies, newborn death rates were >20% lower. Lessons to be shared from the NEST360 network include current clinical gaps that could be addressed with novel sensors, as well as pathways to translation and scale of novel, low-cost sensors.  

 Industry Panel Keynotes  

 Transforming Smart Devices into Life-Saving Systems  
  
 Jake Sunshine, Google   
 Unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a persistent public health challenge and barrier to time-sensitive intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Witness status, whereby a cardiac arrest event is directly observed, is a strong and independent predictor of survival given the enormous prognostic role of time and the ability of a human to activate an emergency response. Up to three quarters of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events, however, are unwitnessed, amounting to millions of deaths worldwide, many in individuals deprived of an opportunity for meaningful resuscitation because, simply, no one knows they need help. Minimizing the time from collapse to intervention is the foundation of successful resuscitation and represents the first key link in the OHCA chain of survival. In unwitnessed OHCA scenarios, consumer wearable devices represent a compelling means to detect signs of arrest and summon help when a user is unresponsive and no witness is present. Leveraging these devices’ embedded optical and motion sensors to measure physiology consistent with OHCA, and their communication capabilities to call first responders, presents an opportunity to convert unwitnessed OHCA events into functionally witnessed events, presenting a new paradigm for OHCA detection and more efficient resuscitation.  

 Soft Wearable Systems with Integrated Microfluidics and Biosensors for Remote Hydration Management  
  
 Roozbeh Ghaffari, Northwestern University   
 Dehydration has many harmful effects on cognitive and physical performance as well as physiological function, in the context of sports, industrial work, clinical rehabilitation, and military theater. Because sweat and electrolyte losses vary across individuals, conventional sweat testing strategies using absorbent patch techniques are employed in laboratory settings to characterize sweat biomarkers and hydration needs; however, these conventional techniques are not suitable for remote environments. Here, we present a wearable microfluidic sweat-sensing platform that incorporates colorimetric sensors and electrochemical sensing across a broad range of sweating rates, electrolytes, metabolites, hormones, and proteins, in tandem with biophysical sensing capabilities. Expansive field trials were conducted in sports, industrial safety, and medical applications, showing significant correlations between these advanced microfluidic sensors and conventional techniques and the utility of this platform to impact outcomes in remote care.

 The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)  

 BMVC 2024  : We are pleased to announce that BMVC will be held from 25th - 28th November 2024 in Glasgow. The timeline for the conference is now available  and the paper submission deadline will be 23:59 GMT Friday, 10 May 2024  . Please note, there will be no extension on the paper submission deadline.   
 BMVC 2024 Website   
 Call for Volunteers for hosting and organsing BMVC!  
 We are seeking volunteers to host and form the organising team for BMVC.  
 BMVC is a flagship conference and important conference for the global computer vision community; as such it is a priorty for the BMVA. The conference can only run with support of the vision community; the organisational teams include junior and senior researchers across both academia and industry from the UK and around the world.  
 The vision community, and the size of the conference, has expanded over recent years and we currently plan for around 500 attendees. This places a strain on the old model of hosting within a university with a team entirely from the same university. Instead, BMVC has moved to a model where the conference is split with general chairs comprising a local chair and a programme chair. The local chair is responsible for overseeing the physical hosting of the conference and the programme chair for the selection of the papers (appointing area chairs and reviewers, etc…). These chairs lead teams of volunteers who do not need to be at the same institution and we encourage forming a diverse team from across the global vision community.  
 The BMVA committee can assist with finding and securing venues if this is required (the scale of BMVC can now make it difficult to host within a university lecture theatre for example) and we can provide assistance with putting together the budget and sponsorship.  
 Proposals to Host a Future BMVC  
 If you would like to host BMVC, proposals are solicited in June of each year for the BMVC two years later. Please contact the Chair  for further details.

 AGENDA  
 14:30 - Welcome  
 16:30 - End  

 SYNOPSIS  
 The seminar will share with the public the speaker’s recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK, enhanced by a series of new oral history interviews with academics and practitioners in the field. The history of British HCI is rich: Brian Shackel’s article Ergonomics for a Computer, published as early as 1959, is considered one of the first articles in the history of HCI. From the 1970s onwards several British centres in the UK focused on HCI research and development such as the Man-Machine Interaction Group at the NPL and the HUSAT at the University of Loughborough, among many others. The BCS Specialist Group on Human-Computer Interaction was established in 1984, playing a role in the development of the field in the UK and in connecting with the international community. The British HCI conference was one of the main early international conferences that shaped the discipline, while the Alvey Programme, driven by industrial priorities, influenced and gave strength to HCI in the UK.  
 This research was supported by the Archives of IT and the History of Computing Collection, Swansea University, and by a grant from the Worshipful Company of Information Technologies.

 Reviewing Process for BMVC 2024  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarising the reviewers’ points and recommending paper decisions.  
 Please Note:  Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2024 (based on recent year’s experience), there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., NeurIPS  , CVPR  ) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment, and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection.   
 Further information about the reviewing process can be found at the Reviewing policies  .  
 Any queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to programme-chairs@bmvc2024.org  .

  Calls for Hosting CHI PLAY 2027 and Beyond 

 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”.  
   Apply to Volunteer Today!    

 October 13-16 2025  
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

CPM Archive  
 The purpose of this page is to serve as a repository of the presentations and other electronic material related to the Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM) conferences. Combinatorial Pattern Matching addresses issues of searching  , indexing  and matching  strings and more complicated structures such as trees, regular expressions, graphs, point sets, arrays, etc. The goal is to derive non-trivial combinatorial properties for such structures and then to exploit these properties in order to achieve improved performance for the corresponding computational problem.  
 The first CPM conference was held in Paris in 1990. Since then the conference has been organized annually.

 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI).  
 10 Years of Fun & Play    

 14-17 October 2024  
   
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

 14 - 18 July 2025, Computability in Europe 2025 (CiE 2025), Lisbon, Portugal  
 Date: 14 - 18 July 2025   
 Location: Lisbon, Portugal   
 Deadline: Sunday 26 January 2025   
 CiE (Computability in Europe) is a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world.  
 The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics. Computability in Europe 2025 "Crossroads of Computability and Logic: Insights, Inspirations, and Innovations" will feature two Tutorial Speakers, 6 Invited Speakers, 6 Special Sessions and the Women in Computability program.  
   
 The Program Committee cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2025. Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag.  
 Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we also invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2025 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.

  Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization   
 June 20 - 22, 2023, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany   

 Welcome  
   The Cologne-Twente Workshop on Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization 2023 welcomes contributions on theory and applications of discrete algorithms, graphs and combinatorial optimization in the wider sense.  
 The series of Cologne-Twente Workshops on Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization started with meetings organized every two years by the universities of Cologne and Twente. The organizational base was later expanded by other universities. Since 2003 the workshop is held (almost) every year.  
 CTWs are especially intended to let doctoral students and young researchers present the results of their research activities in a friendly and highly interactive atmosphere.
