 The Twelfth AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing  
  October 16–19, 2024  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  @hcomp_conf  – #HCOMP2024   

 Welcome to HCOMP 2024!  
 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) will be held October 16-19th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will particularly focus on the theme of '' Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI  .''  
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.  
 HCOMP 2024 is colocated with ACM UIST 2024  (October 13-16, 2024).  
     
 HCOMP 2024 builds on a successful history of past meetings  : eleven HCOMP conferences (2013–2023) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).

5. Conference ANT_0:
The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies  
  April 22-24, 2025, Patras, Greece   

  to ANT 2025  
 The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2025) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  
 ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years.  
 Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level).  
 All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. You will be able to provide a hyperlink to all delegates and direct your conference website visitors to your proceedings.

 SIGCOMM Conference   

 SIGCOMM Conference    
  
 SIGCOMM is our flagship annual conference. This page links to previous SIGCOMM conferences.   
 Mission   
 SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM), a vital special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).   
 The annual SIGCOMM conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of computer and data communication networks. We invite submissions on network architecture, design, implementation, operations, analysis, measurement, and simulation.   
 Full papers are no more than 14 pages long and typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. Posters present ongoing work on one 30" x 40" (75cm x 100cm) page. Student poster submissions will be favored.   
 Papers are double-blind reviewed (no author identification) by a technical program committee (TPC). Depending on the year and the program chairs, the TPC can have between 20-40 researchers. The paper acceptance ratio also varies year to year, from between 8-16%, on average accepting 30-35 papers out of 300-350 submissions.   
 The meeting is 3 days, single-track. It is accompanied by 2 days of tutorials and related workshops which vary each year. The conference occurs once a year in the late summer, with the location varying internationally, typically including locations in North America and Europe every three years.   
 Attendance is open, and there are some limited student travel grants available.

The award recognizes the most impactful HCOMP paper published a decade ago (withstanding the test of 10 years worth of time). For the instantiation of this award, papers published at the conference until the year 2014 were considered.  
 The award will be received by Aashish Sheshadri and Matthew Lease for their AAAI HCOMP 2013 paper titled, '' Square: A benchmark for research on computing crowd consensus  .'' The paper presented an open source shared task framework including benchmark datasets, defined tasks, standard metrics, and reference implementations with empirical results for popular methods at the time of publishing. This paper was instrumental in shaping work related to crowd consensus and efforts to improve response aggregation in crowdsourcing. It has been the most cited HCOMP paper during this period, and been widely used as a resource in crowdsourcing courses at different universities.

19. Conference ANT_3:
The 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies  
  April 23-25, 2024, Hasselt, Belgium   

  to ANT 2024  
 The 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 7th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  
 ANT 2024 will be held in the city of Hasselt. Hasselt was founded in approximately the 7th century on the Helbeek, a small tributary of the Demer  river. The name Hasselt came from Hasaluth  , which means hazel wood. During the Middle Ages, it became one of the bigger towns of the county of Loon  , which had borders approximately the same as the current province of Limburg. Hasselt is an old yet modern city which is home to multiple academic institutions and where visitors can enjoy a variety of activities and entertainment.  
 ANT 2024 is co-organized & co-hosted by the Hasselt University, Belgium  . Since 1973 Hasselt University is located on the Campus Diepenbeek, which occupies an attractive 150 acre site in the middle of Limburg's green belt. It is 2 kms west of the town centre of Diepenbeek, a residential town of 17.717 inhabitants, and 4 kms east of Hasselt which has a population of about 69.529 and is the administrative and commercial centre of the province. Brussels is 90 kms away (to the South-West), Antwerp lies 90 kms to the West, Liege (in the French-speaking part of Belgium) 45 kms to the South, Maastricht (in the Netherlands) 25 kms to the East, Aachen (in Germany) 60 kms to the South-East.  
   
 All ANT 2024 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (http://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. You will be able to provide a hyperlink to all delegates and direct your conference website visitors to your proceedings.  
 (optional) Social Event @ ANT 2024  
     
 Visit to the C-mine expedition :  (located in the nearby city of Genk)  
 C-mine expedition starts in the energy building of the C-mine site. First you descend to 6 meter deep where you get to see a lot of surprising installations. Famous artists such as Stijn Meuris and Pascale Platel made unique stories about the mine in combination with creative image projections. In the interactive sound cell you are going to get busy. Produce your own 'sound ' by levers, buttons and wheels to operate. Or sample the atmosphere while you're wondering around in the maze on the way to the topsoil.The highlight of the expedition is to climb the giant and authentic mine tower on the square. That is more than 60 meters high! Perhaps you reach the top exhausted, but the reward is greater: gorgeous views of the green surroundings of Limburg. For the slightly less ' big ' daredevil, there is a stop at 15 metres height. If you don't like heights, stay comfortable with both feet firmly on the ground. Just enjoy the open feeling on the beautifully renovated square.

  Call for Papers    

 The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  
  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

  Submission Instructions  
 Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  
  
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   Paper Formatting   
 Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here  ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  
 Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. 
  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. 
  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. 
  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Submissions   
  
 ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions   
 Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  
 Ethical Considerations   
 The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  
 Early Rejection and Appeals   
 There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Paper Revision and Resubmission   
 Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   
 If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

 Call for papers   
 The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners, CSCW 2025 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, including social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.  
 Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems; or introduce new approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies — including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR — relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues  . Submissions by members of underrepresented groups are particularly welcome. Authors exploring historical and sociotechnical perspectives on CSCW systems are also encouraged to submit.  
 We invite contributions to CSCW across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:  
 Social and crowd computing. | Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, or collaborative information behaviors. 
  CSCW and social computing system development. | Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that are explored and discussed within the context of building new social and collaborative systems and experiences. 
  Methodologies and tools. | Novel human-centered methods, or combinations of approaches and tools used in building collaborative systems or studying their use. 
  Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses. | Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices within and beyond work settings illuminating their historical, social, and material specificity, and/or exploring their political or ethical dimensions. 
  Empirical investigations. | Findings, guidelines, and/or studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use, as related to CSCW and social technologies. 
  Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications. | Including applications to healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains. 
  Ethics and policy implications. | Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems in social, cooperative and collaborative practices, as well as the algorithms that shape them. 
  CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies. | Including mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, and sensing systems. 
  Crossing boundaries. | Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures to help better understand how CSCW and social systems might help transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries. 
  Send queries about paper submissions to papers2025@cscw.acm.org  .  
 To promote work-life balance, we have set all deadlines on Tuesdays to avoid weekends at any time zone.  
 SUBMISSION PROCESS   
 SUBMISSION MODEL   
 To support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with the opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction  (PACM HCI) Journal.  
 CSCW 2025 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. Thus, new paper submissions will be only possible for the July 2024  and October 2024  deadlines. We have four additional deadlines in December, March, April, and July for revisions only. Failure to submit a revised version of a paper by the associated deadline means that the paper has been withdrawn.  
 Below is an overview of the submission timeline. All a  ccepted papers from these two cycles will be invited to present at CSCW 2025.   
   JULY 2024 CYCLE   
 July 2, 2024: | New paper submissions due 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time. | Expected notification date: | Oct 9, 2024 AoE. 
  Possible outcomes: | Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject. 
  October 29, 2024: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Nov 19, 2024. 
  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. 
  December 10, 2024: | Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Feb 12, 2025. 
  Possible outcomes: | Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject. 
  March 4, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Mar 26, 2025.

  2025 Submissions   
 The next paper submission deadline is expected to be in May 2025. This will be announced by the 2026 Chairs once the submission deadline is finalized.  
 PROCESS DETAILS   
 CSCW 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com  . Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy, including, but not limited to:  
 That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. 
  Occasionally, a paper may have some overlap with a prior publication (for example, there is some overlap with the datasets used, but the analyses in each paper are considered to be a completely different and substantial contribution). This | must | be disclosed to the editorial team at the time of submission. Authors must provide a detailed explanation of the overlap and distinct contribution of each paper in the “Comments (optional)” field on the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in reuse of content from prior publications available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions 
  Similarly, for parallel submissions (authors submitting multiple papers related to the same study), authors also need to provide information about the relationship between submissions, as well as how they are different from one another in the “Comments (optional)” field of the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in simultaneous submissions available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions 
  That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. 
  For information about re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to section 1.5.4 of the ACM SIGCHI policy.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the PACM HCI and the ACM Digital Library.  
 Authors should adhere to the new ACM policy in authorship, available at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship  .  
 PAPER GUIDELINES REGARDING SCOPE   
 CSCW is a broad and interdisciplinary field, covering many methods, theories, and epistemologies. It is difficult to draw explicit disciplinary boundaries of what counts and what does not count as CSCW research. Nonetheless, in the spirit of welcoming those new and not as familiar to CSCW, we believe it is beneficial to offer some guidelines when deciding whether your submissions are appropriate for CSCW.  
 In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation  and be  properly contextualized   in the CSCW literature  , with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected or being proposed. Please note that papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope. For example, this would include papers whose major contribution is on user research findings that inform the design of a system primarily focused on benefiting a sole, individual user. Also, systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.  
 Therefore, authors should clearly answer yes to the following:  
 Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community? 
  Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions? 
  Authors must make sure that their submission is within the scope of the conference. During the submission, authors will be asked to write a short paragraph explaining how this is the case. Contributions out of scope will be desk rejected.   The scope statement should be fully anonymized to ensure the double-blind review process – see section on anonymous review policy below. Please ensure your statement does not contain any information that can identify any of the authors, their institutions, partners, or cities.  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names  and affiliations  removed, including references to universities, institutional review boards,   companies, labs, and cities  . Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Furthermore, obvious identifying statements and information that might confuse reviewers regarding the authors (e.g., mock authors’ names originally in templates provided to demonstrate formatting) should be removed. Images used in the paper must NOT disclose the authors identity or suggest affiliation. This policy includes all submitted materials, including supplemental materials and the scope statement. Papers that violate this policy will be desk rejected.    
 Please check in particular the first page, headers and footers, images, the acknowledgements section, AND meta-data of all   submitted file   s   .  For resubmissions, make sure that the authors’ identities are not disclosed in the annotated document submitted in addition to the clean version. If possible, check the document with tracked changes in different PDF readers. It is possible that some tracked-change information that is visible in a reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) is not visible in others (e.g., Preview).  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should NOT be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work…”  
 CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until the review process is complete  . Please do not share any confidential information specific to a current review process publicly or on social media, with the exception of doing public exhibitions, festivals, and performances as part of the research where the name is integral to the work.  
 When submitting your papers to PCS, please also ensure your scope statement follows the anonymous review policy.  
 We also ask reviewers to refrain from taking steps to learn about authors’ identity during the peer review process.  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 Word authors:  Because CSCW papers are published in PACM HCI, which uses the Sheridan service, authors need to use the old interim ACM Small template,  which is ONLY available at the following link:  
  https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates   
 LaTeX authors  need to use the template at  
  https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions  , and insert the acmsmall call.  
 Overleaf authors  need to use the template at  
  https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf  , and use the acmsmall call.  
 Papers that use a completely different template will be  desk rejected.    Small variance on font styles, which is possible when authors do not have particular fonts installed in their computers, will be tolerated for the initial submission but will have to be fixed in case the paper is accepted for publication.  
 Note:  In preparing revisions, authors should continue using the template they had used for their original submissions. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be  rejected   .  Note that additional materials can be submitted as appendices but be aware that reviewers are not bound to decide based on these materials.  
 POLICY ON USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) AND OTHER AI TOOLS   
 If AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the writing of the paper beyond a simple grammar check, their use should be acknowledged and described in the text of the submitted version. ACM policy  states that authors must be the “creator or originator of an idea” and/or work, so relying on AI-tools to generate ideas in the manuscript is not allowed. Note that we will investigate submissions brought to our attention for undeclared use of LLMs or other AI-tools.  
 DECISIONS AND DEADLINES   
 CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the cycle). For the July 2024 submission deadline, we hope to send out all final notifications by Mar 26, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that receive a Major Revisions notification after initial submission. For the October 2024 submission deadline, all final notifications should be out by Aug 6, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that initially received a Major Revisions recommendation for that cycle.  
 Accept: | Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted for verification by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC). The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of the PACM HCI. 
  Minor revision: | Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication. The revised submission MUST be submitted along with a brief response to the reviewers’ comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC) and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper. 
  Major revision: | Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, then re-reviewed. For July 2024 submissions receiving a Major Revision decision must be resubmitted by the December 2024 deadline. For October 2024 submissions, major revisions are due in April 2025. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same AC and reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Accept with minor revisions or Reject. Unlike most journals, the current CSCW review process does NOT allow for more than one major revision recommendation due to reviewer availability and time constraints. 
  Reject: | Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers under special conditions. Please refer to the section | Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers. 
  Desk / Quick Reject: | Authors should only submit completed work of | publishable quality | and | within the scope of ACM CSCW | . Editors will | desk reject | papers that do not comply with such requirements. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will also be | desk rejected | without review. Finally, the ACs, in cooperation with the Editors, may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. While we endeavor to notify authors early in the process, desk or quick rejects may happen at | any time | throughout the review process up until notifications. 
  RESUBMISSION OF REJECTED AND WITHDRAWN PAPERS   
 Papers in the following categories can be resubmitted at the next submission deadline:  
 Papers that have been desk or quick rejected 
  Papers that got Minor Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) 
  Papers that gets rejected after resubmitting Major Revisions 
  On the other hand, papers that fall in one of the following categories must wait an extra deadline to be resubmitted:  
 Papers that get rejected in first review round 
  Papers that got Major Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) 
  For example, if the paper was rejected after the initial submission in July 2024, authors cannot re-submit in the October 2024 cycle, but can resubmit the paper after    the October 2024 cycle.  
 Please notice that all resubmitted papers will be treated as a new submission, meaning they will most likely be assigned to a new Editor, new ACs, and new reviewers. Papers resubmitted with no or marginal changes (except resubmission of minor revisions papers that missed the resubmission deadline) will be desk rejected  without review.  
 Authors must describe the paper’s submission history and briefly outline the changes in a designated field in PCS when resubmitting. Failure to disclose the paper’s submission history may lead to a desk reject  decision. ACs and reviewers will have access to this description of the paper’s submission history and may also request to review the detailed submission history.  
 DECISION APPEAL PROCESS   
 We recognize that authors may sometimes feel a review is unfair, inappropriate, or problematic in other ways. CSCW has implemented the following process for authors who wish to appeal a decision:  
 Either: | Authors directly contact the Papers Chairs to officially appeal a decision 
  A committee member (1AC / 2AC / Editor / Papers Chair) raises an issue about the decision or decision-making process, possibly in response to a communication from an author 
  The appeal involves motivating the case with evidence 
  Papers Chairs assess the situation and make an initial call to bring it up for discussion with the Editors 
  The Editor assigned to the submission reviews the paper, the reviews, and the discussion in PCS to determine if the case is valid. The Editor may choose to involve the ACs at this stage 
  Other Editors weigh in and review the case 
  The Editors come to a collective decision and share their decision with the Papers Chairs 
  The Papers Chairs discuss the Editors’ decision. If a change is agreed, Papers Chairs record the updated decision in PCS 
  The Papers Chairs communicate the final decision to the authors. Decisions are final and further appeals will not be pursued. 
  Appeals must be submitted no later than seven days after the decision notification is out. Any appeal submitted after that time limit will not be pursued.   
 PRIMARY RESEARCH PARADIGM   
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment. Currently there are six paradigm choices available:  
 Technical/Systems, e.g., building novel CSCW systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc. 
  Empirical–Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc. 
  Empirical–Quantitative, e.g., “big data,” quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc. 
  Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development, etc. 
  Design, e.g., design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis, literature reviews, and essays, etc. 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE   
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to describe efforts to make their work more reproducible. Reviewers are encouraged to support evolving approaches to supporting open and transparent research practices.  
 VIDEO FIGURES   
 Authors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long). Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.  
 PRESENTING AT THE CONFERENCE   
 Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present. If a situation arises and an author who is scheduled to present at the conference is no longer able to, they should immediately reach out to the Papers Chairs to discuss alternative options. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required.

 ACM SenSys 2025  
  6 - 9 May  Irvine, USA   
 The 23rd ACM Conference on  
  Embedded Networked Sensor Systems   
 In transition to Conference on  
  Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems    

 Announcement from the Joint  
  SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee  
 We are excited to announce the merger of three leading conferences — ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and ACM/IEEE IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new name SenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems  . This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   
 ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10. The submission server will open mid-January.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors will be required to format their submissions using the EC’25 LaTex style files   , which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to select which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be evaluated. Authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’25 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. | Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang,  Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck | . 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. | Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren | . 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. | Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov | . 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. | Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah | . 
  Areas.  Each submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.  
 Agent-based modeling 
  Algorithmic fairness and data privacy 
  Auctions and pricing 
  Behavioral economics and bounded rationality 
  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies 
  Contract design 
  Crowdsourcing and information elicitation 
  Decision theory 
  Econometrics 
  Economic aspects of learning algorithms 
  Economic aspects of neural networks and large language models 
  Equilibrium analysis, including price of anarchy 
  Equilibrium computation and complexity 
  Fair division 
  Industrial organization 
  Information design 
  Laboratory and field experiments 
  Market design & matching markets 
  Market equilibria 
  Mechanism design 
  Online algorithms 
  Online platforms and applications 
  Social good and ethics 
  Social choice & voting theory 
  Social networks and social learning 
  Alternative venues.  In addition, we will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper. We understand that different communities have different ways of highlighting the contribution and will use this information to match papers to reviewers familiar with the appropriate context.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
  There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
  The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  (e.g., papers on arXiv). It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’25 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’25 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’25 submission deadline, (c) papers in which one or more of the contributions have previously been published or accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’25 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  As in prior years, authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. The decision to select or decline this option will take place when authors are submitting the camera-ready version of the paper (or one-page abstract) for the conference proceedings and additional instructions for authors will be provided at that time. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  American Economic Journal: Microeconomics 
  Algorithmica 
  Econometrica | Notes: | A submission would require the standard submission fee. Authors should clearly state in the cover letter that the paper is a forward to journal from EC 25. This would allow editors to get access to the reviews. In addition, | authors should submit the paper together with a short revision plan, instead of the detailed response letter that is submitted to reviewers in a revision. The Editor in charge could then use any subset of the EC reviewers he/she would find useful. The short “revision plan” is intended to prevent authors from spending significant time responding to comments and then having the paper dismissed if the Editor in charge doesn’t think there’s a path forward. 
  Games and Economic Behavior 
  International Economic Review 
  International Journal of Game Theory 
  Journal of Political Economy 
  Management Science | , Market Design, Platform, and Demand Analytics area 
  Marketing Science 
  Mathematics of Operations Research | , Game Theory area | Notes: The journal is open to considering forward-to-journals to other areas, if the authors believe a different area is a better fit. Please contact the Editor. 
  Operations Research | , Markets, Platforms, and Revenue Management area | Notes: Please read carefully the conference to journal submission policy. | https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/opre/conference-to-journal-submission-policy | When utilizing the forward-to-journal from EC to Operations Research, adding a response document discussing the reviewer comments and whether/how they have been addressed is recommended. 
  Quantitative Marketing and Economics 
  RAND Journal of Economics 
  Review of Economic Studies 
  Social Choice and Welfare 
  TheoretiCS 
  Theoretical Economics 
  We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
  
 Feature at INFORMS.  Authors of accepted papers can indicate if they wish to be considered for presenting their papers in special sessions at the 2025 INFORMS Annual Meeting, organized and sponsored by the INFORMS Auctions and Market Design (AMD) Section. To be considered for this fast-track selection process conducted by the AMD cluster chairs, authors will need to provide a short non-technical abstract (at most 500 characters) and indicate whether the intended presenter is an INFORMS job market candidate. The exact deadline to submit this information will be announced soon.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Program Committee members. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

Short papers will be evaluated based on the originality of their ideas, potential impact, and clarity of presentation, even without extensive evaluations. Similar to full papers, accepted short papers will be presented orally at the conference.   
   
 Submission Guidelines:  
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages  with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here  . LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.  
   
  Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.

  CODE OF CONDUCT 

 CODE OF CONDUCT  
 Welcome to CSCW 2025! We believe in respect, compassion, understanding and inclusion. We expect all community members to act in accordance with these values. Fostering the free exchange of ideas requires building a conference that welcomes people of all backgrounds. Diversity of opinion and background is a fundamental strength of our community. The members of our community must have the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. Toward that goal, ACM CSCW conferences aim to create spaces where every participant can express themselves without fear of judgement or harassment.  
 The ACM CSCW Codes of Conduct guides the expected, professional behavior of conference participants, including:  
 Treating everyone with respect and consideration; under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and online. 
  Communicating openly and thoughtfully with others and being considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that may be different than your own. 
  Being respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas. 
  Being mindful of your fellow participants. 
  Respecting participants wishes to not be photographed, respecting their gender pronouns, respecting their space, and their right to engage or disengage in conversation. 
  We believe disagreement and differences of opinion are a natural part of social and academic life and are important to work through when building community and learning from one another. At the same time, we acknowledge that societal power structures are even more challenging in academia, which is an inherently hierarchical community. In order to foster an environment of inclusion, we do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or abuse in any form. Participants who engage in harassment may be removed from the conference at the discretion of the organizers.  
 Harassment includes, but is not limited to:  
 Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices 
  Deliberate intimidation or antagonism 
  Exclusionary jokes or comments 
  Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact 
  Sustained disruption of presentations, events, or online discussion 
  Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease 
  Comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion) 
  Threats of violence.

  Introduction   
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  
 What’s New   
 There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  
 Reserve Reviewer Policy 
  Data-Availability Statement 
  Contact   
 You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  
 oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  
 In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  
 At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  
 Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  
 Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  
 Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  
 If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  
 If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. 
  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. 
  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. 
  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. 
  Reserve Reviewer Policy   
 To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  
 Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  
  
 The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  
 Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  
 We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  
 The paper has no senior authors. 
  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. 
  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); 
  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; 
  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. 
  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  
 Submissions   
 Template   
 SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 Page Limit   
 Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  
 Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  
 Anonymity   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymize supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Novelty   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  
 In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  
 It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  
 Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  
 Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  
 Procedure   
 Please submit using HotCRP  .  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  
 The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  You can find the updated policy here  .  
 FAQ   
 What are reviewers looking for?   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  
 How are papers from previous years handled?   
 We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  
 Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  
 Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  
 What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  
 Should I change the name of my system?   
 No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  
 My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  
 Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   
 We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  
 Things you may  do:  
 Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not  do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

 ACM SenSys 2025  
  6 - 9 May  Irvine, USA   
 The 23rd ACM Conference on  
  Embedded Networked Sensor Systems   
 In transition to Conference on  
  Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems    

 Announcement from the Joint  
  SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee  
 We are excited to announce the merger of three leading conferences — ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and ACM/IEEE IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new name SenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems  . This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   
 ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

  Submission Guidelines  
 All papers for ACM WiSec 2025 must be submitted electronically through the HotCRP conference management system  .  
 Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  
 The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . 
  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
  Full, short, and SoK papers  
 Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2025 can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind reviewing.  
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Posters and demos  
 WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Artifact Evaluation label  
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Double submissions  
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  
 Workshops and Tutorial  
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  
 Research Ethics  
 Ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices were not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advances tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  
 All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment  ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)  . Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc)  . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations)  . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 Bryan Goda    
 United States Military Academy, Deputy Head, Dept of EE&CS   

 SIGITE has allowed me to meet educators in the IT community. Because of SIGITE, I was able to start an IT program from scratch and get it accredited in a 4 year span because of wealth of knowledge of its members and their willingness to help. It is also a great venue for my IT faculty to publish and present their accomplishments.    

 Dr. Amber Settle    
 Associate Professor, DePaul University   

 This past weekend I attended and presented at the SIGITE Conference located in Midland, Michigan. It was the second weekend in a row that I was going to be gone, and all of that in the middle of the quarter, so I wasn’t as enthusiastic going into it as I normally am about conferences. As it turns out it was the best conference experience I’ve had in a long time!   
 The sessions at the conference are scheduled so that each talk has a 45-minute slot, with 30 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions. In most of the sessions I attended, including my own, the questions were in fact intermixed with the presentation. And what a difference it makes to have more time and a more interactive environment. I got excellent feedback on my work and was able to provide a lot more background information than was on my slides because of the questions. The questions themselves were also terrific. I was impressed by the insight that the audience members had into the work. I also got good questions and offers for collaborations after the talk, but it was the interactive presentations that really had me hooked.   
 On top of that, I met friendly, intelligent, and insightful people during the breaks, meals, and the reception. I had some of the best conference conversations ever, and I’m hoping that I’ll get a chance to stay in touch with the people I met.  So overall, I highly recommend SIGITE as a conference. Next year it will be at West Point in New York, and they’ve promised private tours of things that even tourists don’t get to see. That combined with the lively and friendly experience make it don’t miss opportunity.    

 Dr. Yan Bai    
 Assistant Professor Institute of Technology University of Washington Tacoma   

 I attended SIGITE’10 held in midland, MI. I really enjoy every session I attended! The conference presenters at SIGITE’10 provide valuable information about the IT program, curricula, courses, and accreditation. Everything about IT education! In particular, I appreciate the opportunity to network IT educators from around the US, and learn many new ideas for laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of IT instruction in the areas of cyber security and information networking. I’m certainly looking forward to SIGITE’11.   

 Ryan Kazmerik    
 Undergraduate Student Mount Royal University, Calgary   

 I am really glad that my paper was accepted and I was able to present at SIGITE 2010 as it gave me a peak into the process of IT education. Often students sometimes think that courses topics and curriculum are picked out of a hat, but the topic I chose exposed me to the same tough problems that the IT community has been dealing with for years.   

 Lani Fraizer    
 Synergies in Sync | iWE Project Pepperdine University   

 SIGITE’s growing community of ACM faculty, alumni and students provided me with a strong resource of experts and enthusiasts who champion IT education. What I loved most about SIGITE is that the community and its officers are welcoming and keen on both national, as well as global issues regarding IT education.   

 Dr. Glenn Wilson    
 Associate Research Professor of Technology Director, Information and Innovation University of Maine   

 Having been a long-time member of ACM, I was curious about SIGITE, so I attended the conference in Midland, Michigan this fall. It was a wonderful experience in three aspects. First, and foremost, the quality of presentations and the professional camaraderie among presenters and members was excellent. Secondly, the keynote speaker, CIO of Dow Chemical, was exceptionally informative, particularly as regards the way Dow recruits and situates its IT new-hires. And finally, I felt quite welcome and quickly accepted as new member of SIGITE, and look forward to becoming more involved in this dynamic and high-quality SIG.

 SIGITE has allowed me to meet educators in the IT community. Because of SIGITE, I was able to start an IT program from scratch and get it accredited in a 4 year span because of wealth of knowledge of its members and their willingness to help. It is also a great venue for my IT faculty to publish and present their accomplishments.    

 Dr. Amber Settle    
 Associate Professor, DePaul University   

 This past weekend I attended and presented at the SIGITE Conference located in Midland, Michigan. It was the second weekend in a row that I was going to be gone, and all of that in the middle of the quarter, so I wasn’t as enthusiastic going into it as I normally am about conferences. As it turns out it was the best conference experience I’ve had in a long time!   
 The sessions at the conference are scheduled so that each talk has a 45-minute slot, with 30 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions. In most of the sessions I attended, including my own, the questions were in fact intermixed with the presentation. And what a difference it makes to have more time and a more interactive environment. I got excellent feedback on my work and was able to provide a lot more background information than was on my slides because of the questions. The questions themselves were also terrific. I was impressed by the insight that the audience members had into the work. I also got good questions and offers for collaborations after the talk, but it was the interactive presentations that really had me hooked.   
 On top of that, I met friendly, intelligent, and insightful people during the breaks, meals, and the reception. I had some of the best conference conversations ever, and I’m hoping that I’ll get a chance to stay in touch with the people I met.  So overall, I highly recommend SIGITE as a conference. Next year it will be at West Point in New York, and they’ve promised private tours of things that even tourists don’t get to see. That combined with the lively and friendly experience make it don’t miss opportunity.    

 Dr. Yan Bai    
 Assistant Professor Institute of Technology University of Washington Tacoma   

 I attended SIGITE’10 held in midland, MI. I really enjoy every session I attended! The conference presenters at SIGITE’10 provide valuable information about the IT program, curricula, courses, and accreditation. Everything about IT education! In particular, I appreciate the opportunity to network IT educators from around the US, and learn many new ideas for laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of IT instruction in the areas of cyber security and information networking. I’m certainly looking forward to SIGITE’11.   

 Ryan Kazmerik    
 Undergraduate Student Mount Royal University, Calgary   

 I am really glad that my paper was accepted and I was able to present at SIGITE 2010 as it gave me a peak into the process of IT education. Often students sometimes think that courses topics and curriculum are picked out of a hat, but the topic I chose exposed me to the same tough problems that the IT community has been dealing with for years.

 SIGITE’s growing community of ACM faculty, alumni and students provided me with a strong resource of experts and enthusiasts who champion IT education. What I loved most about SIGITE is that the community and its officers are welcoming and keen on both national, as well as global issues regarding IT education.   

 Dr. Glenn Wilson    
 Associate Research Professor of Technology Director, Information and Innovation University of Maine   

 Having been a long-time member of ACM, I was curious about SIGITE, so I attended the conference in Midland, Michigan this fall. It was a wonderful experience in three aspects. First, and foremost, the quality of presentations and the professional camaraderie among presenters and members was excellent. Secondly, the keynote speaker, CIO of Dow Chemical, was exceptionally informative, particularly as regards the way Dow recruits and situates its IT new-hires. And finally, I felt quite welcome and quickly accepted as new member of SIGITE, and look forward to becoming more involved in this dynamic and high-quality SIG.
