 Areas of Interest  
 We welcome the submission of technical papers describing significant and original research on all aspects of the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. If you are new to this community, then we encourage you to consult the proceedings of previous editions of the conference to fully appreciate the scope of AAMAS. At the time of submission, you will be asked to associate your paper with one of the following areas of interest:  
 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN) 
  Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP) 
  Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE) 
  Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS) 
  Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR) 
  Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS) 
  Modeling and Simulation of Societies (SIM) 
  Human-Agent Interaction (HAI) 
  Robotics and Control (ROBOT) 
  Innovative Applications (IA) 
   
 Additionally, AAMAS 2025 includes several special tracks  . You can find more information about these tracks here  .  
 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)  
 Area Chairs  : Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster  
 Topics  :  
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised and representation learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Multiagent learning 
  Evolutionary algorithms 
  Learning agent capabilities 
  Learning agent-to-agent interactions 
  Human-in-the-loop learning 
  Agency and learning in large language models (LLMs) 
  Learning for value alignment and RLHF 
  Modeling and analysis of Generative AI agents 
  Few-shot learning 
  Distributionally-robust learning 
  Adversarial learning 
  Description  : Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication.  
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)  
 Area Chairs  : Reshef Meir, Nisarg Shah, Georgios Piliouras, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Rica Gonen  
 Topics  :  
 Auctions and Mechanism Design 
  Bargaining and Negotiation 
  Behavioral Game Theory 
  Evolutionary Game Theory 
  Non-Cooperative Games: Equilibrium Concepts 
  Non-Cooperative Games: Computational Issues 
  Non-Cooperative Games: Theory and Applications 
  Voting and Preference Aggregation 
  Social Choice 
  Preference Aggregation and Value Alignment 
  Matching and Allocation 
  Coalition Formation 
  Cooperative Games 
  Description  : This area encompasses research on cooperative and non-cooperative games, social choice, and mechanism design, specifically focusing on computational aspects such as algorithmic and complexity analysis for equilibrium computation and verification. The area also welcomes theoretical explorations and analysis related to game theory, mechanism and market design, and social choice. Submissions showcasing practical applications of game theory are also strongly encouraged.  
 Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE)  
 Area Chairs  : Felipe Meneguzzi, Pradeep Murukannaiah  
 Topics:   
 Coordination and teamwork 
  Social network analysis 
  Norms, normative systems 
  Organizations and institutions 
  Non-strategic coalition/team formation 
  Communication, including using natural language 
  Policy, regulation, and accountability 
  Trust and reputation 
  Ethical considerations, including privacy, safety, security, transparency 
  Agreement Technologies: Negotiation and Argumentations 
  Responsible socio-technical systems 
  Description  : Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned. We encourage the submission of papers that highlight the design, development, evaluation, simulation, and analysis of novel, innovative, and impactful research on issues related to the above topics.  
 Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS)  
 Area Chairs  : William Yeoh, Sven Koenig  
 Topics  :  
 Single-agent planning and scheduling 
  Multiagent planning and scheduling 
  Decentralized planning and scheduling 
  Planning under uncertainty 
  Combinatorial optimization 
  Constraint programming 
  Distributed constraint reasoning 
  Resource and task allocation 
  Non-strategic coalition formation 
  Description  : This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to search, optimization, planning, and scheduling in single- and multi-agent systems. Important subfields include decentralized planning, planning under uncertainty, combinatorial optimization, distributed constraint reasoning, resource and task allocation, and non-strategic coalition formation. Machine learning approaches as well as foundation models for planning and scheduling are encouraged. Likewise, all approaches to single- and multi-agent planning, including motion and path planning, and their interplay with other agent components are relevant.  
 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)  
 Area Chairs  : Natasha Alechina, Aparna Taneja, Alessio Lomuscio  
 Topics  :  
 Computer vision 
  Representation learning and generative AI 
  Neurosymbolic approaches 
  Argumentation 
  Agent theories and models 
  Explainability 
  Logics for agent reasoning 
  Ontologies for agents 
  Reasoning about knowledge, beliefs, goals, actions, plans, and change in multiagent systems 
  Reasoning and problem solving in agent-based systems 
  Verification of agents and multiagent systems 
  Description  : This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning in single-agent and multi-agent systems. Knowledge representation is to be understood broadly, ranging from theoretical contributions (e.g., epistemic, strategic, description, and other logics) to representation learning. Moreover, representation and reasoning in complex settings often entails reasoning about sensing and perception. Relevant forms of reasoning include, for instance, automated reasoning and theorem proving approaches, verification-based approaches, as well as probabilistic reasoning and neurosymbolic approaches, as long as they are applied to, or motivated by reasoning about agents and/or multiagent systems.

  Description  : Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs.

  Description  :  
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction.

 Modeling Distributed Algorithms by Abstract State Machines Compared to Petri Nets    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.3-34 

 We show how to model distributed algorithms by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Comparing these models with Petri nets (PNs) reveals a certain number of idiosyncrasies of PNs which complicate both model design and analysis. The ASMs we define illustrate how one can avoid such framework related technicalities.   

 A Universal Control Construct for Abstract State Machines    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.37-53 

 Abstract State Machines can be used to specify arbitrary system behaviour. However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g., in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed. We illustrate how the control construct can improve the code’s readability on some examples. The proposed control construct is also released as a plugin for CoreASM.   

 Encoding TLA $$^{+}$$ + into Many-Sorted First-Order Logic    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.54-69 

 This paper presents an encoding of a non-temporal fragment of the \({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}\) language, which includes untyped set theory, functions, arithmetic expressions, and Hilbert’s \(\varepsilon \) operator, into many-sorted first-order logic, the input language of state-of-the-art smt solvers. This translation, based on encoding techniques such as boolification, injection of unsorted expressions into sorted languages, term rewriting, and abstraction, is the core component of a back-end prover based on smt solvers for the \({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}\) Proof System.   

 Proving Determinacy of the PharOS Real-Time Operating System    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.70-85 

 Executions in the PharOS real-time system are deterministic in the sense that the sequence of local states for every process is independent of the order in which processes are scheduled. The essential ingredient for achieving this property is that a temporal window of execution is associated with every instruction. Messages become visible to receiving processes only after the time window of the sending message has elapsed. We present a high-level model of PharOS in TLA+ and formally state and prove determinacy using the TLA+ Proof System.   

 A Rigorous Correctness Proof for Pastry    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.86-101 

 Peer-to-peer protocols for maintaining distributed hash tables, such as Pastry or Chord, have become popular for a class of Internet applications. While such protocols promise certain properties concerning correctness and performance, verification attempts using formal methods invariably discover border cases that violate some of those guarantees. Tianxiang Lu reported correctness problems in published versions of Pastry and also developed a model, which he called LuPastry, for which he provided a partial proof of correct delivery assuming no node departures, mechanized in the TLA\(^+\) Proof System. Lu’s proof is based on certain assumptions that were left unproven. We found counter-examples to several of these assumptions. In this paper, we present a revised model and rigorous proof of correct delivery, which we call LuPastry\(^+\). Aside from being the first complete proof, LuPastry\(^+\) also improves upon Lu’s work by reformulating parts of the specification in such a way that the reasoning complexity is confined to a small part of the proof.   

 Enabling Analysis for Event-B    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.102-118 

 In this paper we present a static analysis to determine how events influence each other in Event-B models. The analysis, called an enabling analysis, uses syntactic and constraint-based techniques to compute the effect of executing one event on the guards of another event. We describe the foundations of the approach along with the realisation in ProB. The output of the analysis can help a user to understand the control flow of a formal model. Additionally, we discuss how the information of the enabling analysis can be used to obtain a new optimised model checking algorithm. We evaluate both the performance of the enabling analysis and the new model checking technique on a variety of models. The technique is also applicable to B, TLA + , and Z models.   

 A Compact Encoding of Sequential ASMs in Event-B    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.119-134 

 We present a translation of sequential ASMs to Event-B specifications. The translation also addresses the partial update problem, and allows a variable to be updated (consistently) in parallel. On the theoretical side, the translation highlights the intricacies of ASM rule execution in terms of Event-B semantics. On the practical side, we show on a series of examples that the Event-B encoding remains compact and is amenable to proof within Rodin as well as animation and model checking using ProB.   

 Proof Assisted Symbolic Model Checking for B and Event-B    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.135-150 

 We have implemented various symbolic model checking algorithms, like BMC, k-Induction and IC3 for B and Event-B. The high-level nature of B and Event-B accounts for complicated constraints arising in these symbolic analysis techniques. In this paper we suggest using static information stemming from proof obligations to simplify occurring constraints. We show how to include proof information in the aforementioned algorithms. Using different benchmarks we compare explicit state to symbolic model checking as well as techniques with and without proof assistance. In particular for models with large branching factor, e.g., due to complicated data values being manipulated, the symbolic techniques fare much better than explicit state model checking. The inclusion of proof information results in further clear performance improvements.   

 On Component-Based Reuse for Event-B    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.151-166 

 Efficient reuse is a goal of many software engineering strategies and is useful in the safety-critical domain where formal development is required. Event-B can be used to develop safety-critical systems, but could be improved by a component-based reuse strategy. In this paper, we outline a component-based reuse methodology for Event-B. It provides a means for bottom-up scalability, and can also be used with the existing top-down approach. We describe the process of creating library components , their composition, and specification of new properties (involving the composed elements). We introduce Event-B component interfaces and propose to use a diagrammatic representation of component instances (based on iUML-B) which can be used to describe the relationships between the composed elements. We also discuss the specification of communication flow across component boundaries and describe the additional proof obligations that are required.   

 Using B and ProB for Data Validation Projects    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.167-182 

 Constraint satisfaction and data validation problems can be expressed very elegantly in state-based formal methods such as B. However, is B suited for developing larger applications and are there existing tools that scale for these projects? In this paper, we present our experiences on two real-world data validation projects from different domains which are based on the B language and use ProB as the central validation tool. The first project is the validation of university timetables, and the second project is the validation of railway topologies. Based on these two projects, we present a general structure of a data validation project in B and outline common challenges along with various solutions. We also discuss possible evolutions of the B language to make it (even) more suitable for such projects.

 Generating Event-B Specifications from Algorithm Descriptions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.183-197 

 We present a high-level algorithm description language which is translated to Event-B specifications for simulation, model checking and proof. Rather than trying to recover the program structure from a lower-level Event-B specification, we start with a high-level description of the algorithm. Our goals are more tractable code generation and more convenient modelling, while keeping the power of the Event-B method in terms of proof and refinement. We present various examples of algorithm descriptions and show that our translation ensures that they can be completely proven within Rodin while achieving a high-level of automatic proof.   

 Formal Proofs of Termination Detection for Local Computations by Refinement-Based Compositions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.198-212 

 In this paper, we propose a formal framework enhancing the termination detection property of distributed algorithms and reusing their specifications as well as their proofs. By relying on refinement and composition, we show that an algorithm specified with local termination detection, can be reused in order to compute the same algorithm with global termination detection. The main idea relies upon the development of distributed algorithms following a top/down approach and the integration of additional computation steps developed in a pre-defined module. This module is specified in a generic and scalable way in order to be composed with particular developments. Once the composition link is proven, the global termination emerges automatically.   

 How to Select the Suitable Formal Method for an Industrial Application: A Survey    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.213-228 

 The share of formal methods is still marginal in contemporary systems and software engineering. One of the reasons is the absence of systematic guidelines and evaluation criteria that help software practitioners choose the right formal method for the problem at hand. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of criteria, based on a systematic literature review and decade-long personal experience in industrial projects, for evaluating and comparing different formal methods. We argue that besides technical grounds (e.g., modeling capabilities and supported development phases), formal methods should also be evaluated from social and industrial perspectives. At the end of the paper, we present an evaluation of “ABZ” methods based on the stipulated criteria.   

 Unified Syntax for Abstract State Machines    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.231-236 

 The paper presents our efforts in defining UASM, a unified syntax for Abstract State Machines (ASMs), based on the syntaxes of two of the main ASM frameworks, CoreASM and ASMETA, which have been adapted to accept UASM as input syntax of all their validation and verification tools.   

 A Relational Encoding for a Clash-Free Subset of ASMs    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.237-243 

 This paper defines a static check for clash-freedom of ASM rules, including sequential and parallel composition, nondeterministic choice, and recursion. The check computes a formula that, if provable, makes a relational encoding of ASM rules possible, which is an important prerequisite for efficient deduction. The check is general enough to cover all sequential rules as well as many typical uses of parallel composition.   

 Towards an ASM Thesis for Reflective Sequential Algorithms    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.244-249 

 Starting from Gurevich’s thesis for sequential algorithms (the so-called “sequential ASM thesis”), we propose a characterization of the behaviour of sequential algorithms enriched with reflection. That is, we present a set of postulates which we conjecture capture the fundamental properties of reflective sequential algorithms (RSAs). Then we look at the plausibility of an ASM thesis for the class of RSAs, defining a model of abstract state machine (which we call reflective ASM) that we conjecture captures the class of RSAs as defined by our postulates.   

 A Model-Based Transformation Approach to Reuse and Retarget CASM Specifications    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z - 5th International Conference, ABZ 2016 
  pp.250-255 

 The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a way to specify algorithms, applications and systems in a formal model. Recent ASM languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a specific environment. In this work-in-progress paper we outline a model-based transformation approach supporting (1) the specification of applications or systems using the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language and (2) retargeting those applications to different programming language and hardware target domains. An intermediate model is introduced, which not only captures software-based implementations, but also the generation of hardware-related code in the same model. This approach offers a new formal modeling perspective onto modular, reusable and retargetable software and hardware designs for the development of embedded systems. We provide a short overview of our CASM compiler design as well as the retargetable model-based approach to generate code for different target domains.   

 Modeling a Discrete Wet-Dry Algorithm for Hurricane Storm Surge in Alloy    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.256-261 

 We describe an Alloy model that helps check the correctness of a discrete wet-dry algorithm used in a system for hurricane storm surge prediction. Derived from simplified physics and encoded with empirical rules, the algorithm operates on a finite element mesh to allow the propagation of overland flows. Our study is motivated by complex interactions between the algorithm and a recent performance enhancement to the system that involves mesh partitioning. We briefly outline our approach and describe safety properties of the extension, as well as directions for future work.   

 ‘The Tinker’ for Rodin    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.262-268 

 PSGraph [3] is a graphical proof strategy language, which uses the formalisation of labelled hierarchical graphs to provide support for the development and maintenance of large and complex proof tactics. PSGraph has been implemented as the Tinker system, which previously supported the Isabelle and ProofPower theorem provers [4]. In this paper we present a Rodin version of Tinker, which allows Rodin users to encode, analyse and debug their proof strategies in Tinker.   

 A Graphical Tool for Event Refinement Structures in Event-B    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference, ABZ 2016, Linz, Austria, May 23-27, 2016 

 The Event Refinement Structures (ERS) approach provides a graphical extension of the Event-B formal method to represent event decomposition and control-flow explicitly. In this paper we present an improved version of the ERS plug-in, which provides a graphical environment for the ERS approach within the Event-B tool, Rodin. The improved ERS plug-in is based on the available frameworks that are developed to support Event-B with an EMF framework, language extensions and generic diagram extensions.   

 Rodin Platform Why3 Plug-In    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.275-281 

 We briefly present the motivation, architecture and usage experience as well as proof statistics for a new Rodin Platform proof back-end based on the Why3 umbrella prover. Why3 offers a simple and versatile notation as a common interface to a large number of automated provers including all the leading SMT-LIB and TPTP compliant tools. The plug-in can function either in a local mode when all the provers are installed locally, or remotely as a cloud service. We discuss the experience of building the tool, the current status and the potential advantages of a cloud-hosted proof infrastructure.   

 Semi-Automated Design Space Exploration for Formal Modelling    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Mar 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 

 Refinement based formal methods allow the modelling of systems through incremental steps via abstraction. Discovering the right levels of abstraction, formulating correct and meaningful invariants, and analysing faulty models are some of the challenges faced when using this technique. Here, we propose Design Space Exploration, an approach that aims to assist a designer by automatically providing high-level modelling guidance in real-time. More specifically, through the combination of common patterns of modelling with techniques from automated theory formation and automated reasoning, different design alternatives are explored and suitable models that deal with faults are proposed.   

 Handling Continuous Functions in Hybrid Systems Reconfigurations: A Formal Event-B Development    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.290-296 

 This paper presents a substitution mechanism for systems having a continuous behavior. It shall preserve the safety property stating that the output of both systems remain in a safety envelope. The whole approach is formalized using Event-B, and relies on the Rodin tools and a theory of Reals provided by the Rodin Theory Plug-in to check the internal consistency with respect to safety properties, invariants and events.   

 UC-B: Use Case Modelling with Event-B    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.297-302 

 Use cases are a popular but informal technique used to define and analyse system behaviour. We introduce UC-B a plug-in for the Rodin platform (Event-B tool) that supports the authoring and management of use case specifications with both informal and formal components. The formal component is based on Event-B’s mathematical language. Once the behaviour of the use case is specified, UC-B automatically generates a corresponding Event-B model. The resulting model is then amenable to the Rodin verification tools that enable system level properties to be verified. By underpinning informal use case modelling with Event-B we are able to provide greater precision and formal assurance during the early stages of design.   

 Interactive Model Repair by Synthesis    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.303-307 

 When using B or Event-B for formal specifications, model checking is often used to detect errors such as invariant violations, deadlocks or refinement errors. Errors are presented as counter-example states and traces and should help fixing the underlying bugs. We suggest automating parts of this process: Using a synthesis technique, we try to generate more permissive or restrictive guards or invariants. Furthermore, synthesized actions allow to modify the behaviour of the model. All this could be done with constant user feedback, yielding an interactive debugging aid.   

 SysML2B: Automatic Tool for B Project Graphical Architecture Design Using SysML    
   
 Conference Paper

  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.308-311 

 We present an approach to transform SysML structural diagrams, BDD and IBD with constraints, into a B Method project skeleton. This project can then be directly used for implementation development through usual B refinement mechanism. We prototyped this approach.

 Mechanized Refinement of Communication Models with TLA $$^+$$ +    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.312-318 

 In distributed systems, asynchronous communication is often viewed as a whole whereas there are actually many different interaction protocols whose properties are involved in the compatibility of peer compositions. A hierarchy of asynchronous communication models, based on refinements, is established and proven with the TLA\(^+\) Proof System. The work serves as a first step in the study of the substituability of the communication models when it comes to compatibility checking.

 The ClawZ toolset has been successful in verifying that Ada code is correctly generated from Simulink models in an industrial setting, using the Z notation. D-RisQ is now extending this technique to new domains of the C programming language, which requires changes to their highly complex proof technique. In this paper, we present initial results in the technology transfer of the graphical PSGraph language to support this extension, and show feasibility of PSGraph for industrial use with strong maintainability requirements.

 How to Assure Correctness and Safety of Medical Software: The Hemodialysis Machine Case Study    
   
 Conference Paper

  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.344-359 

 Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients. Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper takes advantage of the Hemodialysis machine case study to present a formal development process supporting most of the engineering activities required by the standards, and provides rigorous approaches for system validation and verification. The process is based on the Abstract State Machine formal method and its model refinement principle.   

 Validating the Requirements and Design of a Hemodialysis Machine Using iUML-B, BMotion Studio, and Co-Simulation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  ABZ 2016 
  pp.360-375 

 We present a formal specification of a hemodialysis machine (HD machine) using Event-B. We model the HD machine using iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams and build a corresponding BMotion Studio visualisation. We focus on validation using (i) diagrams to aid the modelling of the sequential properties of the requirements, and (ii) ProB-based animation and visualisation tools to explore the system’s behaviour. Some of the safety properties involve dynamic behaviour which is difficult to verify in Event-B. For these properties we use co-simulation tools to validate against a continuous model of the physical behaviour.   

 Hemodialysis Machine in Hybrid Event-B    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2016 
  International Conference on Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z 
  pp.376-393 

 The hemodialysis machine case study is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state). A broadly component based strategy is adopted, using the multi-machine and coordination facilities of Hybrid Event-B. Since, like most medical procedures, hemodialysis is under overall human control, it is largely a sequential process, with some branching to deal with exceptional circumstances. This makes for a relatively uncomplicated modelling framework, provided a model of the operator is included in order to capture the handling of exceptions.

 This paper presents the specification of the hemodialysis case study, proposed by ABZ’16 conference. The specification was carried out by a coupling of Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (astd) and B-like methods. astd are a graphical notation, based on automata and process algebra operators. They provide an easy-to-read specification of the dynamic behaviour of the system. The data model is specified using the Event-B language. The system is incrementally designed using extended refinement of both methods.

 We present a formal model of aspects of the haemodialysis machine case study using the Circus specification notation. We focus on building a model in which each of the software requirements (R-1–36) are represented by a Circus action. All of these act in concert with actions that model the collection of sensor data and the progress through the various therapy phases and activities. We then present how we model check the system using FDR.

 ... RISCAL is not the first attempt to apply model checking technology in formal modeling: various other modeling languages support checking respectively counterexample generation [6]  , differing from RISCAL mainly in the application domain of the language and/or the exhaustiveness of the analysis. The development of RISCAL has been very much inspired by the TLA Toolbox which incorporates a model checker for a subset of TLA+ [11]; also the use of unspecified constants as model bounds has been inspired by this toolkit. ...

 The RISC Algorithm Language (RISCAL) is a language for the formal modeling of theories and algorithms. A RISCAL specification describes an infinite class of models each of which has finite size; this allows to fully automatically check in such a model the validity of all theorems and the correctness of all algorithms. RISCAL thus enables us to quickly verify/falsify the specific truth of propositions in sample instances of a model class before attempting to prove their general truth in the whole class: the first can be achieved in a fully automatic way while the second typically requires our assistance. RISCAL has been mainly developed for educational purposes. To this end this paper reports on some new enhancements of the tool: the automatic generation of checkable verification conditions from algorithms, the visualization of the execution of procedures and the evaluation of formulas illustrating the computation of their results, and the generation of Web-based student exercises and assignments from RISCAL specifications. Furthermore, we report on our first experience with RISCAL in the teaching of courses on logic and formal methods and on further plans to use this tool to enhance formal education.

 The use of formal methods is often recommended to guarantee the provision of necessary services and to assess the correctness of critical properties, such as functional safety, cybersecurity, and reliability, in medical and health care devices. In the past, several formal and rigorous methods have been proposed and consequently applied for trustworthy development of medical software and systems. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review on the available state of the art in this domain. We collect the relevant literature on the use of formal methods for modeling, design, development, verification, and validation of software-intensive medical systems. We apply standard systematic literature review techniques and run several queries in well-known repositories to obtain information that can be useful for people who are either already working in this field or planning to start. Our study covers both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the subject.

 RISCAL is a language for describing mathematical algorithms and formally specifying their behavior with respect to user-defined theories in first-order logic. This language is based on a type system that constrains the size of all types by formal parameters; thus a RISCAL specification denotes an infinite class of models of which every instance has finite size. This allows the RISCAL software to fully automatically check in small instances the validity of theorems and the correctness of algorithms. Our goal is to quickly detect errors respectively inadequacies in the formalization by falsification in small model instances before attempting actual correctness proofs for the whole model class.

  A hybrid system is a dynamical system whose state has both a discrete component, which is updated in a sequence of steps, and a continuous component, which evolves over time. Hybrid systems are a useful modeling tool in a variety of situations, including the embedded (digital) control of physical (analog) plants, robotics, circuits, biology, and finance. We survey a computational approach to the ... [Show full abstract]  verification and control of hybrid systems which is based on the symbolic discretization of continuous state changes. On the theoretical side, we classify infinite, hybrid state spaces as to which finite, discrete abstractions they admit. This classification enables us to apply concepts and results from concurrency theory, model checking, and game theory to hybrid systems. On the practical side, we discuss several options for implementing the symbolic approach to hybrid systems, and point to existing tool support.

  We address the problem of model checking hybrid systems which exhibit nontrivial discrete behavior and thus cannot be treated by considering the discrete states one by one, as most currently available verification tools do. Our procedure relies on a deep integration of several techniques and tools. An extension of AND-Inverter-Graphs (AIGs) with first-order constraints serves as a compact ... [Show full abstract]  representation format for sets of configurations which are composed of continuous regions and discrete states. Boolean reasoning on the AIGs is complemented by first-order reasoning in various forms and on various levels. These include implication checks for simple constraints, test vector generation for fast inequality checks of boolean combinations of constraints, and an exact subsumption check for representations of two configurations. These techniques are integrated within a model checker for universal CTL. Technically, it deals with discrete-time hybrid systems with linear differentials. The paper presents the approach, its prototype implementation, and first experimental data.

DSVerifier determines the control system stability, considering all the plant interval variation set, together with the Finite Word-length (FWL) effects in the digital controller implementation; DSVerifier checks the robust non-fragile stability of a given closed-loop system. The proposed methodology and respective tool are evaluated considering non-fragile control examples from literature. Experimental results show that the approach used in this study is able to foresee fragility problems in robust controllers, which could be overlooked by other existing approaches due to underestimating of FWL effects.

  As more computing systems are utilized in various areas of our society, the reliability of computing systems becomes a significant issue. However, as the complexity of computing systems increases, conventional verification and validation techniques such as testing and model checking have limitations to assess reliability of complex safety critical systems. Such systems often control highly ... [Show full abstract]  complex continuous dynamics to interact with physical environments. To assure the reliability of safety critical hybrid systems, statistical model checking (SMC) techniques have been proposed. SMC techniques approximately compute probabilities for a target system to satisfy given requirements based on randomly sampled execution traces. In this paper, we empirically evaluated four state-ofthe- art SMC techniques on a fault-tolerant fuel control system in the automobile domain. Through the experiments, we could demonstrate that SMC is practically useful to assure the reliability of a safety critical hybrid system and we compared pros and cons of the four different SMC techniques.

  Hybrid systems are well-suited as a design and modeling framework to describe the interaction of discrete controllers with a continuous environment. However, the systems described are often complex and so are the resulting models. Therefore, a formal framework and a formal verification to prove the correctness of system properties is highly desirable. Since complexity is inherent, standard formal ...

In this work we present several options how to tackle the complexity arising in the formal verification of hybrid systems.

 AAAI Classic Paper Award  
  
 The AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of paper(s) deemed most influential, chosen from a specific conference year. Each year, the time period considered will advance by one year. The 2025 award will be given to the most influential paper(s) from the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  
 Papers will be judged on the basis of impact, for example:  
 Started a new research (sub)area 
  Led to important applications 
  Answered a long-standing question/issue or clarified what had been murky 
  Made a major advance that figures in the history of the subarea 
  Has been picked up as important and used by other areas within (or outside of) AI 
  Has been very heavily cited 
  All members of the artificial intelligence community are encouraged to submit nominations for this award. Candidacy is not limited to AAAI members, nor to people still active in artificial intelligence. Posthumous awards will be considered.  
 Nominations will be reviewed by the AAAI Awards Committee. Nominations are due September 20, 2024.  
 The award will be presented at the AAAI-25 conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. A total of $1,000 in travel support is available to enable the author(s) to travel to the conference to accept the award in person.  
 For more information regarding these awards, please contact AAAI ( awards@aaai.org  ).

 AAAI-25 Submission Instructions  
   
 Submission Site for AAAI-25 Main Track, AI Alignment, and AI for Social Impact Track    

 Author Registration  
 Authors must register at the AAAI-25 web-based technical track paper submission site before they can submit abstracts and papers. To avoid last-minute congestion, authors are encouraged to register well in advance of the abstract deadline. Authors are required to use the same OpenReview account (i.e., associated with the same email address) across all submissions and review assignments.  
 IMPORTANT: Authors must enter the names of ALL AUTHORS at the time of registration (by abstract deadline) — OpenReview includes a hard-coded note that this is optional, however, this is a mandatory step for AAAI-25 authors. According to AAAI policy, all author names must be added at the time of abstract registration, and the list of names as well as the order in which they appear cannot be changed after August 15. In addition, the contact author and contact information cannot be changed after the abstract submission deadline. For the complete policy on Guidelines for Changes to Titles/Authors after Submissions, please see below.  
 Given the size of the conference, all authors of AAAI-25 submissions will be expected to join the conference’s reviewer pool unless prevented by extenuating circumstances. Potential reviewers will be vetted based on their research experience, and depending on this experience may be selected as program committee or senior program committee members.  
 Abstract and Paper Submission  
 Every submission requires both an abstract submission and a corresponding paper submission. For regular papers, abstracts must be submitted by August 7, 2024 and full papers must be submitted by August 15, 2024. There will be no individual exceptions. If you experience any technical problems with the OpenReview site, please contact the AAAI-25 Workflow Chairs at workflowchairs25@aaai.zendesk.com  .  
 Submissions will not be accepted by e-mail or any other mechanism other than OpenReview. After submission, the system will not automatically send a confirmation of receipt. If you want to receive a confirmation email, please click the paper ID to view the submission, and then click the “Email” button at the top right to send the confirmation to yourself or all the authors. AAAI will contact authors again only if problems are encountered with papers. We intend to close the submission system exactly at the deadline. Once the deadline has passed, we regret that we will be unable to make individual exceptions or to correspond with authors regarding circumstances that prevented timely submission.  
 At the time of abstract submission, authors should include a full title for their paper and a complete abstract in the fields provided. Submissions that have “placeholder” (e.g., test or xyz) titles or abstracts (or none at all) will be deleted. Authors of such vacuous submissions will be notified that their abstract has been deleted and will not be allowed to submit a full paper. The Program Chairs also reserve the right to reject papers without review if they change their abstracts substantially between the abstract and final deadlines.  
 Papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style; see the AAAI-25 author kit for details.  Papers must be in trouble-free, high-resolution PDF format, formatted for US Letter (8.5″ x 11″) paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts. AAAI submissions are anonymous and must conform to the instructions (detailed below) for double-blind review. The authors must remove all author and affiliation information from their submission for review, and may replace it with other information, such as paper number and keywords. Submissions may consist of up to 7 pages of technical content plus additional pages solely for references; acknowledgements should be omitted from papers submitted for review.  
  Only PDF files are required at the time of submission for review; authors will additionally need to submit paper source files if their paper is accepted for publication.  
 Submission Limit per Author  
 Each individual author is limited to no more than a combined limit of 10 submissions to the AAAI-25 technical track (including papers in the AI Alignment and AI for Social Impact tracks) and authors may not be added to papers following submission (see below for policies about author changes).  
 Guidelines for Changes to Titles/Authors after Submissions  
 MODIFICATIONS TO SUBMISSIONS ARE ONLY ALLOWED UNTIL THE FULL PAPER DEADLINE (August 15 for Phase 1 submissions). No exceptions will be granted. Please see the full policy on Paper Modification Guidelines  .  
 Policy Concerning Multiple Submissions to Conferences or Journals  
 AAAI-25 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in any archival venue such as a journal or a conference (workshops and preprint servers such as arXiv are acceptable). Authors are free to retract a submission from a venue with a concurrent review process (e.g., from NeurIPS-24) and submit the same work to AAAI-25 as a regular paper, provided that this retraction occurs before the AAAI-25 submission. Authors must confirm at the time of submission that the paper is not under review at another archival conference or journal.  
 Once they have made a submission to AAAI-25, authors may not submit the same paper to another archival conference or journal until they receive an accept/reject decision from AAAI-25 or they withdraw their submission from AAAI-25. In some cases, it may require a judgment call to determine whether two concurrent submissions constitute a violation of AAAI’s multiple submission policy. If a concern is raised about the similarity of two non-identical submissions, at least three people will inspect whatever information is available about both submissions. If they all agree that the simultaneous submission has excessive technical overlap, the paper will be summarily rejected and the organizers of the other conference will be informed about AAAI’s decision. As with all summary rejects, such decisions are final.  
 Citation and Comparison  
 Papers are expected to cite those refereed publications most relevant to their content, but authors are excused for not knowing about all non-refereed work (e.g, appearing on arXiv). Nevertheless, in cases where such prior work is widely known in the field, its existence may be considered by reviewers in assessing a submission’s novelty. Papers published less than two months before the regular paper submission deadline (August 15, 2024) are considered contemporaneous to all AAAI-25 submissions (whether submitted as regular or fast track submissions); authors are not obliged to address such papers (though, especially for the camera ready versions of accepted papers, authors are encouraged to do so).  
 Reproducibility Guidelines  
 Authors must complete a reproducibility checklist  at the time of paper submission, which outlines how to reproduce the results of the submission. Please include your answers in your PDF after the references. There is no separate submission for the checklist, simply add that to your main submission after the reference. This will not count toward the page limit. These responses will become part of each paper submission and will be shared with reviewers.  
 Information related to reproducing experimental results described in the submission may be included in the main paper or the Code and Data Appendix, as appropriate. Further technical details (proofs, descriptions of assumptions, algorithm pseudocode) may be included in the Technical Appendix. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include detailed information about each reproducibility criterion as part of their Technical Appendix. Reviewers will be asked to assess the degree to which the results reported in a paper are reproducible, and this assessment will be weighed when making final decisions about each paper.  
 Ethics Policy  
 All AAAI authors and reviewers are required to honor the AAAI Publications Ethics and Malpractice Statement  , as well as the AAAI Code of Professional Conduct  . A paper may be rejected if an author is found to violate the AAAI Publications Ethics and Malpractice Statement or the AAAI Code of Professional Conduct.  
 Demonstrations  
 During paper submission, authors will be able to express interest in giving a public demo of systems described in the paper. Based on these expressions of interest and on reviews, papers will be selected to participate in a demonstration session, which will happen in addition to technical talks and posters.

 AAAI Classic Paper Award  
  
 The AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of paper(s) deemed most influential, chosen from a specific conference year. Each year, the time period considered will advance by one year. The 2025 award will be given to the most influential paper(s) from the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  
 Papers will be judged on the basis of impact, for example:  
 Started a new research (sub)area 
  Led to important applications 
  Answered a long-standing question/issue or clarified what had been murky 
  Made a major advance that figures in the history of the subarea 
  Has been picked up as important and used by other areas within (or outside of) AI 
  Has been very heavily cited 
  All members of the artificial intelligence community are encouraged to submit nominations for this award. Candidacy is not limited to AAAI members, nor to people still active in artificial intelligence. Posthumous awards will be considered.  
 Nominations will be reviewed by the AAAI Awards Committee. Nominations are due September 20, 2024.  
 The award will be presented at the AAAI-25 conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. A total of $1,000 in travel support is available to enable the author(s) to travel to the conference to accept the award in person.  
 For more information regarding these awards, please contact AAAI ( awards@aaai.org  ).

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

 AAAI Classic Paper Award  
  
 The AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of paper(s) deemed most influential, chosen from a specific conference year. Each year, the time period considered will advance by one year. The 2025 award will be given to the most influential paper(s) from the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  
 Papers will be judged on the basis of impact, for example:  
 Started a new research (sub)area 
  Led to important applications 
  Answered a long-standing question/issue or clarified what had been murky 
  Made a major advance that figures in the history of the subarea 
  Has been picked up as important and used by other areas within (or outside of) AI 
  Has been very heavily cited 
  All members of the artificial intelligence community are encouraged to submit nominations for this award. Candidacy is not limited to AAAI members, nor to people still active in artificial intelligence. Posthumous awards will be considered.  
 Nominations will be reviewed by the AAAI Awards Committee. Nominations are due September 20, 2024.  
 The award will be presented at the AAAI-25 conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. A total of $1,000 in travel support is available to enable the author(s) to travel to the conference to accept the award in person.

 Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z  

 M. Butler, K.-D. Schewe, A. Mashkoor, M. Biró (ed.): Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference, ABZ 2016, Linz, Austria, May 23-27, 2016, Springer International Publishing 426 p, 2016, Lecture Notes in Computer Science; 9675, ISBN:978-3-319-33599-52016,  
  doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8    
  
  At ABZ 2016 four keynotes were presented. Egon Börger from the University of Pisa presented his research on modelling distributed algorithms using the ASM method in comparison with Petri nets. Richard Banach from the University of Manchester shed light on rigorous specification and refinement of hybrid and cyber-physical systems. Thierry Lecomte from Clearsy presented recent developments in Atelier-B. Klaus Reichl from Thales Austria addressed the rigorous modelling of safety-critical railway applications. In addition to these keynotes, the conference offered two tutorials on hybrid systems development and business process modelling with rigorous methods, which were given by Richard Banach and Bernhard Thalheim together with Felix Kossak, respectively. We are grateful to the four invited speakers and the tutorial presenters for contributing to the success of ABZ 2016. After the successful installment of a case study track at ABZ 2014 addressing a “landing gear system” to be modelled with state-based rigorous methods, ABZ 2016 offered another challenging case study addressing a hemodialysis machine. ABZ 2016 received 61 submissions covering the whole spectrum of rigorous methods within the scope of the conference. These papers ranged from fundamental contributions, applications in industrial contexts, tool developments and improvements, and contributions to the case study. Each paper was reviewed by at least four reviewers and the Program Committee accepted 12 regular research papers, 15 short papers presenting work in progress and five papers on the case study.

 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)  
 Area Chairs  : Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster  
 Topics  :  
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised and representation learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Multiagent learning 
  Evolutionary algorithms 
  Learning agent capabilities 
  Learning agent-to-agent interactions

  Adversarial learning 
  Description  : Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication.  
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)

  Agreement Technologies: Negotiation and Argumentations 
  Responsible socio-technical systems 
  Description  : Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned. We encourage the submission of papers that highlight the design, development, evaluation, simulation, and analysis of novel, innovative, and impactful research on issues related to the above topics.  
 Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS)  
 Area Chairs  : William Yeoh, Sven Koenig  
 Topics  :  
 Single-agent planning and scheduling 
  Multiagent planning and scheduling 
  Decentralized planning and scheduling 
  Planning under uncertainty 
  Combinatorial optimization 
  Constraint programming 
  Distributed constraint reasoning 
  Resource and task allocation 
  Non-strategic coalition formation 
  Description  : This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to search, optimization, planning, and scheduling in single- and multi-agent systems. Important subfields include decentralized planning, planning under uncertainty, combinatorial optimization, distributed constraint reasoning, resource and task allocation, and non-strategic coalition formation. Machine learning approaches as well as foundation models for planning and scheduling are encouraged. Likewise, all approaches to single- and multi-agent planning, including motion and path planning, and their interplay with other agent components are relevant.  
 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)  
 Area Chairs  : Natasha Alechina, Aparna Taneja, Alessio Lomuscio  
 Topics  :  
 Computer vision 
  Representation learning and generative AI 
  Neurosymbolic approaches 
  Argumentation 
  Agent theories and models 
  Explainability 
  Logics for agent reasoning 
  Ontologies for agents 
  Reasoning about knowledge, beliefs, goals, actions, plans, and change in multiagent systems 
  Reasoning and problem solving in agent-based systems 
  Verification of agents and multiagent systems 
  Description  : This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning in single-agent and multi-agent systems. Knowledge representation is to be understood broadly, ranging from theoretical contributions (e.g., epistemic, strategic, description, and other logics) to representation learning. Moreover, representation and reasoning in complex settings often entails reasoning about sensing and perception. Relevant forms of reasoning include, for instance, automated reasoning and theorem proving approaches, verification-based approaches, as well as probabilistic reasoning and neurosymbolic approaches, as long as they are applied to, or motivated by reasoning about agents and/or multiagent systems.  
 Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS)  
 Area Chairs:  Viviana Mascardi, Daniela Briola  
 Topics:   
 Requirements and formal specification 
  Architecture and modeling 
  Formal verification and validation

Contributions that demonstrate the benefit of such abstractions and methodologies for interesting application domains and other technological paradigms are also welcome. Naturally, the scope of this area spans the entire software engineering lifecycle — from requirements and verification to testing, validation, and evolution.  
 Modeling and Simulation of (Artificial) Societies (SIM)  
 Area Chairs  : Ana Bazzan, Samarth Swarup  
 Topics  :  
 Analysis of agent-based simulations

  Social simulation 
  Validation of social simulation systems 
  Description  : Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs.  
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)  
 Area Chairs  : Michael Goodrich, Birgit Lugrin  
 Topics  :  
 Human-agent interaction 
  Agent-based analysis of human interactions 
  Socially interactive agents 
  Trust and explainability in human-agent interactions 
  Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
  Social robotics and social interactions 
  Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
  Groups of humans and agents 
  Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
  Designing for human-agent interaction 
  Virtual humans 
  Description  :  
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction.

We invite papers that advance theory and/or application of single and multiple robots, with particular emphasis on solutions based on realistic assumptions typically encountered in robotic applications. All papers at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence (and agent research, specifically) are in the scope of the robotics area at AAMAS.  
 Innovative Applications (IA)  
 Area Chairs  : Thanh Nguyen, Pradeep Varakantham  
 Topics  :  
 Deployed or emerging applications of agent-based systems 
  Realistic agent-based models of human organizations 
  Evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of agent-based systems 
  Integrated applications of agent-based and other technologies 
  Challenges and best practices of real-world deployments of agent-based technologies 
  Description  : The innovative applications area aims to showcase successful applications and novel uses of agent-based technologies. We encourage research on emerging areas of agent-based applications with measurable benefits, on various topics such as (but not limited to) social good, sustainability, and ethical AI. The innovative applications area is keen to attract research that is not only triggered by real-world applications, but provides realistic beneficial solutions for these applications. Collaborations with relevant stakeholders is highly valued, as it helps demonstrate the feasibility and impact of the work.  
 Special Tracks  
 In addition to the main track, AAMAS 2025 will feature four special tracks: the AAAI Resubmissions Track   , the Blue Sky Ideas Track   , the JAAMAS Track  , and the Demo Track  , each with a separate Call for Papers (to be posted when available).  
 The focus of the Blue Sky Ideas Track is on visionary ideas, long-term challenges, new research opportunities, and controversial debate. The JAAMAS Track offers authors of papers recently published in the journal Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems  (JAAMAS) that have not previously appeared as full papers in an archival conference the opportunity to present their work at AAMAS 2025. The Demo Track, finally, allows participants from both academia and industry to showcase their latest developments in agent-based and robotic systems.

 1. SAC 2025  
 In the last thirty-nine years, ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has been a primary and international forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineering, and other computer related professionals to gather, interact, present, and disseminate their research and development work. ACM SAC has been sponsored by the Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and SIGAPP’s mission is to further the interests of the computing professionals engaged in the development of new computing techniques and applications areas and the transfer of computing technology to new problem domains.  
 SAC 2025 will be held on March 31 – April 4, 2025 in Sicily, Italy. The conference proceedings will be published by ACM and will be also available online through ACM’s Digital Library. For additional information, please visit the above official ACM SAC 2025 web site.  
 2. Special Track on Databases and Big Data Management (DBDM)  
 For many years, the Database Theory, Technology, and Applications track has been one of the important parts of the ACM SAC conference. To support ACM SAC, we have successfully organized the Database Theory, Technology, and Applications tracks (2005-2018) and Databases and Big Data Management Track (2019-2024) under the leadership and guidance of ACM SAC Organization Committees in the past. We strongly believe that this track will still be a very important, interesting, and beneficia forum for various database scientists, researchers, engineers, and practitioners from all over the world to exchange their great ideas, to share their research experiences, and to disseminate their research results. Taking into account the current trends in research and technology related to Big Data Management, we would like to propose a small change in the title as well as in the main topics of the track. Our proposal is the “Databases and Big Data Management” (DBDM) track, which aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with different backgrounds related to data management in general.

 4. Guidelines for Paper Submission  
 Original papers from the above-mentioned or other related areas will be considered. This includes three categories of submissions: 1) original and unpublished research; 2) reports of innovative computing applications in the arts, sciences, engineering, business, government, education and industry; and 3) reports of successful technology transfer to new problem domains.  
 Each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a double-blind review process by at least three referees for quality, correctness, originality, and relevance. Notification and reviews will be communicated via email. All papers must be submitted electronically in the format of Adobe PDF and Postscript (preferably) or MS Word. Please, upload your papers electronically to the website:  
 http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2025/Paper-SubmissionUploadPage.htm   
 Author(s) name(s) and address(es) must NOT appear in the paper body. Any self-reference should be in the third person. The paper length is 8 pages + 2 pages at extra charge (max of 10 pages). The program committee may reject papers that exceed this length on the grounds of length alone. In addition, for each submitted paper, a separated cover page (preferably in MS Word or plain ASCII) should be sent to the email address:  
 sac2025@delab.csd.auth.gr   
 including the paper title, abstract, list of key words, and list of authors with full names and postal addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses. One of the authors must be designated as the primary contact point to receive the notification at the time of the paper submission.  
 If your submitted manuscript gets accepted by ACM SAC 2025, the final camera-ready copy must follow the template provided ACM SAC 2025. The template can be downloaded from the URL:  
 https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2025/   
 At least one of the authors of the accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper, and the final camera-ready copies of accepted papers must fit within eight (8) two-column pages, with the option to add two pages at an additional charge. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2025 proceedings.  
 Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM digital library.  
 A set of selected papers, which did not get accepted as full papers, will be accepted as poster papers and will also be published as extended three (3) two-column pages’ abstracts in the ACM SAC 2025 proceedings (with the option to add an additional page at an additional charge).

 Call For Workshop Proposals  
 Workshop Chairs:   
 Vineeth Balasubramanian (IIT-Hyderabad)   
 Anh Tran (VinAI Research)   
 Proposal Deadline:  June 9, 2024    
   Notification by:  June 30, 2024   
 Email  : accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com    
 We are soliciting proposals for in-person workshops to be held together with the 17th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Workshops — co-located with ACML 2024 – will take place on the 8th and 9th of December, 2024.   
 The purpose of workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on emerging topics that will not be fully explored in the main conference and to encourage in-­depth discussion of various technical and application, and community issues in computer vision. We also welcome “Challenge Workshops” that aim to compare new and established methods on common data sets. Workshop registration, venue, as well as proceedings will be handled as part of the main conference by the ACCV organizers.   
 The selection process for workshop space, time and topic coverage will be competitive. We will consider topic coverage, the proposers’ credentials, the interested audience, and relevance of the topic in the selection process. Please note that proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify aspects of their proposals, or merge their proposal with other ones.   
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format (max 4 pages without references, single-column, not less than 10.5 font size) by email to the workshop chairs (  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   ) by  May 31, 2024 (23:59 AoE time)   . The candidate workshop organizers will be notified of the decision by June 30, 2024.  When preparing a proposal, please note that ACCV regular paper acceptance notification is on September 20, 2024.    
 The proposals should include the following information:   
 1. TECHNICAL INFORMATION   
 Workshop title 
  Topics that will be covered, with descriptions of why they are relevant. 
  Description of how this proposal relates to the workshops at previous ACCV and CVPR/ICCV/ECCV etc. (be as specific as possible). 
   
 2. ORGANIZERS AND SPEAKERS   
 Organizers’ names, titles and affiliations, with one, potentially two, contact emails of reliably responsive organizers. 
  Background and experience that makes the proposers well-suited for organizing the workshop, including brief biographies. 
  In case this event is part of a workshop series, please provide URLs to the web pages of relevant past events and/or any other relevant information. 
  List of invited speakers. Please list only speakers that confirmed or tentatively confirmed their attendance. For each speaker, please indicate if confirmation is tentative or final. 
  3. LOGISTICS   
 Preference for half-day or full-day event (Note that your workshop may be accepted as a half-day event due to space limitation regardless of your request in proposal.) 
  Tentative program committee. 
  Please indicate one of the following options describing the nature of your event: | Workshop is primarily an invited speaker event 
  Workshop is primarily a peer-reviewed paper event (orals/posters) 
  Workshop will have a roughly even split between invited speakers and peer-reviewed papers 
  Please also indicate if you plan to run a competition with your workshop. 
  If relevant, please provide a paper review timeline. 
  If the workshop includes peer-reviewed papers, will these papers be published in proceedings? (If the answer is yes, you may need to follow the publication schedule of the main conference.) 
  If posters are considered, how many are expected? Note that the conference may limit the number of posters based on available space. 
  Special space or equipment requests, if any. 
  4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   
 After acceptance, workshops will be required to prepare their own websites, separate from the ACCV 2024 webpage. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions and, once finalized, the workshop program. 
  Accepted workshops must provide their program material using a conference Google sheet for producing program/app information. 
  Since ACML 2024 and ACCV 2024 are co-located, please confirm whether you’d be okay if this workshop is shared between the two conferences (Note that workshop chairs will make the final decision on this, based on the overall conference logistics). 
  Additional Contact Information:  
 Note that all workshops are to be in-person. For any questions, please contact the workshop chairs via email at:  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   .

 Call For Workshop Proposals  
 Workshop Chairs:   
 Vineeth Balasubramanian (IIT-Hyderabad)   
 Anh Tran (VinAI Research)   
 Proposal Deadline:  June 9, 2024    
   Notification by:  June 30, 2024   
 Email  : accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com    
 We are soliciting proposals for in-person workshops to be held together with the 17th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Workshops — co-located with ACML 2024 – will take place on the 8th and 9th of December, 2024.   
 The purpose of workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on emerging topics that will not be fully explored in the main conference and to encourage in-­depth discussion of various technical and application, and community issues in computer vision. We also welcome “Challenge Workshops” that aim to compare new and established methods on common data sets. Workshop registration, venue, as well as proceedings will be handled as part of the main conference by the ACCV organizers.   
 The selection process for workshop space, time and topic coverage will be competitive. We will consider topic coverage, the proposers’ credentials, the interested audience, and relevance of the topic in the selection process. Please note that proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify aspects of their proposals, or merge their proposal with other ones.   
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format (max 4 pages without references, single-column, not less than 10.5 font size) by email to the workshop chairs (  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   ) by  May 31, 2024 (23:59 AoE time)   . The candidate workshop organizers will be notified of the decision by June 30, 2024.  When preparing a proposal, please note that ACCV regular paper acceptance notification is on September 20, 2024.    
 The proposals should include the following information:   
 1. TECHNICAL INFORMATION   
 Workshop title 
  Topics that will be covered, with descriptions of why they are relevant. 
  Description of how this proposal relates to the workshops at previous ACCV and CVPR/ICCV/ECCV etc. (be as specific as possible). 
   
 2. ORGANIZERS AND SPEAKERS   
 Organizers’ names, titles and affiliations, with one, potentially two, contact emails of reliably responsive organizers. 
  Background and experience that makes the proposers well-suited for organizing the workshop, including brief biographies. 
  In case this event is part of a workshop series, please provide URLs to the web pages of relevant past events and/or any other relevant information. 
  List of invited speakers. Please list only speakers that confirmed or tentatively confirmed their attendance. For each speaker, please indicate if confirmation is tentative or final. 
  3. LOGISTICS   
 Preference for half-day or full-day event (Note that your workshop may be accepted as a half-day event due to space limitation regardless of your request in proposal.) 
  Tentative program committee. 
  Please indicate one of the following options describing the nature of your event: | Workshop is primarily an invited speaker event 
  Workshop is primarily a peer-reviewed paper event (orals/posters) 
  Workshop will have a roughly even split between invited speakers and peer-reviewed papers 
  Please also indicate if you plan to run a competition with your workshop. 
  If relevant, please provide a paper review timeline. 
  If the workshop includes peer-reviewed papers, will these papers be published in proceedings? (If the answer is yes, you may need to follow the publication schedule of the main conference.) 
  If posters are considered, how many are expected? Note that the conference may limit the number of posters based on available space. 
  Special space or equipment requests, if any. 
  4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   
 After acceptance, workshops will be required to prepare their own websites, separate from the ACCV 2024 webpage. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions and, once finalized, the workshop program. 
  Accepted workshops must provide their program material using a conference Google sheet for producing program/app information. 
  Since ACML 2024 and ACCV 2024 are co-located, please confirm whether you’d be okay if this workshop is shared between the two conferences (Note that workshop chairs will make the final decision on this, based on the overall conference logistics). 
  Additional Contact Information:  
 Note that all workshops are to be in-person. For any questions, please contact the workshop chairs via email at:  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   .

 Workshop QIAW02 — New trends at the intersection of quantum information theory, quantum groups and operator algebras   
   
 02 Dec 2024 - 06 Dec 2024 • Cambridge , United Kingdom   

 Organizer:   
   
 Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences   

 Abstract:   
   
 Over the past few years, several remarkable links between quantum information, quantum groups, and operator algebras have been discovered. This includes in particular the study of non-local games, quantum automorphism groups, and the resolution of Connes’ Embedding problem announced by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen in 2020. The focus of this workshop is the state of the art in this highly active area, covering the latest developments and potential future directions.

 Companion forms for GSp4   
   
 09 Dec 2024 - 20 Dec 2024 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 We believe that the role played by CM forms in Coleman’s conjecture should be replaced by Yoshida lifts in the setting of Siegel cuspidal Hecke eigenforms of genus 2. In particular, the purpose of our project is to show that the Yoshida lifts lie in the image of a certain theta operator. Although companion forms and theta operators of in this setting of Siegel modular forms have studied in characteristic p by numerous authors, the characteristic 0 story remains unexplored.

 CIRM-IHP PROGRAM RESEARCH SCHOOL — Methods in representation theory and operator algebras   
   
 06 Jan 2025 - 10 Jan 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 The research school is an introductory meeting to the thematic program “Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry” to be held at IHP from January to March 2025. The trimester is part of an ongoing effort to bridge two fiels of Mathematics : the representation theory of locally compact groups and the theory of operator algebras. These research domains share origins in harmonic analysis, spectral theory and quantum mechanics but grew in separate directions. Recent progress in representation theory, involving especially non-Riemannian symmetric spaces and spherical varieties, and new tools developed in operator algebras, especially those involving K-theory and the other methods of non-commutative geometry, offer exciting prospects for new work at the interface between the two fields.

 Introductory Workshop EHTW01 — Equivariant homotopy theory in context   
   
 13 Jan 2025 - 17 Jan 2025 • Cambridge , United Kingdom   

 Organizer:   
   
 Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences   

 Topics:   
   
 Equivariant techniques have played a critical role in the proofs of several major results and developments in algebraic topology over the past decade. Examples include the solution of the famous Kervaire invariant one problem, computations of previously inaccessible homotopy groups of spheres based on the motivic Adams spectral sequence, and the new equivariant approach to THH, TC, and algebraic K- theory. The programme will unite experts and young researchers who apply homotopic methods in algebra (operads), algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry (motivic homotopy theory) around the common theme of equivariant methods. Though these methods have already led to significant breakthroughs, their potential is clearly far from exhausted. We foresee that this programme will incite further developments and greater synergies between equivariant homotopy theory and the themes of the programme centred around three workshops: "Operads and calculus", "Chromatic and motivic homotopy theory" and "THH, TC and algebraic K- theory".

 RESEARCH SCHOOL — Arithmetic, Algebraic and Analytics Dynamics   
   
 20 Jan 2025 - 24 Jan 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 The main goal of these Etats de la recherche is to review some of the most recent spectacular developments in algebraic, analytic and arithmetic dynamics. Covered themes will include a variety of problems related to the iteration of rational maps on algebraic varieties as well as the study of their dynamical moduli spaces. Depending on the structure of the ambient field over which these maps are defined, methods may vary drastically. Over the field of complex numbers, one speaks of holomorphic dynamics in which quasi-conformal deformations play a key role. The case of maps defined over general metrized fields have led to the developments of dynamics over Berkovich spaces. One can also consider maps over number fields whose study lies at the core of arithmetic dynamics. Interactions between these various fields have deepened in the recent years. Complex pluripotential theory combined with tools from arithmetic geometry has been used to prove equidistribution results with applications to problems of unlikely intersection, and to explore dynamical moduli spaces and their special varieties. Methods in p-adic analysis and from the minimal model program have revolutionized our understanding of groups of birational transformations. Non-archimedean dynamics has been turned into a very efficient tool to analyze degeneration problems in holomorphic dynamics.

 THEMATIC MONTH — Singularities, differential equations, transcendence   
   
 27 Jan 2025 - 28 Feb 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 This Thematic Month aims to cover topics related to singularity theory of algebraic or analytic spaces, algebraic study of differential equations, and their applications to questions of transcendence. This 5-week program covers different themes that are often not closely related. One of the main objectives is to make them interact. To encourage participants (especially the youngest ones) to attend the entire month and foster interactions outside each one’s expertise zone, the scientific program of each week of the month will consist of courses accessible to non-experts, as well as more specialized presentations.

 Organizer:   
   
 Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics (IPAM)   

 Abstract:   
   
 Over the last half a century, Algebra, Combinatorics, and Discrete Geometry have undergone transformations due, in part, to the connections each of these areas have to other fields and the growth of computational approaches used in the study of theoretical mathematics. These areas are closely intertwined, with various algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric objects playing pivotal roles. These objects include monomial ideals, affine semigroup rings, Stanley-Reisner rings, Ehrhart rings, toric rings, Cox Rings, Chow Rings, Gröbner bases on the algebraic side; graphs, matroids, simplicial complexes, polytopes and polyhedral complexes, convex bodies, posets, lattices, arrangements of hyperplanes on the combinatorial and discrete geometry side.

 RESEARCH IN RESIDENCE — Unsolvable problems in dynamical systems   
   
 24 Feb 2025 - 08 Mar 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 Starting in the 2011 Annals of Mathematics paper of Foreman, Rudolph and Weiss there have many results showing that classical problems in dynamical systems are unsolvable using inherently countable resources. The initial results were for abstract measure preserving systems, but more recent work has focussed on smooth systems on compact manifolds. Gerber and Kunde have made very significant contributions for smooth transformations that are weakly mixing and for Kautomorphisms. They also showed that the Kakutani equivalence relation is not Borel. These results raise more questions than they solve! The proposed Research inResidence is to bring the four researchers together to share knowledge and techniques and hopefully make progress on the open problems.

 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 K-stability is a central topic in modern complex geometry. It characterises Fano manifolds that admit a Kähler-Einstein metric and provides a good notion of compact moduli space for Fano varieties. The winter school will bring together experts on K-stability who will give 8 mini-courses for PhD students and young researchers with a special focus on explicit problems in dimensions two and three. Along with lecture courses, there will be exercise sessions.

 RESEARCH IN RESIDENCE 1 — K-stability   
   
 10 Mar 2025 - 21 Mar 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 We plan to work on several explicit problems about K-stability of smooth and singular Fano threefolds described in the proposal together with Hamid Abban (Nottingham, England) and Kento Fujita (Osaka, Japan). Hamid Abban works on K-stability of Fano varieites, and birational geometry of Fano varieties. His recent results on K-stability crucially changed the subject over the last two years. Kento Fujita is an expert in the general theory of K-stability of Fano varieties. One of the most important works of Fujita consisted on finding and proving a valuative criterion for K-stability.

 CIRM-IHP PROGRAM RESEARCH SCHOOL — Geometric structures and discrete group actions

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 During the past decades, Teichmüller–Thurston theory and its connections to geometrization of 3-manifolds have been used as a model to understand discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie groups and their associated locally homogeneous manifolds. This lead to spectacular developments in which the notion of Anosov group (a subtle higher rank generalization of convex-cocompactness) plays a central role. This school, aimed primarily at PhD students and young postdocs, will present the fundamental results on which these recent developments build, including both geometric, dynamical and analytic aspects of discrete subgroups of Lie groups.

 Frieze patterns in algebra, combinatorics and geometry   
   
 12 May 2025 - 16 May 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 Friezes, introduced 50 years ago by Coxeter, are patterns of integers defined by a simple, local condition. They consist of a finite (or infinite) number of rows written in a lattice, starting with a row of 0s and a row of 1s and satisfying a local SL2-rule: for any four neighbours a, b, c, d forming a diamond we require ad − bc = 1. Since the discovery of links to cluster algebras of type A, a plethora of generalisations have been studied in the last decades. With this workshop, we will provide a platform to establish new links between friezes and research areas in geometry, algebra and combinatorics.

 The Yang-Baxter Equations and All That   
   
 15 Jun 2025 - 21 Jun 2025 • Będlewo, Poland   

 Organizer:   
   
 Banach Center   

 Abstract:   
   
 The conference will explore the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE), a central topic in pure mathematics with connections to particle physics, statistical mechanics, and various mathematical fields like algebra, knot theory, tensor categories, and Hopf–Galois theory. Introduced in the 1960s by Yang and Baxter, the YBE has evolved into a rich and profound area of study. Drinfel'd's combinatorial version of the YBE, proposed in 1992, unveiled deep connections to numerous mathematical structures, including skew polynomial algebras, Bieberbach and Garside groups, and self-distributive structures such as racks and quandles. New algebraic concepts such as cycle sets, braces, and trusses were developed to address YBE-related problems and have found applications in other areas of mathematics.

 CIMPA School on Automorphic L-functions   
   
 30 Jun 2025 - 11 Jul 2025 • IIT Ropar, India   

 Organizer:   
   
 Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (CIMPA)   

 Abstract:   
   
 An L-function is a function defined additively by a Dirichlet series with a multiplicative Euler product. The initial work of Dirichlet was generalized to number fields by Hecke and given an adelic interpretation by Tate which paved the way to move from GL(1) to higher degree L functions associated to automorphic forms of GL(n) for a general n . Automorphic L functions are essentially analytic objects and allow translations between arithmetic and analysis. We recall the legendary correspondence in the case of the Riemann-ζ function, the prototype of higher L -functions both analytic and arithmetic-algebraic, between an arithmetic statement on the distribution of primes and an analytic one on the distribution of its zeros. Now there are many more parameters to explore. For example, bounding twisted automorphic forms in terms of conductors help obtain the asymptotics of representations of totally positive integers by ternary quadratic forms. The aim of this school is to prepare the participants to appreciate the contemporary theory of automorphic representations, their L -functions and their surprising links with diverse fields like Fourier analysis, algebraic geometry and theoretical physics.

 Focus Program on Algebraic Topology In memory of Fred Cohen   
   
 02 Jul 2025 - 01 Aug 2025 • Toronto, Ontario, Canada   

 Organizer:   
   
 The Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences   

 Abstract:   
   
 Homotopy theory is in the midst of a renaissance as its usefulness in other areas of mathematics is becoming increasingly recognised. From polyhedral products in geometric group theory, to combinatorial methods in group theory, to topological properties of manifolds and spaces of embeddings, to Morava K-theory in symplectic geometry, to simplicial methods in topological data analysis, to a host of applications in mathematical physics - and these name only a few areas of interaction - homotopy theory over the past ten to fifteen years has significantly extended its reach. This program will assemble a wide range of leading experts to discuss the state of the art in current research, both in terms of core fundamental problems and crossover to other areas, and explore exciting new directions.

 Frontiers of Lie Theory: Computational Aspacts and Applications   
   
 28 Sep 2025 - 04 Oct 2025 • Będlewo, Poland   

 Organizer:   
   
 Banach Center   

 Abstract:   
   
 Since its origins in the work of Sophus Lie (now more than a century ago), Lie theory has seen tremendous developments and is now fundamental in many areas of mathematics (like group theory, geometry, symmetric spaces etc) and physics (quantum mechanics, particle physics, theory of gravity). Nowadays there are specialized computer packages such as LiE, the Atlas project, the package Chevie for GAP3, the program ChevLie. Also the more general purpose computer algebra systems GAP4, MAGMA and SageMath have large libraries for dealing with various objects that are central to Lie theory.

 Dagstuhl-Seminar — Solving Problems on Graphs: From Structure to Algorithms   
   
 19 Jan 2025 - 24 Jan 2025 • Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, Germany   

 Organizer:   
   
 Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik   

 Abstract:   
   
 Many discrete optimization problems can be modelled as graph problems, leading to a long list of well-studied problems, which include graph partitioning, covering and packing problems, network design problems, width parameter problems, and so on. Most of these graph problems are computationally hard. However, this situation may change if we require the input to belong to some special graph class. This leads to two fundamental questions, which lie at the heart of our Dagstuhl Seminar: for which classes of graphs can a computationally hard graph problem be solved in polynomial time, and for which classes of graphs does the problem remain hard? In our seminar, we aim to discover new insights that lead to results for a whole range of problems rather than just for a single problem alone.

 Random ergodic optimization   
   
 30 Jun 2025 - 11 Jul 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 Ergodic optimization is a general framework in dynamical system where an observable is understood through its minimum over the set of invariant probability measures. A measure that attained that minimum is called minimizing. The general question is to understand the set of minimizing measures and more generally the set of minimizing orbits. One possible approach is to see minimizing measures as ground states, that is as limits of Gibbs measures at zero temperature. Gibbs measures are eigensolutions of the Ruelle operator or the transfer operator. We intend to study such questions in the framework of skew products of dynamical systems where the base dynamics is random (ergodic and invertible) and the fiber dynamics is a composition of maps indexed by a random environment. The problem of optimizing an observable in a random environment is new and has not yet been studied.

 Call For Workshop Proposals  
 Workshop Chairs:   
 Vineeth Balasubramanian (IIT-Hyderabad)   
 Anh Tran (VinAI Research)   
 Proposal Deadline:  June 9, 2024    
   Notification by:  June 30, 2024   
 Email  : accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com    
 We are soliciting proposals for in-person workshops to be held together with the 17th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Workshops — co-located with ACML 2024 – will take place on the 8th and 9th of December, 2024.   
 The purpose of workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on emerging topics that will not be fully explored in the main conference and to encourage in-­depth discussion of various technical and application, and community issues in computer vision. We also welcome “Challenge Workshops” that aim to compare new and established methods on common data sets. Workshop registration, venue, as well as proceedings will be handled as part of the main conference by the ACCV organizers.   
 The selection process for workshop space, time and topic coverage will be competitive. We will consider topic coverage, the proposers’ credentials, the interested audience, and relevance of the topic in the selection process. Please note that proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify aspects of their proposals, or merge their proposal with other ones.   
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format (max 4 pages without references, single-column, not less than 10.5 font size) by email to the workshop chairs (  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   ) by  May 31, 2024 (23:59 AoE time)   . The candidate workshop organizers will be notified of the decision by June 30, 2024.  When preparing a proposal, please note that ACCV regular paper acceptance notification is on September 20, 2024.    
 The proposals should include the following information:   
 1. TECHNICAL INFORMATION   
 Workshop title 
  Topics that will be covered, with descriptions of why they are relevant. 
  Description of how this proposal relates to the workshops at previous ACCV and CVPR/ICCV/ECCV etc. (be as specific as possible). 
   
 2. ORGANIZERS AND SPEAKERS   
 Organizers’ names, titles and affiliations, with one, potentially two, contact emails of reliably responsive organizers. 
  Background and experience that makes the proposers well-suited for organizing the workshop, including brief biographies. 
  In case this event is part of a workshop series, please provide URLs to the web pages of relevant past events and/or any other relevant information. 
  List of invited speakers. Please list only speakers that confirmed or tentatively confirmed their attendance. For each speaker, please indicate if confirmation is tentative or final. 
  3. LOGISTICS   
 Preference for half-day or full-day event (Note that your workshop may be accepted as a half-day event due to space limitation regardless of your request in proposal.) 
  Tentative program committee. 
  Please indicate one of the following options describing the nature of your event: | Workshop is primarily an invited speaker event 
  Workshop is primarily a peer-reviewed paper event (orals/posters) 
  Workshop will have a roughly even split between invited speakers and peer-reviewed papers 
  Please also indicate if you plan to run a competition with your workshop. 
  If relevant, please provide a paper review timeline. 
  If the workshop includes peer-reviewed papers, will these papers be published in proceedings? (If the answer is yes, you may need to follow the publication schedule of the main conference.) 
  If posters are considered, how many are expected? Note that the conference may limit the number of posters based on available space. 
  Special space or equipment requests, if any. 
  4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   
 After acceptance, workshops will be required to prepare their own websites, separate from the ACCV 2024 webpage. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions and, once finalized, the workshop program. 
  Accepted workshops must provide their program material using a conference Google sheet for producing program/app information. 
  Since ACML 2024 and ACCV 2024 are co-located, please confirm whether you’d be okay if this workshop is shared between the two conferences (Note that workshop chairs will make the final decision on this, based on the overall conference logistics). 
  Additional Contact Information:  
 Note that all workshops are to be in-person. For any questions, please contact the workshop chairs via email at:  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   .

 DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION   

 The ACCV community is strongly committed to addressing issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at our conference. Diversity has many dimensions, including gender, race, ethnicity, age, disabilities, religious belief, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. There is no place for hatred and discrimination in the ACCV community or elsewhere.  
 ACCV 2024 is dedicated to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by increasing student participation from underrepresented communities through registration waivers or reduced registration fees. Decisions are based on various factors, including financial need, contributions to the conference, travel origin, identified communities, and advisor support.  
 Decisions will be made by the Early Bird Registration Deadline (October 28 at 11:59 PM EST)    
 If you have any questions, please contact the DEI Chairs at accv2024_dei@googlegroups.com

 Email  : accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com    
 We are soliciting proposals for in-person workshops to be held together with the 17th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Workshops — co-located with ACML 2024 – will take place on the 8th and 9th of December, 2024.   
 The purpose of workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on emerging topics that will not be fully explored in the main conference and to encourage in-­depth discussion of various technical and application, and community issues in computer vision. We also welcome “Challenge Workshops” that aim to compare new and established methods on common data sets. Workshop registration, venue, as well as proceedings will be handled as part of the main conference by the ACCV organizers.   
 The selection process for workshop space, time and topic coverage will be competitive. We will consider topic coverage, the proposers’ credentials, the interested audience, and relevance of the topic in the selection process. Please note that proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify aspects of their proposals, or merge their proposal with other ones.   
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format (max 4 pages without references, single-column, not less than 10.5 font size) by email to the workshop chairs (  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   ) by  May 31, 2024 (23:59 AoE time)   . The candidate workshop organizers will be notified of the decision by June 30, 2024.  When preparing a proposal, please note that ACCV regular paper acceptance notification is on September 20, 2024.    
 The proposals should include the following information:   
 1. TECHNICAL INFORMATION

  Please also indicate if you plan to run a competition with your workshop. 
  If relevant, please provide a paper review timeline. 
  If the workshop includes peer-reviewed papers, will these papers be published in proceedings? (If the answer is yes, you may need to follow the publication schedule of the main conference.) 
  If posters are considered, how many are expected? Note that the conference may limit the number of posters based on available space. 
  Special space or equipment requests, if any. 
  4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   
 After acceptance, workshops will be required to prepare their own websites, separate from the ACCV 2024 webpage. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions and, once finalized, the workshop program. 
  Accepted workshops must provide their program material using a conference Google sheet for producing program/app information. 
  Since ACML 2024 and ACCV 2024 are co-located, please confirm whether you’d be okay if this workshop is shared between the two conferences (Note that workshop chairs will make the final decision on this, based on the overall conference logistics).

  Presentation Formats  
   Oral Presentation (25 minutes)   
 This is the standard presentation format. In an oral presentation the presenter delivers their research to their audience verbally, often accompanied by a PowerPoint slideshow. Oral presentations are generally organised by stream into parallel sessions comprising three or four presentations.  

   Poster Presentation (60 minutes)   
 A poster presentation provides a relaxed presentation atmosphere in which the presenter uses a poster pinned to a poster board (1800mm high by 900mm wide) to illustrate their research. Presenters will often engage with interested participants on a one-to-one basis, providing excellent opportunities for networking, discussion and relationship building. A Virtual Poster Presentation option is also available as an alternative means for those delegates who may be unable to travel to the conference due to financial or political restrictions.  

   Live-Stream Presentation via Zoom (25 minutes)   
 Many people around the world are moving meetings, classrooms and events online, and IAFOR is now offering the option to present online, via Zoom. This is an exciting new opportunity for scholars around the world to engage with an international audience without the need to travel. Live-stream presentations give speakers the opportunity to avoid expenses and time required to travel, reduce their carbon footprint, and share ideas online. Additionally, many of the same benefits enjoyed by presenters at traditional in-person conferences are also available to online presenters, including presenting one’s work to an international audience and engaging in Q&A, publishing in the Conference Proceedings, and participating in discussions with other scholars around the world.  

   Virtual Presentation (Pre-Recorded Video or Pre-submitted Poster)   
 Two presentation options are available:  
  1) Virtual Video Presentation – Present via a pre-recorded video.  
  2) Virtual Poster Presentation – Submit a poster and optionally present your poster with a 3-minute introductory video.  
 Virtual presentations afford authors the opportunity to present their research to IAFOR’s far-reaching and international online audience, without time restrictions, distractions or the need to travel. Presenters are invited to create a video of their presentation, which is then uploaded to the official IAFOR Vimeo channel  and remains online indefinitely. This is a valuable and impactful way of presenting in its own right, but also an alternative means for those delegates who may be unable to travel to the conference due to financial or political restrictions. The same publishing opportunities apply to virtual presenters, with final papers being included in the Conference Proceedings  .  
 Following the conference virtual presenters will receive a Certificate of Presentation 
  The Vimeo channel will be referenced on all conference materials. 
  There is no limit to length or style but certain restrictions apply to file size and music selection. Guidelines and further information on creating the video will be sent following registration. 
  Please note that video presentations are to be created by the author. 

   Workshop Presentation (50 minutes)   
 A workshop is a brief, intensive course, lasting 50 minutes, which is led by an experienced researcher or practitioner, usually with a PhD-level qualification. It facilitates group interaction and the exchange of information between a smaller number of participants than is usual at a plenary session.  
 Often a workshop involves problem-solving, skills training, or the dissemination of new content or disciplinary approaches. Conference workshops are typically more instructional and interactive in nature than oral presentations and involve participants working with the workshop leader on a particular topical issue.  

   Symposium Presentations (75 minutes)   
 Symposium presentations are conceived and organised by individuals who recruit speakers to present papers on a specific topic. Presenters should submit their own abstracts separately before a Symposium Presentation can be proposed. Presenters may submit separate papers to the Conference Proceedings  . The organiser will require a Submission Number from each accepted presenter in order to propose a Symposium Presentation.  
  They last for 75 minutes and are typically organised as follows:  
 Introduction 
  3 or 4 oral presentations based on submitted abstracts 
  Discussion 

   Panel Presentations (75 minutes)   
 Panel presentations are conceived and organised by individuals who recruit speakers to present in an interactive discussion on a specific topic. There are no titles associated with the panelists’ presentations. Proposals for panel discussions should include clear descriptions of the topics to be discussed. Presenters may submit a joint paper to the Conference Proceedings. They last for 75 minutes and are typically organised as follows:  
 Introduction 
  a short presentation by each panel member 
  Discussion 
  As the organiser of a proposed panel, submit your proposal through the online system  . Presenters may submit a joint paper to the Conference Proceedings  .  

  Review System  
 Authors as Reviewers: A Reciprocal System  
 Our academic events would not be what they are without a commitment to ensuring adherence to international norms of abstract peer review. IAFOR relies on a large number of international scholars from around the world to contribute to a shared vision of promoting and engaging in international, intercultural and interdisciplinary dialogue, and if you are taking part in an IAFOR event, then that would mean you. Authors may be asked to review up to five abstracts for the conference. You are under no obligation to participate in this reciprocal system, but if you are selected to review, and undertake this task of grading abstracts for the conference, you will be credited in the conference programme.  
  Scheduling Requests  
 Because of the complexity of putting the Conference Programme together and the large numbers of participants involved, it is not usually possible to accommodate requests for specific presentation days or times. We ask that you reserve requests for religious reasons or other exceptional and unavoidable circumstances.  
 We encourage participants to attend the conference each day in order to benefit fully from the experience. While requests for specific presentation days or times are not accepted other than under exceptional circumstances, you may request one blackout day – a day on which you will not be scheduled to present at the conference.  
 Scheduling requests will not be accepted after the registration deadline.   
  Conference Proceedings  
 If you wish your paper to be published in the Conference Proceedings, once you have registered please ensure that you upload your full paper through the online system by January 15, 2025  .  
 Final papers are only accepted in Microsoft Word format. Before submitting your paper please ensure that you have read the Final Paper Guidelines  and formatted your paper correctly.  
 The official Conference Proceedings will be published online in a PDF format under an ISSN issued by the National Diet Library of Japan  on February 22, 2025  .  
  Publication & Licensing Issues

 Call for Papers  
   
 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your research for presentation at our 12th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held in Glasgow, UK, September 16-18, 2024.  
 The Conference series on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore (conditional on the approval by IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2024 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing  .  
 The theme for ACII 2024 is Human and Beyond  (e.g., animals, virtual agents, and robots). The goal is to move from interaction settings involving only humans, the most common topic in Affective Computing, to more general scenarios in which multiple types of agents (natural and artificial) share a common social landscape and seamlessly participate in efficient and effective interactions.  
 The conference will be co-located with IVA ( Intelligent Virtual Agent Conference  ), 2024.
