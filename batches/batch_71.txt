 Overview The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected. There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers. Submission Type: Full vs. Short USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper. For further details, see the submission instructions. Deployed Systems Track USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track. Early Rejection Notifications USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent. Authors' Response Period USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above. Confidentiality All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. On the Use of Generative AI While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers including sections generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org. Questions? Please direct any questions to the program co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org or to the USENIX office at submissionspolicy@usenix.org.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-08-13

 Abstract   
   
 The virtual machine abstraction provides a wide variety of benefits which have undeniably enabled cloud computing. Virtual machines, however, are a double-edged sword as hypervisors they run on top of must treat them as a black box, limiting the information which the hypervisor and virtual machine may exchange, a problem known as the semantic gap. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a new mechanism, hyperupcalls, which enables a hypervisor to safely execute verified code provided by a guest virtual machine in order to transfer information. Hyperupcalls are written in C and have complete access to guest data structures such as page tables. We provide a complete framework which makes it easy to access familiar kernel functions from within a hyperupcall. Compared to state-of-the-art paravirtualization techniques and virtual machine introspection, Hyperupcalls are much more flexible and less intrusive. We demonstrate that hyperupcalls can not only be used to improve guest performance for certain operations by up to 2× but hyperupcalls can also serve as a powerful debugging and security tool.

 UMAP 2024  will adopt registration  and presentation policies  that must be followed by the authors of each accepted contribution. We invite prospective authors to carefully check them in the call before submitting. Any inquiries can be directed to umap2024-chair@um.org  .   

 The 32nd International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2024) is the premier international conference for researchers and practitioners working on systems that adapt to individual users or groups of users, and that collect, represent, and model user information. ACM UMAP  2024 is sponsored by ACM SIGCHI  and SIGWEB  . User Modeling Inc.  , as the core Steering Committee, oversees the conference organization. ACM UMAP operates under the ACM Conference Code of Conduct  . The main conference proceedings, published by ACM, will be part of the ACM Digital Library  .  

 The theme of ACM UMAP 2024  is “ Collaboration and Cooperation for the Greater Good   “. Specifically, we welcome submissions that highlight the impact that working together and synergy (such as between academia, industry, influential policy making bodies, committees and communities) can have on solving the world’s biggest problems; the focus is on investigations that capture how user modeling, personalization, and adaptation of (intelligent) systems, also with the use of large language models and generative AI, may influence user behavior, trustful processes and whether new models are required, for building sustainable and inclusive services and solutions that can address critical challenges of our world.  

 While we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only. As always, contributions from academia, industry, and other organizations discussing open challenges or novel research approaches are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to claims (e.g., user study, system evaluation, computational analysis).

 Personalized, computer-generated recommendations have become a pervasive feature of today’s online world. From the traditional book and movie recommendations to suggestions of what we should eat and wear or where we should travel, recommender systems are seamlessly embedded in our daily lives. The underlying recommender systems are designed to help users and providers in a number of ways. From a user’s viewpoint, these systems assist humans by identifying relevant items or options (e.g., products, services, news articles, connections) within large collections. From a provider’s perspective, recommender systems have shown to be powerful tools to help users sift through massive information and steer consumer behavior. Regardless of who are the main stakeholders, the design of recommender systems requires careful consideration of various aspects, including the choice of the user modeling approach, the recommendation algorithm itself, and the user interface.

 The use of graphs recently emerged as a natural and straightforward fashion to effectively model a broad range of phenomena and scenarios, ranging from the relationships in a social network to the elements encoded in a knowledge base, without forgetting their applications related to bioinformatics, web page searching, transportation, and navigation.  

 Research in the area of graphs typically includes: (i) schema design to represent data which will be modeled in the form of a graph; (ii) adding semantics to properties to the schema types and edges to make data meaningful and transform it into information (iii) reasoning over a graph to produce new information hidden behind the data; (iv) exploiting the information encoded in the graph for specific applications and use cases. All these aspects have triggered several heterogeneous research lines, that in turn significantly impacted user modeling, adaptation, and personalization.  

 As an example, the recent rise of knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata has fueled the research in the area of adaptive web and personalized applications (e.g., recommender systems) by providing new and meaningful data points to model and represent all the actors (items, users, etc.) involved in the personalization process.  

 Read More    
 Similarly, graph-based information available in the so-called social web has provided a lot of new ideas to better model the users based on the information they spread on social networks and social media, as well as on the people they have relationships with. Moreover, by modeling the information spread on social media as a graph, it is possible to analyze very complex phenomena (e.g., diffusion of harmful content) with new and effective methods.  
  
 The use of languages and formalisms originally developed for the Semantic Web (e.g., ontologies) can further push all these methods by allowing reasoning and inference over the graphs. Additionally, incorporating neurosymbolic approaches into recommender systems, which combine symbolic reasoning with neural network-based techniques, holds great promise for enhancing the effectiveness of personalization. Finally, the use of graphs is particularly relevant for personalization since recent techniques for learning graph-based representations, ranging from GNNs to graph embedding techniques, obtained competitive performances in a broad set of scenarios and tasks, including state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.  
  
 Accordingly, this track provides a forum for researchers to discuss open research problems, mature solutions, the latest challenges, novel applications, and innovative research approaches investigating the use of knowledge graphs for the social, semantic, and adaptive web. We invite original submissions addressing all aspects of personalization, user model building, and personal experience in online social systems.

 User modeling allows systems to provide personalized support to humans, unlocking a potential to accomplish a wider range of tasks and/or make their existing tasks more efficient and/or convenient. While such systems are envisioned to seamlessly complement human abilities, research shows that humans do not always make the best possible decisions when working together with computer systems. Intelligent user interfaces aim to make the interaction between computer systems and humans smarter, more usable, more efficient, and more effective.  

 Typically, papers in this track explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of personalized/intelligent user-facing systems, interfaces, and interaction mechanisms. By designing and deploying improved forms of support for interactive collaboration between human decision makers and personalized systems, intelligent user interfaces enable decision making processes that better leverage the strengths of both collaborators. Beyond user modeling and personalization, papers in this track are encouraged to leverage solutions from human-computer interaction, data mining, natural language processing, information visualization, and/or knowledge representation and reasoning.

 Technology has become an integral aspect of the everyday practices of learning. Navigating the streams of information, acquiring new skills and competences, and developing knowledge ‘on the go’ in formal education, personal study, workplaces, personal development, and health, are increasingly valued and necessary. In fact, technological innovations bring new opportunities to support learners’ needs, to orchestrate and enable personalized learning solutions, feedback processes, learner-learner collaboration, social learning, and learner-algorithm interaction, with and without the involvement of the teacher. This opens up opportunities for innovation by modeling the cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, affective, social, and psychomotor aspects of learning that can improve the effectiveness of personalized learning experiences for learning progress and learner/teacher satisfaction.

 The impact of the UMAP community on personalizing learner experiences ranges from more formal educational settings to workplace training, apprentice preparation, and continuous personal development. The experiences can happen in traditional domains such as mathematics, science, language, etc., but also extend to less traditional areas such as medicine, industry, sports, active aging, arts, and more. The datafication of these diverse learning experiences offers the UMAP community an opportunity to personalize learning in these, formerly less represented, areas by defining and developing novel user models.  
  
 As personalized learning is interdisciplinary, there are thematic threads related to personalized learning that connect researchers and practitioners from sister communities, which we hope can join the discussion in the UMAP community. For instance, the focus of Educational Data Mining (EDM) on data and feature engineering, as well as algorithmic development, can provide input to learner models. Moreover, long-standing Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) work on augmenting learning with artificial intelligence can deliver personalized interventions to learners. In the same vein, Learning Analytics (LAK) research that ties indicators of learning with feedback processes can further inform learner modeling and adaptation of the learning experience.  
  
 This track invites researchers, developers, and practitioners from various disciplines to present their innovative solutions for modeling the learning experience, share outcomes, and discuss their challenges for effectively providing personalized support to learners in any kind of domain (school, workplace, industry, sports, health, etc.). The track encourages submissions focused on systems (within or without learning environments), including but not limited to intelligent tutoring systems, personal learning environments, sensing devices and ambient intelligent features, MOOCs, serious games, escape rooms, agent-based learning environments, virtual pedagogical agents and chatbots, and personalized immersive spaces, among others, that adapt to individual learners or to groups of learners, and that collect, represent and model learning information, interaction, and feedback processes to offer rewarding personalized learning experiences.  
  
 As the main theme of ACM UMAP 2024 is “Collaboration and Cooperation for the Greater Good”  , we would particularly encourage submissions focusing on modeling collaborative and group learning experiences and the impact of learner collaborations on their cognitive, metacognitive, and behavioral states, among other aspects.  
  
 Topics framing this track include (but are not limited to):  
 Domain, learner, teacher and context modeling 
  Modeling cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, affective, social, and psychomotor aspects of learning 
  Diagnosis of learner needs and calibration of support and feedback 
  Adaptive and personalized support for learning

 Researchers and developers have a social responsibility to care about the impact of their technologies on individual people (users, providers, and other stakeholders) and on society. This involves building, maintaining, evaluating, and studying adaptive systems that are fair, ethical, beneficial to society, and in line with universal human rights. The importance of these topics is highlighted by their presence in ethical guidelines such as the ACM Code of Ethics, policy guidelines such as UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, as well as their influence on law and regulation such as the EU’s GDPR and the proposed AI Act.  

 Following these developments, the track on “Fairness, Transparency, Accountability, and Privacy” seeks contributions dealing with ethical and social matters of adaptive and recommendation systems, such as fairness and privacy, as well as works addressing compliance with policies and regulations, such as requirements for transparency, accountability, and protection of sensitive data. The research trends in Generative AI, e.g. in Large Language Models (LLM), frequently overlook aspects related to Fairness and Trust. The track seeks studies that delve into the transparency, trustworthiness, fairness, and privacy of these systems, and those aimed at developing methods for LLMs to selectively forget certain information to respect the user/stakeholders needs.

 To address various societal problems, changing human behavior is crucial. Persuasive and Behaviour change systems are intentionally designed to support people to achieve behavior change objectives. Research in this area has advanced over the years attracting interest from both practitioners and researchers due to the increasing realization of the important role interactive technologies can play in assisting and motivating people to achieve their various goals and objectives.  

 Persuasive and behavior change systems have applications in various domains including health and wellness, safety and security, environmental sustainability, education, and politics. For their personalization, persuasive and behavior change systems adapt and tailor the presented content or the decision context to increase their relevance, motivational appeal, or to enhance the user experience. The overall aim is to empower or assist people to achieve their goals, by exploiting user models and adapting systems. However, the persuasive use of personalizations on today’s large platforms or digital technologies is causing increasing concerns about behavior engineering that may harm users’ digital wellbeing, privacy or autonomy. Personalized persuasive technology can be used to change user behaviour for unethical and exploitative purposes, for example, to achieve higher monetization in game design. Despite the recent advances, research in this area, where technology and theory should meet, is generally still in its infancy.

 Virtual assistants and conversational agents are being employed to support information search and exploration, as well as to mediate interaction with users. Human-robot interaction is also increasingly attracting attention as a new model to support user activity and empowerment, with particular attention to people with physical impairments, who can benefit from assistance during the execution of tasks. People may also be able to benefit from companionship provided by virtual assistants and robots. In both contexts, personalization is a key element to support the adaptation of an agent to personal interests, idiosyncrasies, and needs.  

 Read More    
 A personalized and adaptive interaction strongly relies on learning a computational model of human behavior, and on its integration into the decision-making algorithms of an agent. This includes also the possibility of endowing the agent with meta-cognition capabilities, such as the capability of reasoning about the partner’s intentions, desires, and beliefs, as well as their internal states, personality, and emotions. The ability of an agent to adapt its behaviour according to social expectations, specific cultural norms, and individual preferences will determine the success and large-scale use of its applications.  
  
 This track aims to investigate new models and techniques for the adaptation of these agents to individual users.

 Submission   

 All submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system, https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap24  , by selecting the “UMAP24 Full and Short Papers” track.  

 Length and Formatting   

 Format  . We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM new single-column format.  

 Long papers | ( | 14 | pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value. They should reflect more complex innovations or studies and should have a more thorough discussion of related work. Each accepted long paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented in a plenary session as part of the main conference program. 
  Short papers | ( | 7 | pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper – they are not “work-in-progress” reports but rather complete reports on a smaller or simpler-to-describe but complete research work on advances that can be described, set into context, and evaluated concisely. In particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance to this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental validation or lacking strong theoretical foundation. Each accepted short paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented either as an oral presentation or at a poster session as part of the main conference program. 

 We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.  

 Anonymity  . Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ own prior work should be made in the third person. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection.  

 Templates  . Following the ACM Publication Workflow  , all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the new ACM single-column format  . Instructions for authors are given below:  

 LaTeX | (use \documentclass[manuscript, review, anonymous]{acmart} in the sample-authordraft.tex file for single-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | preparing your article with LaTeX | .

  Word | . Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | preparing your article with Microsoft Word 

 Should you have any questions or issues going through the instructions above, please contact support at acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com for LaTeX and Microsoft Word inquiries.  

 Accessibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. The descriptive text will be displayed in place of a float if the float cannot be loaded. This benefits the author and it broadens the reader base for the author’s work. Moreover, the alt text provides in-depth float descriptions to search engine crawlers, which helps to properly index these floats. Additionally, authors should follow the ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures  .  

 Submission Policy  . All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy  , which is why submitted manuscripts should not be currently under review at another publication venue. Particularly, please consider the following ACM’s publication policies:  

 “By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all | ACM Publications Policies | , including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.” 
  “Please ensure that you and your co-authors | obtain an ORCID ID | , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a | commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors | . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.” 

 Content Expectations   

 Originality and Significance  . Papers should report on original and substantial contributions of lasting value. Described work should concern the theory and/or practice of UMAP. Moreover, papers showcasing the innovative use of UMAP and exploring the benefits and challenges of applying UMAP technology in real-life applications and contexts are welcome.  

 Commisurated evaluation  . Evaluations of proposed solutions/applications must be commensurate with the claims made in the paper. Depending on the intended contribution, this may include simulation studies, offline evaluations, A/B tests, or controlled user experiments.  

 Reproducibility  . Research procedures and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure scrutiny and reproducibility. We recognize that user data may be proprietary or confidential, but we encourage the sharing of (anonymized, cleaned) data sets, data collection procedures, and code.  

 Discussion and Implications  . Results should be clearly communicated and implications of the contributions/findings for UMAP and beyond should be explicitly discussed.  

 Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations   

 ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.  

 Review Process & Camera-ready Submission   

 Review  . ACM UMAP uses a double-blind  review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ prior work should be in the third person. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.  

 Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field. Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on whether the length is appropriate for the contribution. In addition, ACM UMAP 2024  will introduce a new “Raise Your Voice” stage during evaluation, offering a small window to authors to optionally discuss the initial decision of their submission, enhancing the transparency and quality of the reviewing process.  

 The ACM Code of Ethics  gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Further, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection.  

 Camera-ready Information  . Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting  . Users of the Word template must use either the version for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats such as Open Office, etc., are not admitted) for the camera-ready submission to avoid incompatibility issues.  

 Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided after acceptance. This might include instructions to prepare a video of the accepted contribution. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be later submitted using ACM’s new production platform  where authors will be able to review PDF and HTML output formats before publication.  

 Registration and Presentation Policy   

 Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration  , completed by the early registration date cut-off  . Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM  and available via the ACM Digital Library  . The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of UMAP 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

 USENIX Security '25 Submission Policies and Instructions  

 USENIX Security '25 submissions deadlines are as follows:  
 Cycle 1 Deadline: | Wednesday, September 4, 2024, 11:59 pm AoE 
  Cycle 2 Deadline: | Wednesday, January 22, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE 
  All papers that are accepted by the end of the second submission cycle (January–June 2025) will appear in the proceedings for USENIX Security '25. All submissions should be made online via their respective submission systems: Cycle 1  and Cycle 2 (available soon) . We do not accept email submissions.  
 Submitted papers should describe original, scientifically sound work produced by the co-authors. All submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Submissions should be finished, complete papers. We may desk-reject papers that have severe editorial problems (broken references, egregious spelling or grammar errors, missing figures, etc.), are submitted in violation of the Submission Instructions outlined below, are outside of the scope of the symposium, or are deemed clearly of insufficient quality to appear in the program.  
 Summary of main changes from previous editions   
   
 Ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy must be discussed in the paper. An extra page is provided just for these topics. Artifacts are expected to be available by the camera-ready deadline. 
   
 Paper Format  
 Submissions must be in PDF format. Please make sure your submission can be opened using Adobe Reader. Please make sure your submission, and all embedded figures, are intelligible when printed in grayscale.  
 Submissions should be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two-column format in 10-point Times Roman type on 12-point leading (single-spaced), in a text block 7" x 9" deep. Authors must use USENIX's templates and style files  when preparing the paper for submission. Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection.  
 Initial paper submissions (i.e., all papers except those that have been revised after receiving an "Invited for Major Revision" decision at USENIX Security '25 or "Accept Conditional on Major Revision" at USENIX Security '24) should consist of at most 13 typeset pages for the main body of the paper, one additional page for discussing ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy, and a bibliography and well-marked appendices. At submission time, there is no limit on the length of the bibliography and appendices but reviewers are not required to read any appendices. These appendices may be included to assist reviewers who may have questions that fall outside the stated contribution of the paper on which your work is to be evaluated, or to provide details that would only be of interest to a small minority of readers. The paper should be self-contained without appendices.  
 To accommodate additional material requested by reviewers, the revisions for papers that previously received an "Accept Conditional on Major Revision" decision can use up to 14 typeset pages for the main body of the paper, excluding the one page for discussing ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy, the bibliography, and well-marked appendices.  
 Once accepted, the final version should be no longer than 20 pages, including the bibliography and any appendices.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 The review process will be anonymous. Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review:  
 The title page should not contain any author names or affiliations. 
  Authors should carefully review figures and appendices (especially survey instruments) to ensure affiliations are not accidentally included. 
  When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Anonymous references are only allowed in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible, and after approval of the chairs. 
  Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. Neither the link in the paper nor the website itself should suggest the authors' identities (e.g., the website should not contain the authors' names or affiliations). 
  Authors should carefully check any submitted prior reviews for identifying details. 
  Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc., during the review process.  
 Simultaneous Submission and Plagiarism  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. Authors should relate their submission to any other relevant submissions of theirs in other venues that are under review at the same time as their submission to the Symposium. These citations to simultaneously submitted papers should be anonymized; non-anonymous versions of these citations must, however, be emailed to the program co-chairs at sec25chairs@usenix.org  . Failure to point out and explain overlap with published or simultaneously submitted papers will be grounds for rejection. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy  for details.  
 Papers that have received a decision of "Invited for Major Revision" from USENIX Security are still considered to be under review until accepted or rejected by the reviewers; authors must formally withdraw their paper if they wish to submit to another venue. See USENIX Security '25 Reviewing Model  for details. Submissions that were rejected from the last cycle of USENIX Security '24 may not be resubmitted until the second cycle of USENIX Security '25.  
 All submitted papers are considered to be under review for USENIX Security '25 until authors are notified of a decision by the program committee or the program co-chairs approve a request for withdrawal.  
 Ethics  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of all  submissions. All submissions are hence required to have an ethics considerations section in the main body of the paper, or in the extra page offered for "ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy" (see the Paper Format section above), or both. In some cases, the ethics discussion may be short; in other cases, the ethics consideration may be long. Regardless of length, from reading the main body of the paper and the extra "ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy" page, it should be clear to reviewers that the authors made sound and responsible ethical decisions.  
 Authors should be prepared to answer these questions in the conference submission portal:  
 "I attest that I read the ethics considerations discussions in the conference call for papers, the detailed submissions instructions, and the guidelines for ethics document." 
  "I attest that the research team considered the ethics of this research, that the authors believe the research was done ethically, and that the team's next-step plans (e.g., after publication) are ethical." 
  "I attest that the submission has a clearly-marked section on ethical considerations in the body of the paper and/or in the extra 'ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy' page." 
  In addition to reading this page, authors are expected to read the Call for Papers  and the Ethics Guidelines  .  
   
 Open Science Policy  
 Non-compliance with the new open science policy can lead to severe repercussions, including the rejection of the non-compliant paper or, in the case of egregious violations such as not following through with promised artifact sharing, barring the authors from submitting to future conference cycles.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to and rejected from a conference (including USENIX Security), authors may, but are not required to, submit a separate PDF document containing the prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 Reviewers will submit their initial reviews prior to becoming aware of previous reviews and summaries of changes to avoid being biased in formulating their own opinions; once their initial reviews are submitted, however, reviewers will be given the opportunity to update their thoughts based on the submission history of the paper.  
 Rules for Revisions  
 For submissions that received "Invited for Major Revision" decisions during one of the USENIX Security '25 submission periods, authors who revise their papers must submit a separate PDF document that includes the verbatim revision criteria, a list of changes made to the paper, an explanation of how the changes address the criteria, and a copy of the revised paper in which the changes from the original version are highlighted. Ideally, the highlighted version of the paper would be produced by latexdiff or a similar tool. However, if papers have gone through major changes that would make such a document unreadable, authors are free to provide another format that helps the shepherd to identify changes efficiently.  
 Papers that have received a decision of "Invited for Major Revision" from USENIX Security are still considered to be under review until accepted or rejected by the reviewers; authors must formally withdraw their paper if they wish to submit to another venue.  
 For resubmissions of "Major Revisions" from USENIX Security '24, please look at USENIX Security '24 Submission Policies and Instructions  for requirements. Authors are encouraged but not required to adhere to the USENIX Security '25 guidelines for discussing ethics considerations and compliance with open science guidelines.  
 Embargo Requests  
 Authors may request an embargo for their papers by the deadline dates listed below. All embargoed papers will be released on the first day of the conference, Wednesday, August 13, 2025.  
 Cycle 1 deadline for embargo requests: | Thursday, February 27, 2025 
  Cycle 2 deadline for embargo requests: | Thursday, July 10, 2025 
  If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  after you submit your final paper.  
  Conflicts of Interest  
 The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest. This includes: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including secondary affiliations and consulting work), (2) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past, (3) anyone the author has collaborated or published with in the prior two years, (4) anyone who is affiliated with a party that funds your research, or (5) close personal relationships. For other forms of conflict, authors must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. In addition to selecting program committee conflicts when submitting, we recommend that all authors ensure they have up-to-date HotCRP profiles listing all known conflicts.  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from the evaluation and discussion of the paper.  
 Final versions of accepted submissions should include all sources of funding in an acknowledgments section. Authors should also disclose any affiliations, interests, or other facts that might be relevant to readers seeking to interpret the work and its implications. Authors may wish to consider the 2023 IEEE S&P Financial Conflicts Policy  for example.  
 To prevent retroactive conflicts of interest, all authors must be declared at submission time.  
 Confidentiality of Submissions  
 The program committee and external reviewers are required to treat all submissions as confidential. However, the program co-chairs or designated committee members may share submissions outside the program committee to allow chairs of other conferences to identify dual submissions.  
 Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.  
 Reasons for Desk Rejection  
 Papers should not attempt to "squeeze space" by exploiting underspecified formatting criteria (e.g., columns) or through manipulating other document properties (e.g., page layout, spacing, fonts, figures and tables, headings). Papers that, in the chair's assessment, make use of these techniques to receive an unfair advantage, will be rejected, even if they comply with the above specifications. We offer several examples  of observed techniques that have or could lead to rejection. Authors should seek to meet page limits through the modification of content alone. Any other techniques (whether appearing in these examples or not) may result in rejection.  
 Please make sure your paper successfully returns from the PDF checker (visible upon PDF submission) and that document properties, such as font size and margins, can be verified via PDF editing tools such as Adobe Acrobat. Papers where the chairs can not verify compliance with the CFP will be rejected.  
 During the paper submission, the authors need to select among the available topics the ones that are more appropriate for their work. A failure to select topics or a clear attempt at selecting inappropriate or misleading entries may be grounds for administrative rejection.  
 Internet Defense Prize  
 The Internet Defense Prize recognizes and rewards research that meaningfully makes the internet more secure. Created in 2014, the award is funded by Meta and offered in partnership with USENIX to celebrate contributions to the protection and defense of the internet. Successful recipients of the Internet Defense Prize will provide a working prototype that demonstrates significant contributions to the security of the internet, particularly in the areas of prevention and defense. This award is meant to recognize the direction of the research and not necessarily its progress to date. The intent of the award is to inspire researchers to focus on high-impact areas of research. The USENIX Security Awards Committee—selected by the Program Chairs among the symposium Program Committee members—independently determines the prize, to be distributed by USENIX.  
 You may submit your USENIX Security '25 paper submission for consideration for the Prize as part of the regular submission process.  
 Contact Information  
 Specific questions about submissions may be sent to the program co-chairs at sec25chairs@usenix.org  . The chairs will respond to individual questions about the submission process if contacted at least a week before the submission deadline.  
 Further questions? Contact your program co-chairs, sec25chairs@usenix.org  , or the USENIX office, submissionspolicy@usenix.org  .

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

 Some fundamental experiments in subband coding of images  Sven Ole Aase  ,  Tor A. Ramstad     
 Show abstract   
 The paper describes some basic experiments for analyzing the origin and character of the noise in subband coders. A new tool introduced in this paper is an ideal filterbank which guarantees that no interband noise contamination will occur. The coding results are compared with a subband coder based on a standard FIR filterbank. It is found that interband contamination does not play any significant role in the subjectively perceived noise in an image subband coder. Further experiments show that the noise in the decoded image, which subjectively manifests itself as ringing noise in smooth areas close to higher activity regions, is due to the thresholding to zero of a large number of small amplitude subband samples, which takes place in the quantization procedure. It can be thoroughly removed by the dithering technique. The article presents some image material demonstrating the cited results.

 Acquisition of very high resolution images using stereo cameras  Kiyoharu Aizawa  ,  Takashi Komatsu  ,  Takahiro Saito     
 Show abstract   
 The method of image acquisition is one of the principal problems for handling very high resolution images. This paper presents a new scheme for acquiring high resolution pictures by processing stereo images. The method integrates low resolution images into a high resolution image. Analysis of the achievable passband is given from a point of view of the imager photodetector structure. Compared to an imaging device with equivalent resolution, it may be less sensitive to shot noise which becomes more dominant as the pixel size of an imager is further reduced. Preliminary experiments have shown clear improvements in the high frequencies and image details. In addition, a scheme for further increasing tlie resolution is mentioned.   

 Visual factors and image analysis in the encoding of high-quality still images  V. Ralph Algazi  ,  Todd Randall Reed  ,  Gary E. Ford  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 In the encoding of high quality images beyond current standards, a reexamination of issues in the representation, processing and encoding problems is needed. The fundamental reason for that change of emphasis is because the image representation, sampling density, color and motion parameters are no longer given by accepted practices or standards and, thus, require study. Some basic issues that should be reconsidered are as follows:

 Multiresponse imaging system design for improved resolution  Rachel Alter-Gartenberg  ,  Carl L. Fales  ,  Friedrich O. Huck  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 Multiresponse imaging is a process that acquires A images, each with a different optical response, and reassembles them into a single image with an improved resolution that can approach \/y/A times the photodetector-array sampling lattice. Our goals are to optimize the performance of this process in terms of the resolution and fidelity of the restored image and to assess the amount of information required to do so. The theoretical approach is based on the extension of both image- restoration and rate-distortion theories from their traditional realm of signal processing to image processing which includes image gathering and display.   

 Comparison of directionally based and nondirectionally based subband image coders  Roberto H. Bamberger  ,  Mark J. T. Smith     
 Show abstract   
 Many different types of analysis/synthesis decompositions have been investigated for image coding. Some, like those used in traditional transform, pyramid, and subband coders, partition the spatial-frequency spectrum into symmetric bands, i.e., the bands occupy a disjoint region in each of the four frequency plane quadrants [1, 2, 3, 4]. Others have examined related systems that use directionally-based decompositions [5, 6, 7, 8] in which diagonally oriented spatial frequency components are coded. However, the directional resolution in these schemes is often very limited. In this paper, some new exactly reconstructing subband decompositions are presented with directional selectivity. They are examined in the context of subband image coding and compared to directionally invariant subband decompositions in terms of subjective quality.

 Use of a human visual model in subband coding of color video signal with adaptive chrominance signal vector quantization  Dominique Barba  ,  Jose Hanen     
 Show abstract   
 This paper deals with vector quantization of sub-band video color images with a high visual quality. If lots of papers have already been published about the use of both techniques for monochrome still images, few of them work with color images. Our work concerns the use of some important human visual system properties to derive an optimized vector quantization of sub-band decomposed TV images. Two major properties are used. First, spatial frequency dependence in the fovea filtering is pushed into a distortion measure for vector quantization. Secondly, and perhaps the most important is that the codebook design is performed in the splitting algorithm by incorporating two complementary thresholds in the global evaluation of the distortion for each class of the code book : a visibility threshold and an annoyance threshold. With these techniques we designed optimized codebooks (with or without classification) which allowed visual vector quantizing of the chrominance component of color video digital signal without any visible impairment and with a high compression ratio.

 Motion-compensated subsampling of HDTV  Ricardo A. F. Belfor  ,  Reginald L. Lagendijk  ,  Jan Biemond     
 Show abstract   
 For an economical introduction of HDTV a substantial datareduction is necessary, while maintaining the high image quality. To this end Sub-Nyquist techniques can be used (MUSE, HD-MAC) for stationary parts of the image, spreading the sampling of one complete frame over several frames and combining these different frames at the receiver. Without special precautions Sub-Nyquist sampling is not possible for moving areas of the image, in this paper a new algorithm will be described for the subsampling of moving parts of a video sequence. The advantage of this new method is that the full spatial resolution can be preserved, while also maintaining the full temporal resolution. To prevent aliasing at certain velocities ( critical velocities ), the image is divided into a high-pass and a low-pass part prior to subsampling. At the receiver a motion compensated interpolation filter is used to reconstruct the original image.

 Three-dimensional subband decompositions for hierarchical video coding  Frank Bosveld  ,  Reginald L. Lagendijk  ,  Jan Biemond     
 Show abstract   
 With the introduction of a multitude of video and multimedia services in the context of broadband communication networks, compatibility between various different data compression systems is becoming increasingly important. Significant research efforts have been recently directed towards so-called hierarchical coding schemes that provide compatibility by splitting the source signal into several hierarchical layers. Compatibility is achieved in this way since a receiver selects and decodes only those layers which are relevant for its (fixed resolution) display monitor. In this paper we introduce and investigate two hierarchical spatio-temporal subband decompositions; the so-called ’full’ and ’reduced temporal hierarchy’ decompositions. The former supports progressive-scan video signals only while the latter is capable of handling interlaced signals as well. The better frequency discrimination of the ’full temporal hierarchy' decomposition is expected to lead to higher coding performances for the interlaced signals but has a higher complexity.

 Cheops: a modular processor for scalable video coding  V. Michael Bove Jr.  ,  John A. Watlington     
 Show abstract   
 We describe the Cheops Imaging System, a small, parallel video processing and display system for real time experiments in video coding and interactive image-based applications. The modular structure of the system allows it to evolve to meet new application requirements or to employ new processing chips as they are developed.   

 Subband video-coding algorithm and its feasibility on a transputer video coder  Sergio C. Brofferio  ,  Elena Marcozzi  ,  Luigi Mori  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 This work presents current results of an applied research aimed at defining a fixed-quality variable bit-rate coding algorithm suitable to run on workstations used for different visual communication applications in ATM networks. Subband coding has been chosen due to its suitability and effectiveness in coding both fixed and moving images in such an environment: both FIR and HR filter banks have been designed and tested considering various issues such as their space and frequency characteristics and computational complexity. Adaptive quantization based on statistical properties and subjective relevance of the different subbands has been realized with the use of a marginal analysis procedure. Finally, the feasibility of a Transputer based implementation of the algorithm in a reduced-complexity form is considered.

 Estimation and prediction of object-oriented segmentation for video predictive coding  Sergio C. Brofferio  ,  Domenico Comunale  ,  Stefano Tubaro     
 Show abstract   
 The research proposes a simple finite state image model for estimating video sequence motion field, background memory updating and luminance prediction. The model allows object-oriented segmentation utilizing a fuzzy state (New-Scene) so that state transitions diagrams, modeling the physical constraints can be defined both for image segmentation and for luminance prediction. Preliminary results for integrated image segmentation and displacement fields estimations are presented. The proposed algorithm allows the implementation of video coding schemes where only structural prediction errors have to be transmitted, when physical motion coherence is plausible, and which is suited for completely parallel distributed processing.

 Statistically optimized PR-QMF design  Hakan Caglar  ,  Yipeng Liu  ,  Ali Naci Akansu     
 Show abstract   
 A multivariable optimization problem is set to design 2-band PR-QMFs in this paper. The energy compaction, aliasing energy, step response, zero-mean high-pass filter, uncorrelated subband signals, constrained nonlinearity of the phase-response, and the given input statistics are simultaneously considered in the proposed optimal filter design technique. A set of optimal PR-QMF solutions and their optimization criteria along with their energy compaction performance are given for comparison. This approach of PR-QMF design leads to an input driven adaptive subband filter bank structure. It is expected that these optimal filters outperform the well-known fixed PR-QMFs in the literature for image and video coding applications.

 Fast finite-state codebook design algorithm for vector quantization  Ruey-Feng Chang  ,  Wen-Tsuen Chen     
 Show abstract   
 The Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm is usually used to design a codebook for encoding images in the vector quantization. In each iteration of this algorithm, we must search the full codebook in order to assign the training vectors to their corresponding codewords. Therefore, the LBG algorithm needs large computation effort to obtain a good codebook from the training set. In this paper, we propose a finite-state LBG (FSLBG) algorithm for reducing the computation time. Instead of searching the whole codebook, we search only those codewords that are close to the codeword for a training vector in its previous iteration. In general, the number of these possible codewords can be very small without sacrificing performance. Because of searching only a small part of the codebook, the computation time is reduced. In our experiment, the performance of the FSLBG algorithm in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio is very close to that of the LBG algorithm. However, the computation time of the FSLBG algorithm is only about 10 percent of the time required by the LBG algorithm.

 Coding of motion vectors for motion-compensated predictive/interpolative video coder  Cheng-Tie Chen  ,  Fure-Ching Jeng     
 Show abstract   
 Motion vectors are side information vital to motion-compensated predictive/interpolative interframe video coding algorithms. This paper is concerned with the coding efficiency for this motion information. It is demonstrated that coding differential motion vectors is not always advantageous. An adaptive strategy is thus considered to automatically select the most favorable mode to code the motion information. The effects of video noise to motion estimation and coding are also investigated. A simple linear filtering scheme is used to reduce the noise effects. Simulation results show a significant performance improvement for noisy video by using this simple filtering scheme.   

 Highly efficient entropy coding of multilevel images using a modified arithmetic code  Yan-Ping Chen  ,  Yasuhiko Yasuda     
 Show abstract   
 In this paper, firstly we present a modified multiplication-free arithmetic, code that can improve the efficiency of the conventional multiplication-free arithmetic code by increasing the numbers of the estimated probability from 2 to 3 in a power unit range. Then, we describe the application of this modified algorithm to the entropy coding of multi-level images. In our entropy coding scheme, the multi-alphabet symbol string, which is input from the sequence of the zig-zag scanning data obtained by applying the ADCT compression algorithm to the original image, can be directly sent to the encoder, i.e., there is no need to decompose the symbols into a series of binary decisions. Finally, some simulation results will be given to show that good performance can be achieved with our coding scheme.   

 Probabilistic model for quadtree representation of binary images  Chun-Hsien Chou  ,  Chih-Peng Chu     
 Show abstract   
 A quadtree is a compact data structure widely used in many areas for representing binary region data. In this paper, a probabilistic model for quadtree coding of binary images is presented. The binary image to be encoded can be modeled as a first-order Markov process, and the quadtree representation of binary images can be modeled as a branching process. Based on these two mathematical models and the Huffman code, a recursive equation is obtained to estimate the code length for the quadtree representation of a binary image. The simulation results show that, with the measured statistical parameters and a proper value assigned to a dependent parameter, the differences between the bit rates of the theoretical estimation and the experimental results are in average within 5%.

 High-speed programmable digitizer for real-time video compression experiments  Norman R. Cox     
 Show abstract   
 A flexible digital video simulator has been constructed so that the effects of image coding and compression can be observed and evaluated in real time. This paper describes the design of the simulator's digitizer which includes the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, the digital-to-analog (D/A) converter, and the programmable clock synthesizer. Although this system is presently being used for processing National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) composite video signals, it can be reconfigured for processing other image transmission formats. Examples include red, green, and blue (RGB) component signals, luminance and chrominance (YIQ) signals, and enhanced-definition television (EDTV) signals.   

 Motion Estimation and Motion Analysis   
    
 Motion field estimation for complex scenes  Johannes Nicolaas Driessen  ,  Jan Biemond     
 Show abstract   
 The estimation of motion fields from an image sequence is a difficult problem for scenes containing moving and overlapping objects. In these cases, the problem is to simultaneously estimate the motion field and detect both the motion discontinuity and the uncovered region. We propose a new model that is based on three simple first order coupled Markov Random Fields (MRF’s), where the coupling accounts for the interaction between the three processes. The simultaneous problem is then reformulated as the minimization of an energy function associated with the chosen MRF’s. This is a non-trivial minimization problem due to the binary nature of the motion discontinuities and the uncovered regions. We propose the use of a Deterministic Annealing algorithm, which can be interpreted as an interleaved iterative technique using continuation methods for the binary processes. Experimental results show that such an approach indeed leads to the detection of motion boundaries and uncovered regions, which in turn leads to a more accurate motion field estimate near the motion boundaries as well as the uncovered regions.

 Estimation of three-dimensional motion in a 3-DTV image sequence  Jean-Luc Dugelay     
 Show abstract   
 The article deals with 3D scene analysis for coding purposes and is part of general research into 3D television. The method proposed here attempts, through dynamic monocular analysis, to estimate three-dimensional motion and determine the structure of the observed objects. Motion and structure estimation are achieved by means of a differential method. A multipredictor scheme is used to guarantee correct initialisation of the algorithm. Images are segmented according to spatio- temporal criteria, using a hierarchic method based on a quad-tree with overlapping. Segmentation and estimation are performed jointly.

 Digital video codec for medium bitrate transmission  Touradj Ebrahimi  ,  Frederic Dufaux  ,  Iole Moccagatta  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 A digital video codec is presented, using a fast Gabor-like wavelet transform to produce a multiresolution data set. Three difFerent strategies are introduced to code different levels of the resolution in the pyramidal data according to their visual importance. A hierarchical vector quantization is performed to exploit the inter/intra subbands correlations. A multiresolution block matching is proposed to generate the motion field in the scene. These motion vectors are then used to reduce the temporal redundancies. Simulations show good results in quality for medium bitrate transmission.

 Superhigh-definition image processing on a parallel signal processing system  Tetsuro Fujii  ,  Tomoko Sawabe  ,  Naohisa Ohta  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 This paper describes a new parallel image processing system called "NOVI-II HiPIPE" that manipulates super high definition (SHD) images. This system consists of 128 processing nodes, 4 I/O nodes for image storage, and 4 I/O nodes for SHD still image display. It provides extremely high computational power and high throughput rates for SHD image processing. This system can transfer image data to the newly developed Super Frame Memory (Super FM) for SHD moving image display via the Ultra-network. A new Vector Processor (VP), which has a peak performance of 100 MFlops, is developed and the performance of an engineering sample version of this chip is checked. One VP will be installed in each processing node as the DSP engine and a total system performance of 12.8 Gflops (peak performance) is expected from NOVI-II HiPIPE. Using this system, various image coding schemes and computer graphics techniques can be easily explored in spite of the huge amount of data that must be treated.

 Motion video coding for packet-switching networks: an integrated approach  Michael Gilge  ,  Riccardo Gusella     
 Show abstract   
 The advantages of packet video, constant image quality, service integration and statistical multiplexing, are overshadowed by packet loss, delay and jitter. By integrating network-control into the image data compression algorithm, the strong interactions between the coder and the network can be exploited and the available network bandwidth can be used best. In order to enable video transmission over today’s networks without reservation or priorities and in the presence of high packet loss rates, congestion avoidance techniques need to be employed. This is achieved through rate and flow control, where feedback from the network is used to adapt coding parameters and vary the output rate. From the coding point of view the network is seen as data buffer. Analogously to constant bit rate applications, where a controller measures buffer fullness, we attempt to avoid network congestion (eq. buffer overflow) by monitoring the network and adapting the coding parameters in real-time

 Image vector quantization with block-adaptive scalar prediction  Smita Gupta  ,  Allen Gersho     
 Show abstract   
 A novel method for block coding of images is presented which combines 2-D scalar prediction with vector quantization. The input image is divided into spatially contiguous, non-overlapping square blocks and the inherent spatial nonstationarity is modeled by adaptation of the scalar predictor to each block. A new technique for the quantization of predictor coefficients is introduced which ensures the stability of the resultant inverse prediction error filter. Simulation results show that the predictor adaptation method leads to significantly improved performance compared to a coder with a fixed predictor for a nominal increase in the overall bit rate. When compared with predictive vector quantization, our coder provides higher coding gain and better perceptual quality.

 Motion-compensated priority discrete cosine transform coding of image sequences  Serafim N. Efstratiadis  ,  Yunming George Huang  ,  Z. Xiong  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 In this paper a new motion compensated (MC) predictive coding method for image sequences is presented. This method utilizes a prediction of the displacement vector field (DVF) in order to produce a MC prediction error which is coded and transmitted using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the Partition Priority Coding (PPC) approach. Assuming that two previous frames are available both at the transmitter and the receiver, the DVF corresponding to the previous frame is estimated. Then, based on this estimate a temporal prediction of the DVF at the current frame is obtained. This way there is no need to transmit the DVF. Using the predicted DVF, the MC prediction error is obtained. It is then transformed and the irrelevancy reduction is carried out using the PPC method. According to this method, the transform coefficients are ordered based on their magnitude and, therefore, magnitude and location information is transmitted. Due to the properties of the MC prediction error, PPC proves to be very suitable. The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested on standard video-conferencing image sequences. Significantly improved results were obtained compared to previously reported DCT and Priority DCT based methods without MC in terms of reduced bit-rate and quality of the reconstructed image sequence.

 Color/texture analysis and synthesis for model-based human image coding  Satoshi Ishibashi  ,  Fumio Kishino     
 Show abstract   
 This paper proposes an efficient color/texture analysis and synthesis method for the model-based coding of human images. A shade and shadow elimination scheme is also introduced enhance texture analysis. The input human image is segmented into uniform color regions; color/texture data of each region is analyzed through the first and second order statistics. The synthesis process generates the color/texture of each region from the analyzied data and shading data, which is created from a three dimensional human body model and the new virtual lighting source. The proposed method acquires and encodes the objects’ original color/textures independently of shade and can reconstruct the color/textures while applying any shade effect desired.

 Hierarchical block motion estimation for video subband coding  Joon-Hyeon Jeon  ,  Cheul-hee Hahm  ,  Jae-Kyoon Kim     
 Show abstract   
 In this paper, a new hierarchical motion estimation scheme is proposed for progressive video coding based on subband divisions. It is based on the hierarchical block matching for a pass-band pyramid, where each layer of image except the top-most layer has the pass-band image reconstituted by use of only three highpass subbands. Using this scheme, since the quantization error at a given layer exits at only the image of the layer, the coding performance can be improved by exact motion estimation. We also present a method to encode the residueferror frame) in the pyramid structure. It is found that the hierarchical block motion estimation based on the pass-band layers is better than the base-band layers, especially when the quantization is included through transmission.

 Bayesian approach to segmentation of temporal dynamics in video data  Coleen T. Jones  ,  Ken D. Sauer     
 Show abstract   
 We present an algorithm for Bayesian estimation of temporally active spatial regions of video sequences. The algorithm improves the effectiveness of conditional replenishment for video compression in many applications which feature a background/foreground format. For the sake of compatibility with prevalent block-type coders, the binaryvalued segmentation is constrained to be constant on square blocks of 8x8 or 16 x 16 pixels. Our approach favors connectivity at two levels of scale. The first is at the individual pixel level, where a Gibbs distribution is used for the active pixels in the binary field of supra-threshold interframe differences. The final segmentation also assigns higher probability to patterns of active blocks which are connected, since in general, macroscopic entities are assumed to be many blocks in size. Demonstrations of the advantage of the Bayesian approach are given through simulations with standard sequences.

 Performance evaluation of subband coding and optimization of its filter coefficients  Jiro Katto  ,  Yasuhiko Yasuda     
 Show abstract   
 In this paper, two analytical methods to evaluate coding performance of subband coding are proposed, and optimization of its filter coefficients from the viewpoint of energy compaction property is considered. The first method is based on matrix representation of subband coding in time domain, where the coding gain given by Jayant and Noll is introduced as a performance measure for filter banks with orthogonal property. The second method is based on optimum bit allocation problem for subband coding (multirate filter bank), where the unified coding gain is derived as a new performance measure which can be applied to arbitrary transform techniques. We then try to find filter coefficients which maximize the unified coding gain according to input characteristics. This approach leads to optimization of filter coefficients from the viewpoint of energy compaction property.

 In this paper we outline a new approach to transform coding of four-color printed images employing variable blocksizes in connection with cpiadtree data structures. A new statistical model based decision criterion for guidance of the quadtree decomposition is proposed. This decision criterion avoids drawbacks of simple deviation tests or detail measures and can easily be extended towards multi-color segmentation. To account for the greatly varying local image content found in printed images, a highly adaptive threshold coding concept using an activity/entropy block classification scheme is introduced. Segmentation results as well as average compression ratios for the proposed system will be given.

 Method to convert image resolution using M-band-extended QMF banks  Masahisa Kawashima  ,  Hideyoshi Tominaga     
 Show abstract   
 A new method to convert image resolution using M-band extended QMF is proposed. Due to the parallel structure ofthe filter banks, the conversion ratio of the proposed method is not constrained to be a power of 2. Moreover, since theproposed method performs the filtering of signals by convolution operations, the resolution converted image by theproposed scheme is free from the aliasing which occurs in that by the DCT method. Judging from the experimentalresults, it is concluded that the resolution converted image by the proposed scheme is superior to that by the DCTmethod.   

 Subband decomposition procedure for quincunx sampling grids  Chai Wook Kim  ,  Rashid Ansari     
 Show abstract   
 Filters with diamond shaped passbands and stopbands are used in image and video processing for several different tasks, one of which is the subband decomposition of signals. This subband decomposition can be carried out in a tree-structured manner by using diamond prefilters followed by downsampling on quincunx grids at each stage. In order to use such a decomposition in hierarchical coding it is desirable to choose the lowpass filter to be a halfband filter so as to limit the amount of aliasing in the low frequency component of the signal at each stage. This paper addresses the design and implementation of a two-channel filter bank for such an application. A special class of one-dimensional (1-D) prototype filters is used to derive the filter banks. The procedure is based on obtaining a halfband filter using a pair of lower order halfband filters. The resulting solutions preserve the exact reconstruction property even when the filter coefficients are quantized, a property which is useful in implementation. Examples of such filter banks are presented.

 Classified vector quantizer based on minimum-distance partitioning  Dongsik Kim  ,  Sang Uk Lee     
 Show abstract   
 In this paper, we describe a new classified vector quantization (CVQ) technique employing the minimum-distance classifier to reduce the encoding complexity required in the full search vector quantization (VQ). The determination of the optimal subcodebook sizes for each class is an important task in the CVQ. However, we propose a CVQ technique, which, with an equal subcodebook size, suboptimally satisfies the optimal CVQ condition described in [4]. In addition, a cluster modifying algorithm, which alleviates the local minimum problem in the clustering algorithm, is proposed to ensure the optimal CVQ condition. The proposed CVQ is a kind of the partial search VQ because it requires a search process through each subcodebook only. However, simulation result reveal that the performance of the proposed CVQ is almost comparable to that of the full search VQ, while the encoding complexity is only 6.5 % of that required in the full search VQ.

 Block arithmetic coding of contour images  Kyoil Kim  ,  Jonglak Kim  ,  Taejeong Kim     
 Show abstract   
 In this paper, we proposed two new contour coding techniques based on the arithmetic code, called block arithmetic coding and pre-processed block arithmetic coding. These techniques are intended to be used in the region-based image coding, and efficiently take advantage of the characteristics of the contour images. Blocks of pels in a contour image are treated as non-binary symbols. The efficiency of the binary arithmetic code is extended to coding of non-binary symbols via tree structured arrangement of binary arithmetic codes. The performances of the proposed techniques are compared with those of the techniques already reported, such as chain codes, READ codes, ordering techniques, and binary arithmetic codes. By computer simulations, the proposed techniques are shown to outperform any other existing technique.

 Transmission of the motion of a walker by model-based image coding  Tadahiko Kimoto  ,  Yasuhiko Yasuda     
 Show abstract   
 To the scene of a human walker a model-based image coding scheme is applied for transmission of a human motion. In our scheme, the motion of a whole human body is represented in 3-D stick motion. A 3-D human stick model is supposed to walk in the limited way. The structure parameters that form the model and the motion parameters that represent the motion of a walker are defined for the model. These parameters are estimated from an input image sequence by motion analysis. Here, this image sequence is a monocular one obtained with one fixed video camera. To improve the range in which the motion of a walker is represented, three stick models with different degrees of coarseness are used. An algorithm for estimating the parameters of these models in the order of coarseness is presented. The stick motion estimated from the experimental scene has been shown. Also, transmission of the estimated parameters is discussed. Because of the order in which parameters are estimated, the transmission delay in our scheme becomes at least the period of one step.

 A variable bit-rate HDTV coding algorithm based on motion-adaptive DCT is investigated for ATM environments in B-ISDN. Adaptive 2-layered coding, an ATM cell matrix for error correction, and a block interleave for error concealment are proposed to keep picture quality high by compensating for ATM cell loss. A new VLC and a congestion control scheme that restricts peak-rate and average-rate are also proposed for traffic control. The proposed algorithm is shown to reduce the coding bit-rate for HDTV conference applications in ATM environments to 10-30 Mb/s.

 Digital Imaging Systems have been deployed in many scientific and military applications such as space research, aerial photography, weather forecasting and CAD/CAM. More recently, because of price/performance improvement in many technologies, digital imaging systems are finding more applications in many commercial/business environments such as banking, insurance, legal and the health care industry. Image capture, processing, compression, storage, display and transport-all these constitute important elements of emerging imaging systems. These elements can be assembled to build systems meeting appropriate end-user requirements. During the past three to four years, the investment in imaging systems in the U.S. has increased at an annual rate of over 30 percent, both in the public and private sectors. The business of imaging is relatively new; it can grow manifoldly in existing markets as well as create new market opportunities.   

 High-resolution color image coding scheme for office systems  Yutaka Koshi  ,  Setsu Kunitake  ,  Kazuhiro Suzuki  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 There is great interest in having office systems that adopt the image coding to enable high resolution and high quality document management. Network-based office systems require two classes of procedures. The first requires a new “ internal coding” scheme for integrated image processing and editing operations. The second corresponds to image data interchange between system components through the network and can be implemented using conventional image coding scheme such as JPEG. This paper deals with a new image coding scheme which is designed for internal coding facility based on the adaptive block truncation coding. This scheme can perform block by block fixed rate coding and editing within an encoded form. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed scheme at compression ratios of 4 to 8.   

 Characteristic analysis of color information based on (R,G,B)-> (H,V,C) color space transformation  Qing Gan  ,  Makoto M. Miyahara  ,  Kazunori Kotani     
 Show abstract   
 Most of the color image processing terminals and workstations available today do not support full color quality, and they describe colors, in an ordinary way, by red, green and blue signals. The colors are unable to be reproduced exactly due to limitations imposed by the analog-to-digital conversion. In this paper we investigate the reproduction errors caused by quantization in a space where the coordinates represent the excitation of the three attributes involved in color vision. Further, a procedure to limit the color quantizing error under the condition of "just noticeable difference or very little difference in visual perception" is proposed. It is found that to acquire a high quality color representation which can express the subtle color variety, the quantizing accuracy is required more than 42 bits per set of (R,G,B) signals.

 Motion compensation by block matching and vector postprocessing in subband coding of TV signals at 15 Mbit/s  Fabrice Lallauret  ,  Dominique Barba     
 Show abstract   
 This work deals with a new coding method for transmitting TV signals at 15 Mbit/s. The coding scheme is based upon sub-band decomposition by Pseudo-QMF filtering and motion compensation. In that context we have studied the influence on the overall system of various strategies in the motion compensation block. More precisely, in the case of a motion compensation by block matching, the influence of overlapping between the blocks has been first considered. A new non-linear post processing scheme of the displacement vector is also presented which smoothed pretty well the vector field and reduced significantly the vector coding bit rate. Finally various methods of vector coding have been designed and compared.

 Block-adaptive quantization of multiple-frame motion field  Fabio Lavagetto  ,  Riccardo Leonardi     
 Show abstract   
 This paper presents a method for the adaptive quantization of the motion field obtained from multiple reference frames. The motion estimation is obtained through a block-matching technique, with the assumptions of pure translational motion and uniform motion within a block. The regular assumption of constant intensity along the motion trajectory in the spatio-temporal path is relaxed. On one hand, this allows for illumination changes between the reference frames and the frame to be motion-compensated. On the other hand, it allows for additional freedom to reduce the prediction error after motion-compensation when the translational and rigid body motion assumptions are violated. The matching function represents the difference for each block of the luminance signal in the frame to be encoded with respect to a linear combination of 2 displaced blocks of same size in the reference frames. The adaptive quantization mechanism is based on evaluating, on a block basis, the local sensitivity of the displaced frame difference signal to a quantization of the motion field parameters. It is shown how such sensitivity depends only on the reference frame signals, which allows to keep it below a desired threshold without additional information to be sent to a receiver. Simulations are carried out on standard CIF (240x360) source material provided to the ISO/MPEG. Results are discussed to show the improvement with respect to the strategy suggested in the draft recommendation of the ISO MPEG for interactive video at 1.5 Mbps.

 Construction of efficient variable-length codes with clear synchronizing codewords for digital video applications  Shawmin Lei     
 Show abstract   
 Variable-length codes are widely adopted for lossless data compaction in many digital video applications, e.g., videophone and high definition television (HDTV). However, error propagation is still a major concern for practical applications. In general, since there are no explicit word-boundaries in the variable-length coded data stream, a transmission error will cause the succeeding codewords to be decoded erroneously. One way to confine the error propagation is through the periodic use of synchronizing words that have a special bit pattern which can be recognized in the coded bit stream as long as there are no errors in the words itself. We call such codewords “clear” codewords. A basic property of the clear codewords is that they cannot be formed by any concatenation of other codewords. These clear codewords are useful not only for the detection and confinement of errors but also for the multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple variable-length coded bit streams. The construction of efficient variable- length codes with clear codewords is an interesting and important issue for many practiced applications.

 Design of parallel multiresolution filter banks by simulated annealing  Wei Li  ,  Andrea Basso  ,  Ashok Chhabedia Popat  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 A new simulated annealing technique is described for designing multiresolution, parallel-structured filter banks with finite wordlength coefficients. The algorithm is based on a two stage optimization. In the first stage, a perturbation following uniform distribution is used; while in the second stage, perturbation is in Gaussian distribution, allowing a faster convergence. The filter banks have properties which make them well suited to image subband coding applications. In particular, they provide joint localization in the spatial and spectral domains, and allow no leakage of DC into higher subbands. This paper describes the algorithm and presents design examples.

 Lapped orthogonal transform for motion-compensated video compression  William E. Lynch  ,  Amy R. Reibman     
 Show abstract   
 Two common techniques for compressing digital video are motion-compensated interframe coding and transform coding. In this paper, we combine the Lapped Orthogonal Transform (LOT) with motion compensated (MC) temporal prediction. The statistical structure of the MC frame differences is distinct from than that of still images. Therefore, we introduce a new lapped transform (the straddle LOT (SLOT)) which considers the structure of the MC frame differences. The combination of the conventional LOT with the SLOT, when applied to the entire image, forms the motion-compensated LOT (MCLOT). We demonstrate, both theoretically and on actual images, that the MCLOT outperforms the conventional LOT when applied to MC frame differences.

 Signal extension and noncausal filtering for subband coding of images  Stephen A. Martucci     
 Show abstract   
 This paper addresses two issues of concern when implementing filter banks for subband coding of images: filter causality and filtering of the finite-length rows and columns of the image. A new framework for analyzing the effect of noncausal analysis filtering on the aliasing cancellation properties of the two-band filter bank system is presented. A general solution is given to the problem of how to extend finite-length signals before filtering so that expansion of the subband signal size can be avoided but perfect reconstruction remains. It will be shown how the methods of circular convolution and symmetric extension provide this solution. When using the symmetric extension method, how the signal is extended and the amount of delay the analysis filters may impart are highly constrained. Both even-length and odd-length FIR filters may be used, but extension is different in the two cases.

 When an image is compressed using the cosine transform algorithm it is traditional to separately quantize the coefficients with an (Even) Max Quantizer. The Odd Max Quantizer is generally used at high compression ratios since although it is less efficient it is visually more pleasing. Using a very simple coding scheme, we show how the intrinsic inefficiency of the Odd Max Quantizer may be virtually eliminated.

 A subband coding (SBC) scheme, exploiting the dependencies that exist across the bands, is developed which can effectively compress the upper frequency bands of the decomposed image. An edge-detecting filter is incorporated into the SBC model that extracts the edge-pixels in the base-band, and identifies the locations of their counterparts in the upper-bands accordingly without transmission of any overhead information. A memoryless vector quantizing (VQ) scheme was used to encode the base-band: Once the edge-detected reconstructed base-band became available, another VQ coding scheme was employed to encode the upper frequency components across the bands in conjunction with the error derived due to the decoded base-band, only at edge locations. High quality 512 x 512 images were reconstructed at ~ 0.7 bits/pixel.

 Iterative motion estimation method using triangular patches for motion compensation  Yuichiro Nakaya  ,  Hiroshi Harashima     
 Show abstract   
 In order to overcome the drawback of the conventional block-based motion compensation, a new triangle-based method which utilizes triangular patches instead of blocks has recently been proposed. Compared to conventional methods which represent the motion of scene objects by translational displacements of blocks, the new method can cope with a wider range of motions since it allows for rotation and deformation of the triangular patches. In the block-based motion compensation, a simple local minimization algorithm (i.e. block matching) is applied to obtain the displacement vector of each block. However it is inappropriate to apply this algorithm in the triangle-based motion compensation because of the complicated linkage between the deformation of the triangular patches and the displacements of the grid points (vertices of triangles). Consequently, the primary issue is to find an optimal way to estimate motion of the grid points. In this paper we present a new motion estimation algorithm called hexagonal matching which iteratively refines the estimated displacement vectors. Simulation results show that the motion estimation algorithm produces less prediction error than the previously proposed triangle-based method or the block-based method. We also propose another algorithm with similar function but less computational complexity.

In transform domain, a classified discrete cosine transform / vector quantization (CDCT/VQ) scheme is proposed and TCCCDCT/VQ is developed based on the CDCT/VQ scheme. These two techniques are applied to encode test images at about 0.51 BPP and 0.73 BPP.

 Motion estimation in hybrid image sequence coders is commonly done with block matching. In this paper we present another approach using detailed motion estimates for compensation. Such motion estimates have given good results when applied for frame interpolation[1]. In our case they enable us to reduce the prediction error significantly at the cost of a more complex motion estimate. We thus code this motion estimate with loss coming to a tradeoff between the accuracy of the estimate and the amount of bits necessary to send it as side information to the receiver. Our simulation results show that the same performance range as with a block matching based coder is reached.

Coding efficiency is evaluated by simulation. The proposed techniques improve subjective quality of decoded pictures.   

 Practical approach to fractal-based image compression  Alexander P. Pentland  ,  Bradley Horowitz     
 Show abstract   
 Fractal techniques for image compression have recently attracted a great deal of attention. Unfortunately, little in the way of practical algorithms or techniques have been published. We present a technique for image compression that is based on a very simple type of iterative fractal. In our algorithm a wavelet transform (quadrature mirror filter pyramid) is used to decompose an image into bands containing information from different scales (spatial frequencies) and orientations. The conditional probabilities between these different scale bands are then determined, and used as the basis for a predictive coder. We find that the wavelet transform’s various scale and orientation bands have a great deal of redundant, self-similar structure. This redundant structure is, however, in the form of multi-modal conditional probabilities, so that linear predictors perform poorly. Our algorithm uses a simple histogram method to determine the multi-modal conditional probabilities, between scales. The resulting predictive coder is easily integrated into existing subband coding schemes. Comparison of this fractal- based scheme with our standard wavelet vector coder on 256 x 256 grey-level imagery shows up to a two-fold gain in coding efficiency with no loss in image quality, and up to a four-fold gain with small loss in image quality. Coding and decoding are implemented by small table lookups, making real-time application feasible.

 Arithmetic coding model for compression of LANDSAT images  Arnulfo Perez  ,  Sei-ichiro Kamata  ,  Eiji Kawaguchi     
 Show abstract   
 The compression of LANDSAT images using Hilbert or Peano scanning and adaptive arithmetic coding is considered. The Hilbert scan is a general technique for continuous scanning of multidimensional data. Arithmetic coding has established itself as the superior method for lossless compression. This paper extends on previous work on the integration of the arithmetic coding methodology and a n-dimensional Hilbert scanning algorithm developed by Perez, Kamata and Kawaguchi. Hilbert scanning preserves the spatial continuity of an image, on both the x and y directions and a higher correlation exists between continuous points than in a raster scan. Therefore, a Hilbert adaptive scheme can better estimate the local probability distributions. Arithmetic coding is most efficient when the probabilities of the symbols are close to one. Therefore by integrating both the spatial and spectral information into a unified context a high rate of compression can be achieved.

 Subband coding of video using energy-adaptive arithmetic coding and statistical feedback-free rate control  Ashok Chhabedia Popat  ,  Andre Nicoulin  ,  Andrea Basso  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 An improved video subband coding technique is presented. It is based on a spatially and spectrally localizing subband analysis, followed by scalar quantization and direct arithmetic coding. The quantization and coding parameters are adapted on the basis of local energy of the subband pixels. The proposed technique automatically achieves near-optimal rate allocation with respect to mean-square error (or alternatively, weighted mean-square error). In addition, because arithmetic coding requires no alphabet extension, the quantized subband pixels can be encoded in an arbitrary order without affecting bit rate. This makes it possible to obtain a good statistical estimate of the quantization resolution required to achieve a certain overall bit rate, based on a relatively small random sample of the subband pixels and their corresponding energies. The proposed technique requires that estimates of the local energy of the subband pixels be encoded and sent to the receiver as side-information. A means of accomplishing this, using vector quantization (VQ), is mentioned.

 Adaptive perceptual quantization for video compression  Atul Puri  ,  R. Aravind     
 Show abstract   
 International standards bodies snch as the ISO and CCITT have established various expert groups to standardize compressed digital representations of color image and video signals for different applications. Here we are concerned mainly with the work of the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG), whose charter is to specify a generic coded representation of video and audio. The MPEG work has been divided into three distinct phases, the first aimed at compressing low-resolution (1/4 CCIR-601) pictures at data-rates in 1-4 Mbits/sec, the second at compressing full CCIR-6O1 resolution pictures at data-rates in 4-10 Mbits/sec, and the third at compressing HDTV pictures at appropriately higher data-rates.

 Fast piecewise-constant approximation of images  Hayder Radha  ,  Martin Vetterli  ,  Riccardo Leonardi     
 Show abstract   
 In this work, we present a Least-Square-Error (LSE), recursive method for generating piecewise -con stant approximations of images. The method is developed using an optimization approach to minimize a cost function. The cost function, proposed here, is based on segmenting the image, recursively, using Binary Space Partitionings (BSPs) of the image domain. We derive a LSE necessary condition for the optimum piece wise-constant approximation, and use this condition to develop an algorithm for generating the LSE, BSP-based approximation. The proposed algorithm provides a significant reduction in the computational expense when compared with a brute force method. As shown in the paper, the LSE algorithm generates efficient segmentations of simple as well as complex images. This shows the potential of the LSE approximation approach for image coding applications. Moreover, the BSP-based segmentation provides a very simple (yet flexible) description of the regions resulting from the partitioning. This makes the proposed approximation method useful for performing image affine transformations (e.g., rotation and scaling) which are common in computer graphics applications.

 Temporal projection for motion estimation and motion compensating interpolation  Philippe Robert     
 Show abstract   
 In this paper, the problems of motion field estimation and motion compensating interpolation are considered. It is shown that motion temporal projection increases the accuracy of the motion estimation when used as a temporal prediction. Moreover, this process carries information about the occluding, appearing and disappearing areas. A label field is introduced in order to emphasize and memorize this information, and a simple method leads to the detection of such areas. In a second step, the motion and label fields are used for motion compensating interpolation. Motion temporal projection is used to define the motion field of the image to be interpolated. The information carried by the label field is propagated along the motion vectors in the image to be interpolated. This procedure leads to detect the foreground objects and correctly estimate their motion, and to detect the appearing and disappearing areas and adapt the interpolation to these particular areas.

 High-speed two-dimensional pyramid image coding method and its implementation  Haralambos Sahinoglou  ,  Sergio D. Cabrera     
 Show abstract   
 A non-separable pyramid scheme is developed for coding of images to achieve a high compression rate. The method allows a very efficient algorithmic implementation, using only 2 additions and a shift (division by 2) for each image pixel during coding or decoding. Since the operations needed are mostly independent of each other and have a high degree of regularity, it is also possible to design VLSI hardware to perform this operation using an array of simple basic cells. At the same time high coding efficiency results: for a typical 513x513 image we can achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB with an encoding whose entropy is 0.133 bits per pixel. This information can be encoded using a method as simple as PCM, while still requiring only 0.385 bits per pixel, giving a very simple overall coding system.

 High-fidelity subband coding for superhigh-resolution images  Takahiro Saito  ,  Hirofumi Higuchi  ,  Takashi Komatsu     
 Show abstract   
 Super high resolution images with more than 2,000*2.000 pixels will play a very important role in a wide variety of applications of future multimedia communications ranging from electronic publishing to broadcasting. To make communication of super high resolution images practicable, we need to develop image coding techniques that can compress super high resolution images by a factor of 1/10 to 1/20. Among existing image coding techniques, the sub-band coding technique is one of the most suitable techniques. With its applications to high-fidelity compression of super high resolution images,one of the major problem is how to encode high frequency sub-band signals. High frequency sub-band signals are well modeled as having approximately memoryless probability distribution, and hence the best way to solve this problem is to improve the quantization of high frequency sub-band signals. From the standpoint stated above, the work herein First compares three diferent scalor quantization schemes and improved permutation codes, which the authors have previously developed extending the concept of permutation codes, from the aspect of quantization performance for a memoryless probability distribution that well approximates the real statistical properties of high frequency sub-band signals, and thus demonstrates that at low coding rates improved permutation codes outperform the other scalor quatization schemes and that its superiority decreases as its coding rate increases. Moreover, from the results stated above, the work herein, develops rate-adaptive quantization techniques where the number of bits assigned to each subblock is determined according to the signal variance within the subblock and the proper quantization scheme is chosen from among different types of quantizaton schemes according to the allocated number of bits, and applies them to the high-fidelity encoding of high frequency sub-band signals of super high resolution images to demonstrate their usefulness.

 Motion affine models identification and application to television image coding  Henri Sanson     
 Show abstract   
 This paper addresses two-dimensional motion analysis in the context of television image coding and presents a method achieving the identification of motion models per region in television-like image sequences. The proposed algorithm associates a downward hierarchical image analysis and a differential estimation of the model parameters, where the estimation of the dense velocity field and its approximation by a given model in the sense of weighted least squares are combined in an iterative process. The basic version of the algorithm performs the identification of affine models per block. However, the differential estimation of movement parameters extends straightforwardly to higher order models. Furthermore, the general scheme of the algorithm can be simply modified in order to achieve joint estimation and segmentation of the movement.

 Two-layer pyramid image coding scheme for interworking of video services in ATM  Thomas Sikora  ,  Thiow Keng Tan  ,  Khok Khee Pang     
 Show abstract   
 A layered Pyramid image coding scheme suitable for interworking of videoconferencing and videophone services is presented in this paper. The scheme proposed takes advantage of inter-layer embedded motion prediction to compress image data on the upper Pyramid enhancement layer. As an important advantage of this scheme we have preserved independence of the coding in the two layers using embedded motion compensation. Thus no information about the coding procedure on the lower resolution layer is needed to encode the upper layer enhancement information. The results are encouraging, showing that the scheme reconstructs images of both CIF and QCIF resolution with good quality and that the scheme is more data efficient than a comparable Simulcast approach.

 Model-based coding of facial images based on facial muscle motion through isodensity maps  Ikken So  ,  Osamu Nakamura  ,  Toshi Minami     
 Show abstract   
 A model-based coding system has come under serious consideration for the next generation of image coding schemes, aimed at greater efficiency in TV-telephone and TV-conference systems [l]-[5]. In this model-based coding system, the sender’s model image is transmitted and stored at the receiving side before the start of conversation. During the conversation, feature points are extracted from the facial image of the sender, and are transmitted to the receiver. The facial expression of the sender facial is reconstructed from the feature points received and a wireframe model constructed at the receiving side.

 Laplacian pyramid coding of prediction error images  Christoph Stiller  ,  Dirk Lappe     
 Show abstract   
 Pyramid image coding is an important class of encoding for progressive transmission. Image data is represented in a hierarchical structure and is transmitted in the order of decreasing significance. This property can be exploited for image sequence coding. Pyramid encoding allows to adapt to the statistics of prediction error images and to the available residual data rate. In this paper a Laplacian image pyramide is employed for coding the prediction error image of a hybrid image sequence coder. A tree growing algorithm for bit assignment within the pyramid is introduced for maximization of a quality criterion in the overall reconstructed image. Experiments show reasonable image quality even for low bit rates as 8 kbit/s.

 Subsampled vector quantization with nonlinear estimation using neural network approach  Huifang Sun  ,  Constantine N. Manikopoulos  ,  Hwei P. Hsu     
 Show abstract   
 An intraframe block coding scheme which is devoted to of using interblock redundancy and reducing the block effect is proposed. The scheme is based upon a combination of a nonlinear interpolation with transform and vector quantization techniques. Interblock redundancy is removed by extracting a pixel from each block as a common seed to interpolate the rest of the pixels of the neighboring blocks. The estimation error signals are reduced by nonlinear interpolation, which often results in no further processing requirements for some blocks. This saving compensates for the cost of transmitting the overhead of the estimation parameters.

 Analysis of optimum-frame-rate in low-bit-rate video coding  Yasuhiro Takishima  ,  Masahiro Wada  ,  Hitomi Murakami     
 Show abstract   
 We analyze frame rates in low bit rate video coding and show that an optimal frame rate can be theoretically obtained. In order to achieve an optimum balance between coded picture quality and motion smoothness, a frame rate has to be selected which is appropriate to parameters such as coding scheme, property of the video signals and coding bit rate. In this paper, coding distortion measured by mean square error due to quantization is analyzed by modeling video signals, and it is shown that the frame rate can be uniquely optimized. The result of this analysis is compared with the results of computer simulation. In addition, the relation between this analysis and the subjective evaluation is described.

 3-D TV: joined identification of global motion parameters for stereoscopic sequence coding  Ahmed Tamtaoui  ,  Claude Labit     
 Show abstract   
 Efficient compression techniques for stereoscopic sequences (3DTV) are required for storage and transmission purposes. One general approach for image sequence coding is based on motion compensation schemes. We propose a new method which enables a joined estimation of global motion descriptor vectors both for left and right sequences. The estimation of descriptors in stereoscopic sequences presented in this paper generalizes pel-recursive methods using steepest descent algorithms subject to some constraints of coherence. In the case of parallel estimations (on the left and right views), eight descriptors can characterize the motion of two matched regions. By the coherent estimation detailed here, only five descriptors can represent the motion of two matched regions. Results are evaluated according to reconstruction errors and qualitative interpretation of apparent motion fields.

 Secret transmission method of character data in motion picture communication  Kiyoshi Tanaka  ,  Yasuhiro Nakamura  ,  Kineo Matsui     
 Show abstract   
 A secret transmission method of character data is presented in this paper when a series of motion pictures are communicated between two stations. Character data are embedded into the codes of image data to be output from the interframe DPCM encoder, so as to prevent a third party from reading the message; The received data are normally decoded to a picture in higher quality and the message is also decoded at the same time if the receiver knows how to embed it. It results in our experiments that the transmission of character data has little effect on picture quality and the amount of embedded characters will be estimated to be about 20 ~ 30% of bits transmitted in each frame, for example, when SNR is above 30dB.

 The subband scheme is one of the most promissing schemes for super HDTV coding. In this paper, we propose two types of multidimensional multichannel subband scheme. Using the concept of the complementary subsampling, the properties of the analysis and synthesis filters axe analyzed. Coding gain is calculated for the proposed scheme by using a picture model. The proposed scheme shows coding gain higher than the conventional scheme.

 Model for packet image communication in a centralized distribution system  Habib H. Torbey  ,  Zhensheng Zhang     
 Show abstract   
 The distribution of the compressed image data volume for a lossless image coder is derived from the distribution of the uncompressed images and that of the coder's compression ratio. This result is used to identify the parameters of an on-off statistical source model characterizing the still image source as seen by the network. The on-off source model gives rise to a batch arrival queueing model to represent image transmission over a network in the situation where there exists a mismatch in the speed of the different components of an imaging system. For a centralized distribution system in particular, the model arises when the transmission queueing delay is the bottleneck at the database and when the arrival rate at a network node is much faster than the transmission node. While the overall time delays can be kept very low, the average buffer sizes build up considerably prompting the need for flow control and for queueing the image requests rather than the image data at the database.

 The CCITT Recommendation H.261 [1] describes the video coding and decoding method for the moving picture component of audiovisual services at the rates of px64 kbit/s, where p is in the range 1 to 30. Accordingly, several chip sets realizing these methods have been announced[3,4,5,6]. In this paper, a new architecture and implementation of an adaptive coding controller chip is reported. The main features of the chip include: (A) Adaptive Weighted Image Quality Control Capability, (B) High Speed Operation and (C) External Control Capability for Coding Control. The chip is implemented with CMOS standard cells and contains approximately 38,000 gates.

 Video compression algorithm with adaptive bit allocation and quantization  Eric Viscito  ,  Cesar A. Gonzales     
 Show abstract   
 The emerging ISO MPEG video compression standard is a hybrid algorithm which employs motion compensation, spatial discrete cosine transforms, quantization, and Huffman coding. The MPEG standard specifies the syntax of the compressed data stream and the method of decoding, hut leaves considerable latitude in the design of the encoder. Although the algorithm is geared toward fixed-bit- rate storage media, the rules for bit rate control allow a good deal of variation in the number of bits allocated to each picture. In addition, the allocation of bits within a picture is subject to no rules whatsoever. One would like to design an encoder that optimizes visual quality of the decoded video sequence subject to these bit rate restrictions. However, this is difficult due to the elusive nature of a quantitative distortion measure for images and motion sequences that correlates well with human perception. This paper describes an MPEG encoder designed to produce good quality coded sequences for a wide range of video source characteristics and over a range of bit rates. The novel parts of the algorithm include a temporal bit allocation strategy, spatially adaptive quantization, and a bit rate control scheme.

 Signal loss recovery in DCT-based image and video codecs  Yao Wang  ,  Qin-Fan Zhu     
 Show abstract   
 This paper presents a new technique fpr image reconstruction from a partial set of transform coefficients in DCT image coders. By utilizing the correlation between adjacent blocks and imposing smoothing constraints on the reconstructed image the proposed algorithm produces an image which is maximally smooth among all the images with the same available coefficients. The optimal solution can be obtained either by a linear transformation or through an iterative process. The underlying principle of the algorithm is applicable to any unitary block-transform and is very effective for recovering the DC and other low frequency coefficients. Applications in DCT based still image codecs and video codecs using motion compensation have been considered. Simulation results with still images show that a very good reconstruction can be obtained even when DC and certain low frequencies are missing in many blocks .

 Windowed motion compensation  Hiroshi Watanabe  ,  Sharad Singhal     
 Show abstract   
 A new motion compensation technique using a window which satisfies the perfect reconstruction condition is proposed. The conventional motion compensation using rectangular blocks often gives discontinuities between neighboring motion compensation blocks in the predicted image. The proposed method is based on a window operation to the data which overlaps an area of the conventional motion compensation block. Computer simulation is carried out using MPEG video coding algorithm to evaluate the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method is better than the conventional method in terms of mean square error, and large improvement can be obtained at the block boundaries. This gives a smooth predicted image for a typical MC+DCT coding scheme.

 Enhancement of transform coding by nonlinear interpolation  Siu-Wai Wu  ,  Allen Gersho     
 Show abstract   
 In conventional transform coding, a linear transformation generates a set of transform coefficients for each image block, followed by quantization of the transform coefficients and inverse transformation. We show that for a given transform encoder, the conventional decoder employing inverse transformation is a special case of a nonlinear interpolative decoder that performs table lookups to reconstruct the image blocks from the code indexes. In the nonlinear interpolative decoder, each received code index of an image block addresses a particular codebook to fetch a component block. The image block is then reconstructed as the vector sum of the component blocks. Hence with a set of well designed codebooks, this new decoding technique will be superior to the conventional decoder. In this paper, we develop an iterative algorithm for designing a set of locally optimal codebooks. We also present a hybrid decoder which combines conventional decoding with nonlinear interpolative decoding to reduced the memory requirement for codebook storage. Computer simulations with the JPEG image compression algorithm demonstrate that this new decoding technique can decode enhanced quality pictures from the bit stream generated by the standard encoding scheme.

 HDTV compression with vector quantization of transform coefficients  Siu-Wai Wu  ,  Allen Gersho     
 Show abstract   
 We present a video coding scheme that uses vector quantization (VQ) in conjunction with die discrete cosine transform (DCT) for compression of high definition television (HDTV) signals. Motion compensated field prediction is applied with a group-of-fields structure where the first field in a group is compressed by intrafield coding and consecutive fields in the group are coded with motion compensation. Instead of using a channel buffer to regulate the transmission rate of the bit stream, we set a target bit rate for each field and dynamically allocate bits in the field to code it efficiently. The motion compensated field difference (MCFD) is coded by an algorithm similar to that used in intrafield coding. An MCFD field (or original video signal in the intrafield mode) is first partitioned into non-overlapping 8x8 image blocks. Each block is transformed into a block of DCT coefficients, which are then partitioned into a set of low dimensional vectors. Vector quantization is used to code the vectors of DCT coefficients. Furthermore, in the intrafield mode, a second stage of vector quantization in the spatial domain can be used to code the error image that results from die DCT coding in the first stage. Under the fixed bit rate constraint for a field, a greedy algorithm with a perceptual distortion criterion is applied to select the DCT vectors and residual vectors to be coded. Simulation results demonstrated that the algorithm can be used for compression of HDTV at 45 Mb/s with distribution quality.

 Recently, image service systems using data compression techniques are increasingly required. In such systems, coding algorithm is expected to be insensitive to channel noise as well as to have good source coding performance.

 Show abstract   
 Multiresolution representation of signal is effective for signal processing. In this paper, the relationship between the multirate filtering and Wavelet transform is described. It is indicated that the design of M-band perfect reconstruction multirate filter banks can be interpreted as the construction of the multiresolution Wavelet bases with resolution step M. With this observation, a set of formulations for the design of perfect reconstruction FIR multirate filter banks is derived. Also, the experimental results are presented and discussed.

 Motion-compensated wavelet transform coding for color video compression  Ya-Qin Zhang  ,  Sohail Zafar     
 Show abstract   
 A video compression scheme based on the wavelet representation and multi-resolution motion estimation (MRME) is presented in this paper. The multiresolution/multifrequency nature of the discrete wavelet transform lends itself an ideal tool for representing images and video signals. Wavelet transform decomposes a video frame into a set of sub-frames with different resolutions corresponding to different frequency bands. These multiresolution frames also provide a representation of the global motion structure of the video signals at different scales. The motion activities for a particular sub-frame in different resolutions are hence highly correlated since they actually specify the same motion structure at different scales. In the MRMC described in Section 4, motion vectors in higher resolution are predicted by the motion vectors in the lower resolution, and are refined at each step. In particular, we propose a variable block-size MRMC scheme in which the size of a block is adapted to its level in the pyramid. This scheme not only considerably reduces the searching and matching time but also provides a meaningful characterization of the intrinsic motion structure. The variable-size MRMC approach also avoids the drawback of the constant-size MRMC in describing small object motion activities. After wavelet decomposition, each scaled wavelet tends to have different statistical properties. An adaptive truncation process similar to [CHEN 84] was implemented and a bit allocation scheme similar to that in the transform coding is examined by adapting to the local variance distribution in each scaled wavelet. Based on the wavelet representation, variable-size MRMC approach and a uniform quantization scheme, four variations of the proposed motion-compensated wavelet video compression system are presented in Section 6. It is shown that the motion-compensated wavelet transform coding approach out-performs the conventional transform coding scheme in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio as well as the subjective performance.

 Vector quantization of image pyramids with the ECPNN algorithm  Diego Pinto de Garrido  ,  William A. Pearlman  ,  Weiler A. Finamore     
 Show abstract   
 A recent algorithm for single rate vector quantization [1] is used for coding image pyramids. The algorithm, called entropy-constrained pairwise-nearest-neighbor (ECPNN), designs codebooks by merging the pair of Voronoi regions which gives the most decrease in entropy for a given increase in distortion. In terms of performance in the mean-squared-error sense the algorithm produces codebooks with the same performance as the ECVQ design algorithm [1,2]. The main advantage over ECVQ is that ECPNN algorithm enables much faster codebook design. A single pass through the ECPNN design algorithm, which progresses from larger to successively smaller rates, allows the storage of any desired number of optimal intermediate-rate codebooks. In the context of pyramid coding, this feature is especially desirable, since the ECPNN design algorithm must be run for each sub-band and storage of codebooks of different rates are required for each subband. Good results at 0.5 bpp, judged both visually and using peak-to-peak SNR criterion, have been obtained by coding image pyramids using ECPNN codebooks.   

 Tree-structured vector quantization with input-weighted distortion measures  Pamela C. Cosman  ,  Karen Oehler  ,  Amanda A. Heaton  ,  et al.    
 Show abstract   
 A greedy tree-growing algorithm is used in conjunction with an input-dependent weighted distortion measure to develop a tree-structured vector quantizer. Vectors in the training set are classified, and weights are assigned to the classes. The resulting weighted distortion measure forces the tree to develop better representations for those classes that are considered important. Results on medical images and USC database images are presented. A tree-structured vector quantizer grown in a similar manner can be used for preliminary classification as well as compression.

 Hierarchical motion-compensated deinterlacing  John W. Woods  ,  Soo-Chul Han     
 Show abstract   
 This paper introduces a new method of converting interlaced video to a progressively scanned video. The missing pixel values of the interlaced sequence are interpolated from past fields according to motion vectors found between the present and past. Hierarchical block-matching motion estimation is used in finding these motion vectors. This approach gives improved results over conventional de-interlacing methods such as median filtering and linear spatial interpolation.

 USENIX Security '25 Reviewing Model  

 Summary of main changes from previous editions   
 Major revisions are submitted and reviewed during the same submission cycle as the initial submission. 
   
 Submissions Deadlines  
 The Symposium will accept submissions in two cycles in 2025. For USENIX Security '25, the first deadline will be September 4, 2024  , and the second will be January 22, 2025  .  
 Review Process Outcomes  
 The reviewing process will result in one of the following four outcomes:  
 Accepted | In this case, reviewers either see no need for any required edits—the paper could be published as is—or trust the authors to make any required edits. 
  Accepted on Shepherd Approval | These papers offer sufficient contributions to be in the USENIX Security program, but the reviewers feel that some changes are needed. Reviewers expect that these changes are highly unlikely to reduce their enthusiasm regarding the paper being published. These can include text changes, clarifications, and presentation of missing results that do not require additional experiments. 
  Invited for Major Revision | A clear path exists to strengthen the paper to a state that is likely adequate for the paper to be accepted. The reviewers have identified a well-defined set of additions and changes necessary to bring the paper to this state. Unlike | Accepted on Shepherd Approval | , the effect of these changes is too unpredictable for it to be feasible to decide in advance whether a revised paper will be acceptable for publication (e.g., new experiments need to be run whose outcomes are uncertain). There is no guarantee that the paper will be accepted, but we expect a high acceptance rate for these papers (as currently happens with | Major Revisions | ). 
  Rejected | This outcome indicates that the reviewers do not see a well-defined path from the present state to acceptance. For example, reviewers may not see the scientific contribution as adequately significant, or the idea is acceptable but reviewers struggle to offer well-defined changes to address identified technical issues. Reviews for such papers will attempt to identify major changes that could move the paper toward a publishable state. | Authors may not resubmit these papers in the next review cycle. 
  Shepherding and Revision Processes  
 Authors of papers submitted to USENIX Security '25 that have been accepted on shepherd approval or invited for major revision may submit a revised version of their papers only within the review cycle during which the paper was originally submitted  . Such papers that were originally submitted in the first cycle of USENIX Security '25 may not be resubmitted in the second cycle.  
 For both Accepted on shepherd approval  and Invited for major revision  , each paper will have one shepherd  . This shepherd will be agreed upon by the reviewers, and will be in charge of communicating expectations to authors and, eventually, communicating whether the paper has met the criteria for acceptance. The shepherd may consult with other reviewers.  
 All shepherding activities will happen through anonymous author-visible comments on HotCRP. All reviewers will be able to see these exchanges.

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

 Conference Overview  
   
 In this digital age, data plays a crucial role Businesses/organizations across the globe are striving to analyze the data and identify the trends. Data evaluations also give organizations new insights to questions that they hadn’t even thought of. This creates a positive impact on discovering new business opportunities. Data visualization and visual analytics are two such ways to gain better insights into data. Though often used interchangeably, these two terms are inherently different as are their approaches to data. This International Conference on Visual Analytics and Data Visualization (ICVADV-2025) covers all research, development, and application aspects of Visual Analytics and Data Visualization. This international conference event intends to serve as a platform for discussing the recent advances in algorithms, methods, theory, and applications of visual analytics and data visualization. The conference encourages the discussion on recent findings in the design and utilization of data analytics and visualization tools.

 Conference Overview  
   
 In this digital age, data plays a crucial role Businesses/organizations across the globe are striving to analyze the data and identify the trends. Data evaluations also give organizations new insights to questions that they hadn’t even thought of. This creates a positive impact on discovering new business opportunities. Data visualization and visual analytics are two such ways to gain better insights into data. Though often used interchangeably, these two terms are inherently different as are their approaches to data. This International Conference on Visual Analytics and Data Visualization (ICVADV-2025) covers all research, development, and application aspects of Visual Analytics and Data Visualization. This international conference event intends to serve as a platform for discussing the recent advances in algorithms, methods, theory, and applications of visual analytics and data visualization. The conference encourages the discussion on recent findings in the design and utilization of data analytics and visualization tools.

 VECoS  
 Verification and Evaluation  
  of Computer and Communication Systems  

  The International Conference on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and Communication Systems (VECoS) was created by an Euro-Med network of researchers in computer science. The aim of the VECoS conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners, in the areas of verification, control, performance, quality of service, dependability evaluation and assessment, in order to discuss the state-of-the-art and the challenges in modern computer and communication systems in which functional and non-functional properties are strongly interrelated. Thus, the main motivation for VECoS is to encourage the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, and especially those based on the specification formalisms for concurrent, distributed and software/hardware systems. Beyond its technical and scientific goals, another main purpose of VECoS is to promote collaboration between participants in research and education in the area of computer science and engineering.

 VINCI 2024    
  
 Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among human beings of different backgrounds or cultures, and in recent decades between humans and machines. In today's digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly being used to facilitate human-human communication through the Internet and mobile devices.   
 VINCI is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the state of the art in visual communication theories, designs, and applications.  The 17th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction   (VINCI'24)   will be held during  December   11  -  13  , 2024, in Hsinchu, Taiwan.   
 VINCI'24 includes tracks of  Technical Papers  ,  Art Papers  , and  Art and Media Galleries  . All accepted papers will be included in the ACM Proceedings as formal publications and EI-indexed. Selected papers will be invited to be extended for publication i  n special issues of  PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality   (SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months) and   International Journal of Digital Media Design   (Taiwan Humanities Core Index)  .   

 Paper Submission    
  
 Submissions that address research and development and experience reports on the above topics are strongly encouraged. Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers and posters. Art and Media Galleries can be submitted as media demos and artworks. Each submitted symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee members. You are welcome to submit a paper to VINCI 2024. All accepted papers and posters will appear in the proceedings of VINCI 2024 published by ACM ICPS and made available in the  ACM Digital Library   (EI indexed). Authors of a number of selected full papers of high quality will be invited to prepare extended versions for submission to the  special issues of  PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality   (  SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months  ) and   International Journal of Digital Media Design   (  Taiwan Humanities Core Index  )  .   
 All paper submissions should be made through the  CMT    conference management system. The review process will be single-blind. We encourage to submit an anonymized version of your manuscript by removing all author and affiliation information from submissions and supplemental files as well as substituting your paper's ID number for the author's name. All submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the  ACM Proceedings Template    (using sigconf format/template double-column style) and should consist of a single PDF file.

 Tracks    

 Technical Papers:   
 A technical paper describes a new algorithm, technique, system, or theory that has not previously appeared in the literature. The description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent/qualified graduate student in visual information communication could implement or apply the work and should provide a formal/informal evaluation and discussion regarding its strengths and weaknesses.   
 The technical papers call is open-theme, and this year, we have three types in the Technical Papers: full papers, short papers and posters.   
 The page limits are strict so please ensure that you meet the requirements:   
 Full Papers: max. 8 pages INCL. references 
  Short Papers: max. 4 pages+1 extra page which contains ONLY referernces 
  Posters: max. 2 pages INCL. references 
  ACM also requires you to specify the CSS concepts in your paper. These can be found at:   http://dl.acm.org/ccs.cfm 
  Art Papers:   
 This track serves as a link between arts, design, technology, and science by offering creative views and artistic applications. We are especially interested in the submissions that demonstrate tangible and artistic ways of visual information communication and address information aesthetics. The topics range from experimental and interdisciplinary case studies and methodologies, novel and critical interfaces for VINCI topics to critical analysis of theory and reference works in the field.   
 The art papers call is open-theme, and this year, we have three types in the Art Papers: full papers, short papers and posters.   
 The page limits are strict so please ensure that you meet the requirements:   
 Full Papers: max. 8 pages INCL. references 
  Short Papers: max. 4 pages+1 extra page which contains ONLY  references

  ACM also requires you to specify the CSS concepts in your paper. These can be found at:  http://dl.acm.org/ccs.cfm 
  Art and Media Galleries:   
 The VINCI Art and Media Galleries celebrates artistic creations demonstrating conceptual and technological innovation related to visual information communication and interaction. We accept project topics, including data art, generative art and design, interactive graphics, real-time simulation, scientific illustration, creative and critical visualization, and more. The art and media g  aller  ies call is open-theme, and this year, we have two types in the Art and Media Galleries:  Media Demos  and  Artworks  .   
 Media Demos: It seeks submissions from media creators, producers, researchers, developers, startups, universities, institutes, companies, and others who can demonstrate novel experiences, productions, and applications (e.g., Metaverse or Digital Twin). 
  Artworks: It welcomes all forms and formats, exploring new artistic expression, creativity, and creation possibilities in any 2-dimensional form suitable for display on a digital screen or canvas. We also encourage submissions of innovative AIGC artworks. 
  Submissions for both types should include up to  2 pages  of poster/description/artist’s statement. Works should have been completed within the last 5 years (in or after 2019) and be ready for installation. While we don't restrict previously exhibited work, accompanying materials should not have been published or accepted for publication elsewhere.   
 Selected works will be exhibited at the National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University. We will collaborate with selected artists to discuss exhibition logistics and final display arrangements. Unless specified otherwise, artists are responsible for covering shipping costs for physical objects.

 Visual communication, using graphical or sign languages, has been a long-standing practice among individuals of diverse backgrounds or cultures. It has also evolved to include communication between humans and machines. In today's digital era, visual information is encoded using familiar metaphors to enhance comprehension and analysis. This encompasses information visualization, graphical user-interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly utilized for .. continue reading   human-human communication through the internet and mobile devices. The International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI) serves as a prominent platform for experts to discuss visual communication theories, designs, and applications. VINCI '23 will take place in Guangzhou, China. Selected papers may be published in The Visual Computer (Springer) and Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine and Art (Springer).

  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.  
 Pierre Caserta | , | Olivier Zendra | , | Damien Bodenes | : 3D Hierarchical Edge bundles to visualize relations in a software city metaphor. | [PDF] 
  Fabian Beck | , | Radoslav Petkov | , | Stephan Diehl | : Visually exploring multi-dimensional code couplings. | [PDF] 
  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.

  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.

  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.  
 Pierre Caserta | , | Olivier Zendra | , | Damien Bodenes | : 3D Hierarchical Edge bundles to visualize relations in a software city metaphor. | [PDF] 
  Fabian Beck | , | Radoslav Petkov | , | Stephan Diehl | : Visually exploring multi-dimensional code couplings. | [PDF] 
  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.

 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.

  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.  
 Pierre Caserta | , | Olivier Zendra | , | Damien Bodenes | : 3D Hierarchical Edge bundles to visualize relations in a software city metaphor. | [PDF] 
  Fabian Beck | , | Radoslav Petkov | , | Stephan Diehl | : Visually exploring multi-dimensional code couplings. | [PDF] 
  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.  
 Fang Deng | , | Nicholas DiGiuseppe | , | James A. Jones | : Constellation visualization: Augmenting program dependence with dynamic information. | [PDF] 
  A. N. M. Imroz Choudhury | , | Paul Rosen | : Abstract visualization of runtime memory behavior. | [PDF] 
  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.

 📣 Upcoming Edition: VISSOFT 2025  @ Auckland, New Zealand  
  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.  
 Pierre Caserta | , | Olivier Zendra | , | Damien Bodenes | : 3D Hierarchical Edge bundles to visualize relations in a software city metaphor. | [PDF] 
  Fabian Beck | , | Radoslav Petkov | , | Stephan Diehl | : Visually exploring multi-dimensional code couplings. | [PDF] 
  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.  
 Fang Deng | , | Nicholas DiGiuseppe | , | James A. Jones | : Constellation visualization: Augmenting program dependence with dynamic information. | [PDF] 
  A. N. M. Imroz Choudhury | , | Paul Rosen | : Abstract visualization of runtime memory behavior. | [PDF] 
  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.

 The State of (Viz) Security  
  The information security industry is changing rapidly (like always). It's worthwhile to take a moment to stop and look around to figure out if we are still on a good path. Join Jay Jacobs as he takes looks back over his career along with 12 years of VizSec and takes stock of where we are and some areas we should be moving towards.  
 Jay Jacobs is a Sr. Data Scientist at BitSight  , before that, he spent four years as the Lead Data Analyst on the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)  . Jacobs is the Co-Author of Data Driven Security  , a book covering data analysis and visualizations for information security, and hosts the Data-Driven Security podcast  . Jacobs is also a Co-Founder of the Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA)  and serves as President on their Board of Directors.  
  Panel  
 Moderators: LTC Stoney Trent, US Cyber Command and Anita D'Amico, Secure Decisions  
 Use of Visualizations in DoD Cyberspace Operations  
 While information visualization researchers and designers continue to develop new cyber security visualizations, little attention has been paid to how currently-fielded visualizations are actually used in cyberspace operations. Lathrop and Trent (2016) introduce the differences between traditional cyber security roles and expertise and emerging roles and technology requirements in cyber security operations. Cyber technologies and cyberspace operations organizations are co-evolving, so it is critical for researchers to understand practitioner perspectives. U.S. Cyber Command has established a research activity, the Cyber Immersion Lab, that is supporting such understanding. This panel, facilitated by the Cyber Immersion Lab, will provide an overview of the Cyber Mission Force and roles that perform cyberspace operations. Cyber Mission Force members will share insights into how visualizations are currently being used as well as perspectives on how currently-fielded visualizations fail to support real cyber work. Additional time will be reserved for questions and answers.

  When applicable, visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture the insights of human analysts and/or allow analysts to collaborate efficiently are particularly desirable.  
 Case Studies  
 New for 2016!  Short papers describing practical applications of security visualization are solicited. We encourage the submission of papers discussing the introduction of cyber security visualizations into operational context, including, but not limited to:  
 Cases where visualization made positive contributions towards meeting operational needs 
  Gaps or negative outcomes from visualization deployments 
  Situations where visualization was not utilized, but could have had a positive impact 
  Lessons learned from operational engagements 
  Insights gained from the transition process 
   
  Cyber security practitioners from industry, as well as the research community, are encouraged to submit case studies. Accepted case studies will be made available on this website.  
 Posters  
 Poster submissions may showcase late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, or visual representations relevant to the VizSec community. The poster program will be a great opportunity for the authors to interact with the attendees and solicit feedback. Accepted poster abstracts will be made available on this website.  
 Tests and Evaluation  
 When applicable, submissions including tests and evaluations of the proposed tools and techniques are considered particularly desirable. If possible, making the data used for the tests available will also be considered positively. If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at the VAST Challenge data sets.

 The State of (Viz) Security  
  The information security industry is changing rapidly (like always). It's worthwhile to take a moment to stop and look around to figure out if we are still on a good path. Join Jay Jacobs as he takes looks back over his career along with 12 years of VizSec and takes stock of where we are and some areas we should be moving towards.  
 Jay Jacobs is a Sr. Data Scientist at BitSight  , before that, he spent four years as the Lead Data Analyst on the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)  . Jacobs is the Co-Author of Data Driven Security  , a book covering data analysis and visualizations for information security, and hosts the Data-Driven Security podcast  . Jacobs is also a Co-Founder of the Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA)  and serves as President on their Board of Directors.  
  Panel  
 Moderators: LTC Stoney Trent, US Cyber Command and Anita D'Amico, Secure Decisions  
 Use of Visualizations in DoD Cyberspace Operations  
 While information visualization researchers and designers continue to develop new cyber security visualizations, little attention has been paid to how currently-fielded visualizations are actually used in cyberspace operations. Lathrop and Trent (2016) introduce the differences between traditional cyber security roles and expertise and emerging roles and technology requirements in cyber security operations. Cyber technologies and cyberspace operations organizations are co-evolving, so it is critical for researchers to understand practitioner perspectives. U.S. Cyber Command has established a research activity, the Cyber Immersion Lab, that is supporting such understanding. This panel, facilitated by the Cyber Immersion Lab, will provide an overview of the Cyber Mission Force and roles that perform cyberspace operations. Cyber Mission Force members will share insights into how visualizations are currently being used as well as perspectives on how currently-fielded visualizations fail to support real cyber work. Additional time will be reserved for questions and answers.

  Call for Papers  
 The 13th IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec provides an excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and privacy-related topics. VizSec will be held in Baltimore, MD, USA  in conjunction with IEEE VIS  , on Monday October 24th.   
 The purpose of VizSec is to explore effective and scalable visual interfaces for security domains such as network security, computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, user assisted attacks prevention, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing.  
 Technical Papers  
 Full papers describing novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques, applications, theory, analysis, experiments, or evaluations. We encourage the submission of papers on technologies and methods that promise to improve cyber security practices, including, but not limited to:  
 Situation awareness and/or understanding 
  Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response 
  Computer forensics 
  Recording and reporting results of investigations 
  Assisting proactive security configuration and deployment 
  Reverse engineering and malware analysis 
  Vulnerability management 
  Multiple data source analysis 
  Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense 
  Evaluation and/or user testing of VizSec systems 
  Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective) 
  Modeling system and network behavior 
  Modeling attacker and defender behavior 
  Studying risk and impact of cyber attacks 
  Predicting future attacks or targets 
  Security metrics and education 
  Software security 
  Mobile application security 
  Social networking privacy and security 
   
  When applicable, visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture the insights of human analysts and/or allow analysts to collaborate efficiently are particularly desirable.  
 Case Studies  
 New for 2016!  Short papers describing practical applications of security visualization are solicited. We encourage the submission of papers discussing the introduction of cyber security visualizations into operational context, including, but not limited to:  
 Cases where visualization made positive contributions towards meeting operational needs 
  Gaps or negative outcomes from visualization deployments 
  Situations where visualization was not utilized, but could have had a positive impact 
  Lessons learned from operational engagements 
  Insights gained from the transition process 
   
  Cyber security practitioners from industry, as well as the research community, are encouraged to submit case studies. Accepted case studies will be made available on this website.  
 Posters  
 Poster submissions may showcase late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, or visual representations relevant to the VizSec community. The poster program will be a great opportunity for the authors to interact with the attendees and solicit feedback. Accepted poster abstracts will be made available on this website.  
 Tests and Evaluation  
 When applicable, submissions including tests and evaluations of the proposed tools and techniques are considered particularly desirable. If possible, making the data used for the tests available will also be considered positively. If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at the VAST Challenge data sets.

 Welcome to VL/HCC 2024!  
  collocated with PPIG 2024   
   
 From the beginning of the computer age, people have sought easier ways to learn, express, and understand computational ideas. Whether this meant moving from punch cards to textual languages, or command lines to graphical UIs, the quest to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand by a broader group of people is an ongoing challenge.  
 The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing  is the premier international forum for research on this topic. Established in 1984, the mission of the conference is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  
 The 2024 symposium is scheduled to take place in September 2024 in Liverpool, United Kingdom, and will be collocated with PPIG 2024  , so you can anticipate some exciting shared sessions and interesting discussions! VL/HCC 2024 is Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing (TCMC).  
 On Monday 2 nd  September, we have three exciting satellite events running: the Joint VL/HCC & PPIG Graduate Consortium  , a Workshop on Addressing Challenges in Recruiting Participants for Human-Centric Computing Research Studies  , and a Tutorial on Exploring notation design  . The main VL/HCC 24 conference will then run from Tuesday 3 rd  September until Thursday 5 th  September, having a shared programme with PPIG  on Thursday 5 th  September, with PPIG running from Thursday 5 th  September until Friday 6 th  September.  
 VL/HCC is indexed in Scopus, DBLP, IEEE Explore, WoS.

 Call for Research Papers  
  
 Scope and Topics   
 We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.  
 Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Visual languages: Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations 
  Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming 
  End-user development, adaptation and programming, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development 
  Representations: Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization 
  Modeling: Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems 
  Thinking more deeply about code: Computational thinking and Computer Science education, Debugging and program understanding, Explainable ML/AI 
  Future of work with AI: Human-Centric AI-based tools, modeling end-user interactions with AI powered tools 
  Low Code/No Code paradigm: Approaches for creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces 
  If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!  
 Special Emphasis for 2024: VL/HCC and Generative AI   
 Generative AI has become a hot topic in many areas. How will it impact the field of Visual Languages and Human-centric Computing? We are particularly interested in works that critique Generative AI approaches from a human perspective, including a range of ethical considerations, and how Generative AI techniques are/may assist in engineering and understanding future computing systems from VL and/or HCC perspectives. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome.  
 Paper Submissions   
 We invite two kinds of papers:  
 full-length papers, up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  short papers, up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper.  
 Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper.  
 Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system  .  
 To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, we require paper abstracts to be submitted via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.  
 All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step the PC will make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2024 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.  
 The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/  ).  
 Co-location with PPIG Workshop   
 We will co-locate VL/HCC with the 35th Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), and are planning for joint sessions and events, and discounted joint registration.  
  https://www.ppig.org/workshops/2024-annual-workshop/   
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-anonymous reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase. Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs. The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.  
 Evaluation and Justification   
 Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.  
 However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.  
 Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims.  
 Replication papers will be evaluated on their own merit in terms of methods used, findings discussed and comparison to original studies in terms of different context or use of different methods.  
 Vision papers should make a case for future needs and research directions in VL and/or HCC community interest areas within a timeline of the next 5 to 10 years.  
 Industrial experience reports with VL and/or HCC topics should describe context, lessons learned (positive or negative), and recommendations for research and practice as appropriate.  
 We expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than full-length papers, and may have less technical detail, but sufficient to make the case for the contribution. New ideas and early research results would be expected to use a short paper format.  
 Adhering to IEEE Guidelines   
 Please be sure that your submission follows the IEEE requirements:  
 https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/   
 Especially around Human Subject approvals and use of Generative AI:  
 Research on Human and Animal Subjects   
 Excerpted from the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board (PSPB) Operations Manual, sections 8.1.1.E. Also see section 8.2.1.B.6: https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/PSPB/opsmanual.pdf   
 Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.  
 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text   
 The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.  
 The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

 Call for Research Papers  
  
 Scope and Topics   
 We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.  
 Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Visual languages: Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations 
  Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming 
  End-user development, adaptation and programming, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development 
  Representations: Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization 
  Modeling: Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems 
  Thinking more deeply about code: Computational thinking and Computer Science education, Debugging and program understanding, Explainable ML/AI 
  Future of work with AI: Human-Centric AI-based tools, modeling end-user interactions with AI powered tools 
  Low Code/No Code paradigm: Approaches for creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces 
  If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!  
 Special Emphasis for 2024: VL/HCC and Generative AI   
 Generative AI has become a hot topic in many areas. How will it impact the field of Visual Languages and Human-centric Computing? We are particularly interested in works that critique Generative AI approaches from a human perspective, including a range of ethical considerations, and how Generative AI techniques are/may assist in engineering and understanding future computing systems from VL and/or HCC perspectives. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome.  
 Paper Submissions   
 We invite two kinds of papers:  
 full-length papers, up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  short papers, up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper.  
 Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper.  
 Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system  .  
 To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, we require paper abstracts to be submitted via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.  
 All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step the PC will make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2024 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.  
 The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/  ).  
 Co-location with PPIG Workshop   
 We will co-locate VL/HCC with the 35th Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), and are planning for joint sessions and events, and discounted joint registration.  
  https://www.ppig.org/workshops/2024-annual-workshop/   
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-anonymous reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase. Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs. The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.  
 Evaluation and Justification   
 Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.  
 However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.  
 Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims.  
 Replication papers will be evaluated on their own merit in terms of methods used, findings discussed and comparison to original studies in terms of different context or use of different methods.  
 Vision papers should make a case for future needs and research directions in VL and/or HCC community interest areas within a timeline of the next 5 to 10 years.  
 Industrial experience reports with VL and/or HCC topics should describe context, lessons learned (positive or negative), and recommendations for research and practice as appropriate.  
 We expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than full-length papers, and may have less technical detail, but sufficient to make the case for the contribution. New ideas and early research results would be expected to use a short paper format.  
 Adhering to IEEE Guidelines   
 Please be sure that your submission follows the IEEE requirements:  
 https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/

 Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.  
 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text   
 The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.  
 The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

  VLDB 2025: Overview  
 The Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) is a premier annual international forum for data management, scalable data science, and database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users. The forthcoming VLDB 2025 conference is poised to deliver a comprehensive program, featuring an array of research talks, keynote and invited talks, panels, tutorials, demonstrations, industrial tracks, and workshops. It will cover a spectrum of research topics related to all aspects of data management, where systems issues play a significant role, such as data management system technology and information management infrastructures, including their very large scale of experimentation, novel architectures, and demanding applications as well as their underpinning theory.  
 Key areas of interest for PVLDB include, but are not limited to, data mining and analytics, data privacy and security, database engines, database performance and manageability, distributed database systems, graph and network data, information integration and data quality, languages, machine learning, ai, and databases, novel database architectures, provenance and workflows, specialized and domain-specific data management, text and semi-structured data, and user interfaces. These thematic pillars represent the foundational elements underpinning the technological landscape of the emerging applications of the 21st century.  
 The VLDB 2025 conference will take place from 1st to 5th September 2025 at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre (QEII Centre) in London, UK. Located in the heart of Westminster, the QEII Centre offers a prime setting, just a five-minute walk from the iconic River Thames and two minutes from the peaceful St James’s Park. This venue perfectly balances the convenience of a central urban location with the serenity of nearby natural landmarks.

 Welcome to VL/HCC 2023!  
   
 From the beginning of the computer age, people have sought easier ways to learn, express, and understand computational ideas. Whether this meant moving from punch cards to textual languages, or command lines to graphical UIs, the quest to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand by a broader group of people is an ongoing challenge.  
 The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing  is the premier international forum for research on this topic. Established in 1984, the mission of the conference is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  
 The 2023 symposium is scheduled to take place October 3-6 in Washington, DC, USA. VL/HCC 2023 is 100% Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing (TCMC).  
 VL/HCC is indexed in Scopus, DBLP, IEEE Explore, WoS.

 Call for Research Papers  
  
 Scope and Topics   
 We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.  
 Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Visual languages: Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations 
  Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming 
  End-user development: End-user development, adaptation and programming, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development 
  Crowdsourcing design and development work 
  Representations: Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization 
  Modeling: Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems 
  Thinking more deeply about code: Computational thinking and Computer Science education, Debugging and program understanding, Explainable ML/AI 
  If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!  
 Special Emphasis for 2023: Low-Code / No-Code Development   
 This year’s special topic is “Low-Code / No-Code Development”. This development paradigm enables the creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces and requiring little or no procedural code. This way, users are empowered to create software applications for constrained domains, even if they lack a programming background. This year, we especially welcome papers at VL/HCC that design, build, or evaluate any aspects of low-code and no-code solutions.  
 Paper Submissions   
 We invite two kinds of papers:  
 full-length research papers, up to 8 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  short research papers, up to 4 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system  .  
 To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, we require paper abstracts to be submitted via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be kept up to date such that it matches exactly the abstract in the submitted paper. The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.  
 All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper. Work-in-progress, which has not yet yielded an archival contribution, should be submitted to the Posters/Showpieces category. All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-blind review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step the PC will make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2023 and present the paper at the conference. There will be a virtual presentation option in case of travel restrictions. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.  
 The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/  ).  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 We follow a double-blind reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work  (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase.  
 Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.  
 Evaluation and Justification   
 Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.  
 However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.  
 Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims. In addition, we expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than long papers.

 Call for Research Papers  
  
 Scope and Topics   
 We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.  
 Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Visual languages: Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations 
  Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming 
  End-user development: End-user development, adaptation and programming, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development 
  Crowdsourcing design and development work 
  Representations: Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization 
  Modeling: Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems 
  Thinking more deeply about code: Computational thinking and Computer Science education, Debugging and program understanding, Explainable ML/AI 
  If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!  
 Special Emphasis for 2023: Low-Code / No-Code Development   
 This year’s special topic is “Low-Code / No-Code Development”. This development paradigm enables the creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces and requiring little or no procedural code. This way, users are empowered to create software applications for constrained domains, even if they lack a programming background. This year, we especially welcome papers at VL/HCC that design, build, or evaluate any aspects of low-code and no-code solutions.  
 Paper Submissions   
 We invite two kinds of papers:  
 full-length research papers, up to 8 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  short research papers, up to 4 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
  Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system  .  
 To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, we require paper abstracts to be submitted via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be kept up to date such that it matches exactly the abstract in the submitted paper. The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.  
 All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper. Work-in-progress, which has not yet yielded an archival contribution, should be submitted to the Posters/Showpieces category. All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-blind review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step the PC will make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2023 and present the paper at the conference. There will be a virtual presentation option in case of travel restrictions. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.  
 The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/  ).  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 We follow a double-blind reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work  (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase.  
 Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.

 Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.  
 However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.  
 Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims. In addition, we expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than long papers.

 Important Dates AoE (UTC-12)   
 October 1, 2024 | AOE : Paper submission deadline (extended). 
  November 11, 2024: Notification 
  November 22, 2024: Camera-ready version due 
  Submissions   
 Submissions are required to follow Springer’s LNCS format. The page limit depends on the paper’s category (see below). In each category, additional material beyond the page limit may be placed in a clearly marked appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers and to be omitted in the final version. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website  . Submission is via EasyChair  . Note: submissions will open on August 26th.  
 All accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The corresponding author of each paper will need to complete and sign a License-to-Publish form to be submitted together with the camera-ready version.  
 Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process. Submissions should not  be anonymized for the purposes of review. There will be three categories of papers: regular papers, tool papers and case studies. Papers in each category have a different page limit and will be evaluated differently.  
 Regular papers  clearly identify and justify an advance to the field of verification, abstract interpretation, or model checking. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Regular papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.  
 Tool papers  present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations with relevant citations, and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture and core data structures. A regular tool paper should give a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, describe experience with realistic case studies, and where applicable, provide a rigorous experimental evaluation. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly focus on the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, preferably substantiated by data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available and submit an artifact. Tool papers are restricted to 12 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.  
 Case studies  are expected to describe the use of verification, model checking, and abstract interpretation techniques in new application domains or industrial settings. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to present original research results but are expected to contain novel applications of formal methods techniques as well as an evaluation of these techniques in the chosen application domain. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting and reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience. Case study papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references. (Shorter case study papers are also welcome.)  
  
 Call for Artifacts  
  
 VMCAI 2025 makes available the option to submit an artifact along with a paper. Artifacts are any additional material that substantiates the claims made in the paper, and ideally makes them fully replicable. For some papers, these artifacts are as important as the paper itself because they provide crucial evidence for the quality of the results. The goal of artifact evaluation is twofold. On the one hand, we want to encourage authors to provide more substantial evidence to their papers and to reward authors who create artifacts. On the other hand, we want to simplify the independent replication of results presented in the paper and to ease future comparison with existing approaches. Artifacts of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Software, Tools, or Frameworks 
  Data sets 
  Test suites 
  Machine checkable proofs 
  Any combination of them 
  Any other artifact described in the paper 
  Artifact submission is optional  . However, we highly encourage all authors to also submit an artifact. A successfully evaluated artifact can increase your chance of being accepted since the evaluation result of your artifact is taken into account during paper reviewing.  
 Artifact evaluation is single blind, artifacts should not  be anonymous.  
 Badges   
 We award three types of badges, following the ACM guidelines  :  
 Available | for artifacts that are publicly available under a DOI. 
  Functional | for artifacts that are successfully evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Reusable | for functional artifacts that exceed in quality and additionally provide careful documentation to allow for future repurposing. 
  Important Dates AoE (UTC-12)   
 The artifact evaluation will be done in parallel with the evaluation of the submitted paper. Since VMCAI has a tight schedule, we ask authors who intend to submit their artifact for evaluation to register it in advance, so that on the artifact submission deadline, the AE committee members are already ready to start the test phase.  
  
 What | When 
 Artifact Registration | October 1, 2024. 
 Artifact submission deadline | October 3, 2024 
 Artifact test phase notification | October 10, 2024 
 Artifact notification | November 8, 2024 
  
 All artifacts are evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee. Each artifact will be reviewed by at least two committee members. Reviewers will read the paper and explore the artifact to evaluate how well the artifact supports the claims and results of the paper. The evaluation is based on the following questions.  
 Is the artifact consistent with the paper and the claims made by the paper? 
  Are the results of the paper replicable through the artifact? 
  Is the artifact complete, i.e., how many of the results of the paper are replicable? 
  Is the artifact well-documented? 
  Is the artifact easy to use? 
  The artifact evaluation is performed in the following two phases.  
 In the test phase, reviewers check if the artifact is functional, i.e., they look for setup problems (e.g., corrupted, missing files, crashes on simple examples, etc.). If any problems are detected, the authors are informed of the outcome and asked for clarification. The authors will get 3 days to respond to the reviews in case problems are encountered. 
  In the assessment phase, reviewers will try to reproduce any experiments or activities and evaluate the artifact wrt. the questions detailed above. 
  Artifact Submission   
 Submission page:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vmcai2025  (Choose the option to submit to the artifact evaluation track).  
 An artifact submission consist of:  
 the title | [artifact-NN] XX | where | XX | is the title of your paper and | NN | is its submission number, as assigned by Easychair in the | VMCAI’25 paper submission page | , 
  an abstract that summarizes the artifact and explains its relation to the paper, 
  the URL (preferably a DOI) from which a | .zip | or | .tar.gz | archive file containing the artifact can be downloaded, 
  the | SHA256 checksum | of the archive file, and 
  the | .pdf | file of the submitted paper. 
  The URL must point to independent services (such as Zenodo, Figshare, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, Github, Bitbucket, or (public) Gitlab), to help protect the anonymity of the reviewers.  
 You can generate the checksum using the following command-line tools:  
 Linux: | sha256sum <file> 
  Windows: | CertUtil -hashfile <file> SHA256 
  MacOS: | shasum -a 256 <file> 
  Submission Contents   
 Your artifact archive file must contain the following:  
 The main artifact, i.e., data, software, libraries, scripts, etc. required to replicate the results of your paper. | We recommend you provide easy to use scripts for the user to reproduce and analyze the results, i.e., scripts to run tools with the intended configuration and scripts to visualize their outcome as tables/plots. 
  The review will be singly blind. Please make sure that you do not (accidentally) learn the identify of the reviewers (e.g., through analytics, logging). 
  The logs from your experiments. | With the logs and the appropriate analysis script, we can easily match the outcomes reported in the paper. 
  A | LICENSE | file. Your license needs to allow the artifact evaluation chairs to download and distribute the artifact to the artifact evaluation committee members and the artifact evaluation committee members must be allowed to evaluate the artifact, e.g., use, execute, and modify the artifact for the purpose of artifact evaluation. 
  A | README.pdf | that introduces the artifact to the user and guides the user through the replication of your results. Ideally, it should consist of the following parts: | A | Getting Started Guide | detailing how to set up the artifact and prepare it for replicating the results from the paper. We would appreciate it if you supported the reviewers not only for the main review phase but also for the testing phase. To this end, it would be helpful to provide instructions that allow installation and rudimentary testing (i.e., in such a way that technical difficulties would pop up) in as little time as possible, together with the expected outcome of such rudimentary testing (to know whether it was successful). 
  Step-by-Step Instructions | for replicating the results from the paper. | Please document which claims or results of the paper can be replicated with the artifact and how (e.g., which experiment must be performed). Please also explain which claims and results cannot be replicated and why. 
  Describe in detail how to replicate the results in the paper, especially describe the steps that need to be performed to replicate the results in the paper. To simplify the reviewing process, we recommend to provide evaluation scripts (where applicable). 
  Precisely state the resource requirements (RAM, number of cores, CPU frequency, etc.), which you used to test your artifact. 
  Provide a rough estimate of the time needed to run the experiments. 
  For tasks that require a large amount of resources (hardware or time), we recommend to provide a possibility to replicate a subset of the results with reasonably modest resource and time limits, e.g., within 8 hours on a reasonable personal computer equipped with 8 GB of RAM. In this case, please also include a script to replicate only a subset of the results. 
  Artifact Packaging Guidelines   
 The preferred way to package your artifact is a Docker  image. This is to ensure that your artifact can be run on both traditional x86  (e.g. AMD and Intel processors) and newer arm  (e.g. Apple Silicon) platforms. To ensure that your artifact performs similarly on x86  and arm  , we recommend you submit one of the following:  
 a Docker build script (i.e. a | Dockerfile | ) if building the Docker image runs in reasonable time, or 
  pre-compiled Docker images for | x86 | and | arm | platforms. 
  Beware:  if you provide only an x86  image then Docker will emulate it on arm  platforms, and vice versa. Emulation will significantly impair performance.  
 Docker Images   
 Below is a quick start guide for producing Docker images provided you have an adequate Dockerfile  to generate you artifact. Please refer to the official Docker documentation  , in particular the one for cross-compilation  for further details and troubleshooting.  
 To create and export a Docker image native to your platform, you can do:  
 docker build . -t <artifact-name>:latest docker save -o <artifact-name>_<your_arch>.tar <artifact-name>:latest   For cross-compilation, Docker version 19.03  or newer provides buildx  on most platforms. First, create a new cross-compile builder:  
 docker buildx create --name mybuilder --driver docker-container --bootstrap docker buildx use mybuilder   Then, cross-compile and export a Docker image:  
 docker buildx build --platform linux/<other_arch> -t <artifact-name>:latest --load . docker save -o <artifact-name>_<other_arch>.tar <artifact-name>:latest   We recommend that you compress the resulting Docker images to reduce the overall size of you artifact. Please use a compression that is compatible with Docker load   , i.e., please use either gz  or xz  .  
 Virtual Machines   
 We discourage to package artifacts as virtual machine images as they are tricky if not impossible to run under MacOS running on Apple Silicon. However, should you be unable to use Docker, we will accept virtual machines compatible with VirtualBox  . Please indicate the use of a virtual machine image and the platform it is intended for in the abstract of your submission.   
 Publication of Artifacts   
 The artifact evaluation committee uses the submitted artifact only for the artifact evaluation. It may not publicize the artifact or any parts of it during or after completing evaluation. Artifacts and all associated data will be deleted at the end of the evaluation process. We encourage the authors of artifacts to make their artifacts also permanently available, e.g., on Zenodo  or figshare  , and refer to them in their papers via a DOI. All artifacts for which a DOI exists that is known to the artifact evaluation committee are granted the availability badge.
