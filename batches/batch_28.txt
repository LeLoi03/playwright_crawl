 The Twelfth AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing  
  October 16–19, 2024  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  @hcomp_conf  – #HCOMP2024   

 Welcome to HCOMP 2024!  
 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) will be held October 16-19th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will particularly focus on the theme of '' Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI  .''  
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.  
 HCOMP 2024 is colocated with ACM UIST 2024  (October 13-16, 2024).  
     
 HCOMP 2024 builds on a successful history of past meetings  : eleven HCOMP conferences (2013–2023) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).

 haisconference.eu | The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 AAAI Classic Paper Award  
  
 The AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of paper(s) deemed most influential, chosen from a specific conference year. Each year, the time period considered will advance by one year. The 2025 award will be given to the most influential paper(s) from the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  
 Papers will be judged on the basis of impact, for example:  
 Started a new research (sub)area 
  Led to important applications 
  Answered a long-standing question/issue or clarified what had been murky 
  Made a major advance that figures in the history of the subarea 
  Has been picked up as important and used by other areas within (or outside of) AI 
  Has been very heavily cited 
  All members of the artificial intelligence community are encouraged to submit nominations for this award. Candidacy is not limited to AAAI members, nor to people still active in artificial intelligence. Posthumous awards will be considered.  
 Nominations will be reviewed by the AAAI Awards Committee. Nominations are due September 20, 2024.  
 The award will be presented at the AAAI-25 conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. A total of $1,000 in travel support is available to enable the author(s) to travel to the conference to accept the award in person.

 HCW 2025  
 The thirty-fourth Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop ( HCW  ) will be held at the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, on June 4, 2025  . HCW is annually organized in conjunction with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS  ).  
 Heterogeneous computing systems comprise growing numbers of increasingly more diverse computing resources that can be local to one another or geographically distributed. The opportunity and need for effectively utilizing heterogeneous computing resources has given rise to the notions of cluster computing, grid computing, and cloud computing. HCW encourages paper submissions from both the research and industry communities presenting novel ideas on theoretical and practical aspects of computing in heterogeneous computing environments.  
 The HCW 2025 Call for Papers will be available mid-December.

 In conjunction with the 39 th  IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS 2025  )  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society  
  through the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP)  
 Most modern computing systems are heterogeneous  , either for organic reasons  because components grew independently, as it is the case in desktop grids, or by design  to leverage the strength of specific hardware, as it is the case in accelerated systems. In any case, all computing systems have some form of hardware or software heterogeneity   that must be managed, leveraged, understood, and exploited. The Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) is a venue to discuss and innovate in all theoretical and practical aspects of heterogeneous computing: design, programmability, efficient utilization, algorithms, modeling, applications, etc. HCW 2025 will be the thirty-fourth annual gathering of this workshop.  
 The Call for Papers will be available mid-December.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | .

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

The award recognizes the most impactful HCOMP paper published a decade ago (withstanding the test of 10 years worth of time). For the instantiation of this award, papers published at the conference until the year 2014 were considered.  
 The award will be received by Aashish Sheshadri and Matthew Lease for their AAAI HCOMP 2013 paper titled, '' Square: A benchmark for research on computing crowd consensus  .'' The paper presented an open source shared task framework including benchmark datasets, defined tasks, standard metrics, and reference implementations with empirical results for popular methods at the time of publishing. This paper was instrumental in shaping work related to crowd consensus and efforts to improve response aggregation in crowdsourcing. It has been the most cited HCOMP paper during this period, and been widely used as a resource in crowdsourcing courses at different universities.

 The purpose of the International Conference on Health Informatics is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the specification, design, development and application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to healthcare and medicine in general and to the support of persons with special needs in particular. Big data, networking, graphical interfaces, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition and intelligent decision support systems are just a few of the technologies and research areas currently contributing to medical informatics. Mobility and ubiquity in healthcare systems, physiological and behavioral modeling, standardization of health records, procedures, and technologies, certification, integration, scaling-up, privacy and security are some of the issues that medical informatics professionals and the ICT industry and research community in general are addressing to further promote ICT in healthcare. In the case of medical rehabilitation, assistive technologies, home monitoring, smart homes, research in and applications of ICT have contributed greatly to the enhancement of quality of life and full integration of all citizens into society.

 Call for Papers   
 HHAI 2025: The 4th International Conference Series on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence  
   June 9-13, 2025  
  Pisa, Italy  
  https://hhai-conference.org/2025/   
 Deadline for submission of abstracts: January 17, 2025 (paper submission: January 24, 2025)  
 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series that focuses on the study of Artificial Intelligence systems that cooperate synergistically, proactively and purposefully with humans, amplifying instead of replacing human intelligence. HHAI aims for AI systems that work together with humans, emphasizing the need for adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems. HHAI systems leverage human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses, while taking into account social, ethical and legal considerations.  
 HHAI 2025 will be held on June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy, and is the fourth conference in the series.  
 The HHAI field is driven by developments in AI, but it also requires fundamentally new approaches and solutions. Thus, we encourage collaborations across research domains such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy and ethics, complex systems, and others. In this fourth international conference, we invite scholars from these fields to submit their best original – new as well as in progress – works, and visionary ideas on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 HHAI 2025: The 4th International Conference Series on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence  
   June 9-13, 2025  
  Pisa, Italy  
  https://hhai-conference.org/2025/   
 Deadline for submission of abstracts: January 17, 2025 (paper submission: January 24, 2025)  
 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series that focuses on the study of Artificial Intelligence systems that cooperate synergistically, proactively and purposefully with humans, amplifying instead of replacing human intelligence. HHAI aims for AI systems that work together with humans, emphasizing the need for adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems. HHAI systems leverage human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses, while taking into account social, ethical and legal considerations.  
 HHAI 2025 will be held on June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy, and is the fourth conference in the series.  
 The HHAI field is driven by developments in AI, but it also requires fundamentally new approaches and solutions. Thus, we encourage collaborations across research domains such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy and ethics, complex systems, and others. In this fourth international conference, we invite scholars from these fields to submit their best original – new as well as in progress – works, and visionary ideas on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.

 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  May 27-31, 2024     
 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 HHAI 2025: The 4th International Conference Series on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence  
 June 9-13, 2025 (Pisa, Italy)   

 Hybrid Human Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) 2025  
  
 Welcome to HHAI2025   
 The pre-conference program (Mon+Tue) will take place at University of Pisa (Sapienza), and the main conference (Wed-Fri) at CNR  (Auditorium).  
 More information in the HHAI2025 Program page  will be published soon  

  Image by Christoph Schrattbauer  from Pixabay      

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series dedicated to exploring AI systems that work collaboratively, proactively, and purposefully alongside humans, enhancing rather than replacing human intelligence. The goal of HHAI is to develop AI systems that complement human abilities, highlighting the importance of adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive, and human-centered intelligence. These systems leverage human strengths and compensate for weaknesses, while also considering social, ethical, and legal implications.  
 The fourth HHAI conference will take place from June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy.   
 Though the HHAI field is propelled by advances in AI, it requires fundamentally innovative approaches and solutions. We encourage collaboration across various research areas such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy, ethics, and complex systems. For this fourth international conference, we invite researchers from these fields to submit their best original or ongoing work, as well as forward-looking ideas, on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI 2025)    

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series that focuses on the study of Artificial Intelligence systems that cooperate synergistically, proactively and purposefully with humans, amplifying instead of replacing human intelligence. HHAI aims for AI systems that work together with humans, emphasizing the need for adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems. HHAI systems leverage human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses, while taking into account social, ethical and legal considerations.  
 HHAI 2025 will be held on June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy, and is the fourth conference in the series.   
 The HHAI field is driven by developments in AI, but it also requires fundamentally new approaches and solutions. Thus, we encourage collaborations across research domains such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy and ethics, complex systems, and others. In this fourth international conference, we invite scholars from these fields to submit their best original – new as well as in progress – works, and visionary ideas on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

23. Conference HIPS_2:
HIPS 2024   
 The 29th HIPS workshop, held in conjunction with IPDPS 2024.  
 View My GitHub Profile   

 29th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments  
 Overview  
 The 29th HIPS workshop, proposed as a full-day meeting at the IEEE IPDPS 2024 conference in San Francisco, California, USA, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in the series, which was established in 1996 this event will serve as a forum for research in the areas of parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially encouraged innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures. An additional emphasis this year will be on post-von Neumann architectures and deep memories hierarchies to encourage new developments in programming models for HPC.

 Title: Architecture and Programming of Analog In-Memory- Computing Accelerators for Deep Neural Networks   
  Dr. HsinYu (Sidney) Tsai (IBM Research)   
 Abstract:  
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in AI, such as machine vision, natural language processing, and content generation. However, the growing energy usage due to the excessive amount of data communication between compute and memory units highlights the need to address the “Von Neumann bottleneck.” In-memory computing can achieve high throughput and energy efficiency by computing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s current law on arrays of resistive memory devices. In recent years, Analog non-volatile memory (NVM)-based accelerators with energy-efficient, weight-stationary MAC operations in analog NVM memory-array “Tiles” have been demonstrated in hardware using Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices integrated in the backend of 14-nm CMOS. Based on the hardware demonstrations, we propose a highly heterogeneous and programmable accelerator architecture that takes advantage of a dense and efficient circuit-switched 2D mesh. This flexible architecture can accelerate Transformer, Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) while keeping data communication local and massively parallel. We show that by co-optimizing memory devices, DNN algorithms, and specialized digital circuits, competitive end-to-end DNN accuracies can be obtained with the help of hardware-aware training. The author would like to thank all colleagues at IBM Research Almaden, Yorktown, Albany NanoTech, Zurich and Tokyo for their contributions to this work and the IBM Research AI HW Center.  
 Biography:  
  HsinYu (Sidney) Tsai received her Ph.D. from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2011. After graduation, Sidney joined the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and developed directed self-assembly (DSA) lithography for finFETs. Sidney managed an Advanced Lithography group in 2016, overseeing operations of a 200mm research prototyping line. She now works in the Almaden Research Center in San Jose, CA, as a Principal Research Staff Member and manager of the Analog AI group, focusing on training and inference of Deep Neural Networks using emerging non-volatile memories, such as Phase Change Memory.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 HIPS 2021 : International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments (HIPS)   

 Tags: Parallel Programming Models  | Environment  | System  | Compiler  | ML    
   
 Conference Date: 2021-05-17 to 2021-05-21   
   
 Location: Portland, USA + Virtual   

 The 26th HIPS workshop, to be held as a full-day meeting at the IPDPS 2021 conference in Portland and as virtual workshop, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in this series — established in 1996 — this event serves as a forum for research in the areas of parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially invite papers demonstrating innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures. An additional emphasis this year will be on heterogeneous compute capabilities and deep memories to encourage new developments in programming models for high performance systems.  
   
  == Topics of Interest ==  
   
  Topics of interest to the HIPS workshop include but are not limited to:  
  High-level and domain-specific programming systems  
  Languages and compilers for post-Moore's-Law (or Post Von Neumann)  
  Language/compiler support for AI/ML and Cybersecurity/Privacy (e.g., ML-based auto-tuning)  
  Task-based programming systems  
  (Scalable) programming tools and tools for power & performance analysis, modeling, monitoring, and debugging and core correctness  
  Compiler analysis and optimization techniques  
  OS and architectural support for parallel programming and debugging  
  Software and system support for extreme scalability including fault tolerance and power-aware HPC  
  Programming environments for heterogeneous multicore systems and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs  
  Solutions for programming paradigms for GPUs from different hardware vendors  
  Dynamism in applications and system resources  
  Performance portability  
  Efforts for improving the sustainability of scientific software  
  Languages and runtime support for multi-science/coupled codes, including but not limited to ensemble computing and uncertainty quantification  
  New programming languages and constructs for exploiting parallelism and locality  
   
  == Submissions ==  
   
  Submission deadline: 24th January 2021  
  Author notification: 16th February 2021  
  Camera-ready papers: end March 2021 (tba)  
   
  The HIPS paper style is identical to the IPDPS paper style.  
  Submitted manuscripts may not exceed 10 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and preferences.

 Call for Papers  
 The 26th Annual International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications  
  (ACM HotMobile 2025)  
   
  Sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE  
  February 26-27, 2025  
  Palm Springs, CA  
 ACM HotMobile 2025, the Twenty-sixth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.  
 We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over a “6-pages conference paper.”  
 We take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes:  
 Novel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility. 
  Operating system and distributed system support for mobile computing. 
  Wearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness. 
  HCI issues related to mobile computing. 
  Security and privacy of mobile computing. 
  Management, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility. 
  Wireless technology, as it pertains to mobile systems and applications. 
  Social issues related to mobile computing. 
  System and application support for the use of ML and AI on mobile platforms. 
  Important dates:  
 Hard | deadline for submissions: | October 11th, 2024, 11:59pm AoE 
  Acceptance notification: | December 16th, 2024 
    
 Presenting at HotMobile is a good way to get early feedback on research ideas at least one year away from a full-fledged conference submission to ACM MobiSys or other high-quality conferences. A full-length paper on the same topic submitted to a conference in less than a year is unlikely to include sufficient new material and mature ideas to warrant publication.  
 As is customary, papers must not have been published elsewhere and may not be simultaneously under submission at another venue. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread. As customary with the scientific peer review process, submissions will be handled as confidential material during the review.  
 Submissions should contain 6 or fewer U.S. letter pages in PDF format, including all references, figures and tables. The submissions should not be anonymous.  The submissions must meet the following formatting requirements:  
 Font size no smaller than 10pt. 
  Font size of the bibliography no smaller than 9pt. 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches x 11 inches). 
  We recommend the use of the "sigconf" ACM proceedings template, available at: http://www.acm.org/  , with the font size of the main body amended to 10pt. An example Tex document can be found here  . For more submission guidelines, please visit the conference website. Please note that it is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that the submissions are meeting all formatting requirements.  
 The papers accepted to HotMobile 2025 will be publicly available from the workshop's website for a limited time window, as per ACM's Digital Library's Policy.

 The 23rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2024) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.  
 We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; we consider well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations sufficient support for the possibility of the paper’s claims in HotNets.  
 We seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. We strongly discourage “conference papers in the miniature,” and the program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over something that is ready for publication at a conference. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at CoNEXT or IMC.  
 HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes new ideas that relate to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.  
 The program committee will select position papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.  
 Policy on Concurrent Submissions  
 Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2024 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues’ length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. “Concurrent” means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The “same work” means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the “same work” as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about this policy should contact the PC co-chairs before submitting.  
 Ethical Concerns  
 As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one’s institution’s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.  
 Workshop Participation  
 HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person (if authors have any concerns about this, they are welcome to contact the PC chairs). To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.  
 Submission and Formatting  
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 6 pages, excluding references, in 10 point font. There is no limit on the page count for references, however appendices are not allowed. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.  
 All submissions must be blind: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use "et al."). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Please make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected. This archive   contains a LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format. The hotnets24-template.tex  included in the archive has the correct defaults for HotNets 2024 submissions. Specifically, the first two lines should be:  
 \documentclass  [  sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm ]  {  acmart  }  \settopmatter  {  printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false }    The default citation style is numeric. Please do not modify the acmart.cls  file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.  
 Submit papers on the HotCRP   .

 The 23rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2024) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.  
 We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; we consider well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations sufficient support for the possibility of the paper’s claims in HotNets.  
 We seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. We strongly discourage “conference papers in the miniature,” and the program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over something that is ready for publication at a conference. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at CoNEXT or IMC.  
 HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes new ideas that relate to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.  
 The program committee will select position papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.  
 Policy on Concurrent Submissions  
 Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2024 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues’ length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. “Concurrent” means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The “same work” means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the “same work” as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about this policy should contact the PC co-chairs before submitting.  
 Ethical Concerns  
 As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one’s institution’s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.  
 Workshop Participation  
 HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person (if authors have any concerns about this, they are welcome to contact the PC chairs). To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.  
 Submission and Formatting  
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 6 pages, excluding references, in 10 point font. There is no limit on the page count for references, however appendices are not allowed. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.  
 All submissions must be blind: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use "et al."). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Please make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected. This archive   contains a LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format. The hotnets24-template.tex  included in the archive has the correct defaults for HotNets 2024 submissions. Specifically, the first two lines should be:  
 \documentclass  [  sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm ]  {  acmart  }  \settopmatter  {  printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false }    The default citation style is numeric. Please do not modify the acmart.cls  file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.

 Call for papers and discussions  
   
 The 20th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems hopes to bring together researchers and practitioners in computer systems to engage in a lively discussion on the principles and practices of building systems software. Continuing the HotOS tradition, participants will present new ideas and debate future research agendas in systems research.  
 We solicit position papers that propose new directions of systems research, advocate innovative approaches to long-standing problems, or report on deep insights gained from experience with real-world systems. We seek early-stage work where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry that results in multiple conference papers by different authors in related venues, rather than a single follow-on conference paper. The program committee will explicitly favor papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion.  
 HotOS takes a broad view of systems research. This includes operating systems, storage distributed systems, mobile and embedded systems, virtualization, programming languages, networking security, dependability, and manageability, as well as new systems contributions influenced by other fields such as hardware design, training and serving machine learning verification, economics, social organization, and biological or other nontraditional computing systems.  
 Research and position paper submissions must be no longer than 5 pages including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references. Text should be formatted according to ACM's formatting conventions with 10-point font (two columns, 8.5x11-inch paper, 10-point Times Roman or Libertine font on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, 0.75-inch margins, 0.33-inch gutter [column separation]). Paper submissions will be double blind. The title and an abstract should appear on the first page; authors should not. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Pages should be numbered. Figures and tables should not require magnification for viewing; they may contain color, but should be legible when printed or displayed in black and white. Submissions not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Please use the  acmart  style (\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}).   
 HotOS XX will also feature panels and events with the aim of inspiring lively discussion and research direction-setting independent of any specific work. Panels and events may have many formats, from conventional panel discussions to breakouts to games. If you are interested in hosting or proposing an event, please submit a 1-page proposal (using the same format as above) describing topic, format, and length (up to 90 minutes), plus as many pages as necessary for references and supporting letters from planned participants. Unlike papers, panel and event proposals need not be anonymous (i.e., they may be single blind). Proposals will be evaluated based on relevance of topic and potential to engage the audience. We especially encourage panel topics including but not limited to: industry perspectives on systems research; diversity and inclusion in systems research; under-appreciated open source technologies; and hardware trends and their implications for the future of systems research.  
 Research and position papers as well as panel proposals must be received by Thursday January 15 AoE. This is a hard deadline. Papers and proposals should be submitted as PDF files via the web submission form  . Please select your submission type on the form (paper or proposal).   
 Revised versions of all accepted papers will be available online to registered attendees before the workshop. After the workshop, accepted papers will be made available on the workshop site, along with slides of the presentation and in some cases a summary of the discussion.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for any accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has recently committed to collecting ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 HotOS will be an in-person workshop, and we expect at least one author of each accepted paper to present it and participate in the discussion. In extreme cases (in particular, if authors are unable to obtain a visa) we may consider alternatives, but please contact the chairs if you anticipate any problems attending.  
 In order to encourage deeper discussion and interactions, registration for HotOS will be limited. We expect at least two authors per accepted paper will receive invitations to attend if desired. For non-authors, especially students and industry practitioners, there will be a registration process to request an invitation (to be announced closer to the event).  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. ACM, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the  ACM plagiarism policy and procedures  for details. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts is permitted. However, your HotOS submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts.   
 Furthermore, by submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
