 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 SPAWN: Seamless Proximity-Based Authentication by Utilizing the Existent WiFi Environment  
  Abstract   
 Our objective is to create a transparent authentication factor using existing hardware and information already present. Transparent authentication refers to not burdening the user with interaction, and therefore a transparent authentication factor is applicable not only at the beginning of a session but continuously during an authenticated session. We choose to utilize the WiFi environment of a user, as it is ubiquitous in terms of the presence of WiFi signals and user hardware. As we intend our contribution as an addition to stand-alone passwords or existing multifactor-authentication schemes, we decided to build on the concept of separated authentication channels used in state-of-the-art multifactor authentication. To do so, we require two devices. Measuring the WiFi environment from two points enables us to use the proximity of devices as the additional authentication claim. In this work, we demonstrate that it is feasible to use WiFi to identify the proximity of devices. We analyze two scenarios, a semi-densely populated apartment environment and a densely populated office environment in terms of WiFi access points. In the apartment scenario, we show that SPAWN provides at least as much entropy as a traditional password, while not requiring the user to retype a low-entropy token. In the office scenario, this amount of entropy can still be derived in 74% of the measures. By applying private set metrics, we investigate and demonstrate that a device’s proximity can be employed as an authentication factor without compromising privacy.

 MQfilTTr: Strengthening Smart Home Privacy Through MQTT Traffic Manipulation  
  Abstract   
 We present the software design for an easily extendable architecture that prevents leakage of privacy-relevant data in messages sent from smart home environments to external servers outside of a smart home. Such problems arise since users are mostly unable to control which data leaves the local network unfiltered. We address this situation by a privacy-enforcing hub architecture located at the smart home gateway; our approach enables manipulation of e.g. MQTT messages in order to block or rewrite data before it leaves the smart home. We exemplify our architecture for information dissemination control using MQTT, since it is a well-established and frequently used communication protocol in Internet of Things applications. Our performance analysis demonstrates a comparably low overhead that can easily be tolerated. We also discuss how brown field (e.g. existing) devices can be integrated into such an approach which also highlights our extension of modeling the network protocol’s sender and receiver functions separately facilitating Node-RED; moreover we investigate the danger of circumventing such a hub architecture by exploiting metadata side channels; both these issues have not been sufficiently addressed in previous works, which we extend in this work.

 Combining Cryptography and Discrete-Event Systems to Study Sensor and Actuator Cyberattacks  
  Abstract   
 We consider cyber-physical systems equipped with sensors and actuators controlled or monitored by software and communication capabilities. Such use of communication makes sensors and actuators possibly vulnerable to cyberattacks (more briefly: attacks  ). We consider two approaches to study sensor and actuator attacks. The cryptographic  approach is to design each sensor and actuator to be invulnerable to attacks, regardless of the system in which it is deployed. The discrete-event system  (DES)-based approach is to study the detection of sensor and actuator attacks by observing the behavior of the whole system, without adding any mechanism to sensors and actuators to make them invulnerable. In this paper, we introduce and compare the two approaches and suggest an efficient way to combine them. A concrete case study is presented.

 Towards Interconnected Quantum Networks: A Requirements Analysis  
  Abstract   
 Most of nowadays quantum key distribution (QKD) networks rely on trusted nodes. While trusted nodes allow for overcoming range limitations of QKD, their use hinders building interconnected networks as trust in every node has to be granted in such networks. In this paper, we focus on the requirements to enable interconnected QKD networks and sketch a way towards an interconnected multi-vendor/multi-provider QKD research network.

 A Similarity Approach for the Classification of Mitigations in Public Cybersecurity Repositories into NIST-SP 800-53 Catalog  
  Abstract   
 By 2025, it is projected that cybercrimes will escalate to an alarming annual figure of 10.5 trillion USD. To counter this growing threat, cybersecurity repositories such as CVE, CWE, CAPEC, and Mitre Att &ck serve as crucial platforms for the exchange of threat intelligence and mitigations. These repositories play a pivotal role in the prevention of cyber threats. Yet, mitigations in these repositories are manually described by various experts, lacking standardized rules and often failing to reference widely accepted catalogs like NIST SP800-53.   
 To enhance the effectiveness and usability of mitigations within security repositories, this paper proposes an automatic classification method for repository mitigations, categorizing them into NIST SP800-53 classes. This classification relies on similarity approaches and introduces a novel algorithm aimed at refining and optimizing the accuracy of the classification results.

 Top Cyber Threats: The Rise of Ransomware  
  Abstract   
 Ransomware stands out as a particularly malicious type of cyberattack, wielding the potential to inflict severe financial, operational, and reputational harm. The insidious nature of ransomware, with their ability to encrypt or exfiltrate sensitive data, demands a paradigm shift in cybersecurity strategies. Further, the ability to predict and forecast such malware is paramount for bolstering overall cybersecurity resilience. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of ransomware, detailing key characteristics and specifications of zero-day ransomware, along with limitations in static and dynamic analyses, with the goal of identifying effective defense strategies. Despite substantial advancements, enduring challenges and notable research gaps persist, necessitating ongoing innovation in cybersecurity. Furthermore, this study serves as a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals and researchers, shedding light on key trends, challenges, limitations, and potential avenues for future research in the realm of ransomware forecasting.

 Enhancing Security in Blockchain Enabled IoT Networks Empowered with zk-SNARKs and Physically Unclonable Functions  
  Abstract   
 In the realm of IoT and blockchain, security and privacy are paramount. This paper explores the fusion of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to bolster the security of blockchain-enabled IoT networks.   
 By harnessing zk-SNARKs’ ability to prove knowledge without revealing sensitive information and PUFs’ unique device-based identity verification, we establish a robust framework for data protection and device authentication. We investigate the practical integration of these technologies into IoT ecosystems, addressing challenges and assessing their impact on scalability, efficiency, and security.   
 The research showcases a novel solution for enhancing data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity within IoT networks while empowering devices to prove their identity without disclosing sensitive data. The proposed novel method has a behemoth advantage over conventional data breaches as PUF values are not in transit. It could also help in reducing memory usage and easy scalability. However, it may introduce risks like integration complexity and therefore it is expected to stay updated with evolving cryptographic standards.

 Security Challenges and Countermeasures in Blockchain’s Peer-to-Peer Architecture  
  Abstract   
 This paper addresses the issue of security in blockchain systems, with a focus on attacks targeting the peer-to-peer architecture. The peer-to-peer nature of blockchain is fundamental to many of the benefits promised by blockchain applications. We detail various attacks affecting this architecture, including network attacks, eclipse attack, majority attacks, selfish mining attack, block-withholding attacks, and time-jacking attack. This paper provides a significant contribution in three parts: firstly, it offers a comprehensive description of several attacks targeting this architecture. Secondly, it examines the necessary conditions for the effectiveness of these attacks and, thirdly, it presents a qualitative overview of the defense strategies identified in the existing literature to deal with these threats.

 A Bitcoin-Based Digital Identity Model for the Internet of Things  
  Abstract   
 Cybersecurity in the Internet of Things (IoT), at its heart, relies on the digital identity concept to build security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. However, current centralized identity management systems are built around third party identity providers, which raises privacy concerns and presents a single point of failure. In addition, IoT unconventional characteristics such as scalability, heterogeneity and mobility require new identity management systems to operate in distributed and trustless environments. In order to deal with these challenges, we present the Blockchain-based Identity Management System for the Internet of Things. By such, things and people are able to self-manage their identities and authenticate without relying on any third parties.

 Towards a Time-Dependent Approach for User Privacy Expression and Enforcement  
  Abstract   
 Achieving user privacy is a challenging task in the era of ubiquitous internet and mobile applications where users’ data and activities can be tracked days and nights, by the myriads of applications installed on smartphones, watches, TV, and appliances. The need for a practical, easy to use, and most of all expressive tools to express and enforce privacy rules is still insistent nowadays. Even though the law enforces in many regions of the world the user data protection as a legal principle, still mobile apps and web applications and plugins lack of a steady process that allows users to express, validate and verify their privacy rules when they are interacting with a given application. We introduce in this paper a new approach, which combines both non monotonic logics with the Linear temporal logic (LTL) to define and interpret time-constrained logical predicates used to define data sharing functions based on time such as Periodic Blocking, Time prohibition, and Data shelf life. This paper is a first step towards a time-dependent knowledge base system for privacy rule expression and enforcement.

 Privacy Preserving Federated Learning: A Novel Approach for Combining Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption  
  Abstract   
 Ensuring the data security and privacy stands as a prominent concern in the landscape of machine learning. The conventional approach of centralizing training data raises privacy concerns. Federated learning addresses this by avoiding the need to transfer local data when training a global model, opting to share only local model updates. Despite this, the challenge of information leakage persists. Various attempts tried to tackle this issue, but existing solutions lead to a tradeoff between accuracy, privacy and computation time. This is an unevitable challenge. In this paper, we address that challenge by combining differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. This approach allow to add less noise to the data by shuffling to anonymize the data, not only at the client level but also at the parameter level. Hence, it improves the accuracy of the output models while offering strong privacy guarantees. Importantly, our method avoids complex homomorphic operation, thereby mitigating the computational overhead of HE. In this manner, the data remains protected from all participants in the learning process. Our findings demonstrate that, for an equivalent level of privacy, our method introduces less noise compared to the local DP method, resulting in increased accuracy after aggregation. However, the privacy amplification requires a substantial number of clients, which make our approach more suitable for cross-device Federated learning.

 Distributed Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Generated by DynamicTriggers  
  Abstract   
 The emergence of federated learning has alleviated the dual challenges of data silos and data privacy and security in machine learning. However, this distributed learning approach makes it more susceptible to backdoor attacks, where malicious participants can conduct adversarial attacks by injecting backdoor triggers into their local training datasets, aiming to manipulate model predictions, for example, make the classifier recognize poisoned samples (injected with specific triggers) as specific images. In order to effectively detect backdoor attacks and protect federated learning systems, we need to know how backdoor attacks are generated and developed. Currently, most backdoor attacks to federated learning use centralized attacks with static triggers, which are easily detectable by current defense methods. In this work, we propose a distributed backdoor attack method that fully leverages the distributed nature of federated learning. It starts by generating unique and independent global dynamic triggers for infected benign samples and then decomposes the global trigger into multiple sub-triggers, embedding them into the training sets of multiple participants. During the training phase, data poisoning is introduced. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this attack method exhibits higher persistence and stealthiness, achieving a significantly higher success rate than standard centralized backdoor attacks. Compared to classical distributed backdoor attack (DBA) methods, it shows noticeable improvements in attack performance.

 Submission Guidelines  

 Link for Submissions  

 Papers can be submitted through CMT: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WSDM2025   

 Originality of Submissions  

 Submissions must represent new and original work. Concurrent submissions are not allowed. Papers that have been published in or accepted to any peer-reviewed journal or conference or workshop with published proceedings, or that are currently under review, or that will be submitted to other meetings or publications while under review, may not be submitted to WSDM 2025. However, submissions that are available online (e.g., on a preprint server such as Arxiv) and/or have been previously presented orally or as posters in non peer-reviewed venues with no formal proceedings, are allowed. Additionally, the ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism and self-plagiarism. All prior work must be appropriately cited. Please also see the ACM guide  on the use of Generative AI.  

 Format of Submissions  

 Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in ACM guidelines  (use documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}). Submissions should not exceed eight pages including any diagrams or tables, plus up to two additional pages for references and discussion of ethical considerations. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. After uploading your submission, please verify the copy stored on the submission site. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines, or do not view or print properly, may be rejected without review.  
 PDF files submitted to WSDM 2025 must be anonymized: the submitted document should not include the author information and should not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. Explicitly revealing the manuscript authorship will result in rejection without review. Note, however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the manuscript to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. To this end, instead of stating, for instance, that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. To support faster dissemination of scientific results, we allow submissions that had earlier versions or code posted on preprint servers such as Arxiv.org or GitHub (with the understanding that these materials cannot be anonymous). In such cases, authors should exercise extra care and should not explicitly associate their submission with such publicly posted materials.  

 Supplementary Material  

 Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed in .zip format) containing full theoretical proofs and derivations, detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets, or pointers to external repositories with datasets or source code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers, in other words, the paper should be self-contained as much as possible. In CMT, the option to add supplementary material will appear only after the main paper has been submitted.  

 Reproducibility  

 The resources and methods used within a manuscript should be described as completely as possible, in other words, the submitted 8+2 pages paper should be as self-contained as possible. Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed) containing detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets or pointers to external repositories with datasets or code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. The additional content may or may not be considered when evaluating the manuscript, at the discretion of the reviewers. Wherever appropriate, the authors are encouraged to use publicly available test collections and state-of-the-art baselines, and are encouraged to share the experimental results, data, and code with the research community.  

 Authorship  

 Submitted manuscripts must adhere to the ACM authorship policy  . In particular, (i) each author must be the creator or originator of an idea in the work; (ii) each author must make substantial contributions to the work; and (iii) each author must be accountable for the work that was done and its presentation in a publication. The policy was recently updated to govern the use of generative AI tools in authoring papers.  
 If one submits numerous manuscripts to the same conference, it is less likely that one has materially contributed to all such submissions. To this end, we limit the number of submissions per author to 10 maximum. If more than 10 manuscripts are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional manuscripts submitted after the initial 10, will be rejected without review.  
 Only in exceptional cases will the PC Chairs grant permission for modifications to be made to the author list of a paper once it has been submitted and accepted.  

 Review Process  

 Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least three PC members and a senior PC member. The acceptance decisions will take into account manuscript novelty, technical depth, elegance, practical or theoretical impact, and presentation. WSDM 2025 will use a combination of single-blind reviewing and double-blind reviewing. The manuscripts will be double-blind to regular PC members, but the metadata (including authorship) of the manuscripts will be available to SPC to check for undisclosed conflicts of interest and to help assure the integrity of the review process.  

 ACM Instructions for Authors  

 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID IDs are required for all authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

 Ethical Considerations  

 Submitted manuscripts should include a section on the ethical implications of the proposed research. This section will not be counted in the eight-page limit, and it should appear in the two additional pages together with the references. In this section, authors are asked to reflect and discuss the potential negative societal impact of their work, as they consider appropriate. Examples of negative societal impact include fairness considerations, privacy considerations security considerations, safety considerations, misuse of the technology by malicious actors, as well as possible harms that could arise even when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly. If there are negative societal impacts, authors should discuss appropriate mitigation strategies.  

 Acceptance  

 In case of acceptance, at least one of the authors for the paper must register for the conference. WSDM 2025 will be an in-person conference, with no provisions for remote presentations. If authors are unable to present their work for any reason, they are expected to find a proxy to present the work on their behalf. The organizers reserve the right to remove any paper that is not presented during the conference from the proceedings.  

 Best Papers from WSDM 2025  

 The 10 best papers considered by The WSDM 2025 Best Paper Award Committee will be considered to be published in TIST (ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems). The guest editors consist of the best paper award committee chair and the 3 PC chairs.  

 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  

 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in CMT. You must declare a reviewer/author as a conflict of interest when the following associations exist:  
 employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months 
  candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  received an honorarium, stipend, or grant from the institution or company within the last 12 months (except where of a modest nature, such as reimbursement of seminar expenses, honorarium for examination of a thesis, and so on). 
  co-author on book or paper in the last 24 months 
  co-principal investigator on a funded grant or research proposal in the last 24 months 
  actively working on any project together 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 
  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.  

 Violations of Originality, Dual Submission or Conflicts of Interest  

 Submitted manuscripts that do not meet the length, formatting or originality requirements, or are concurrently submitted to two venues (including manuscripts with significant overlap), are subject to desk rejection without review. At the discretion of the PC Chairs and the Steering Committee, egregious violations (including plagiarism) may lead to additional penalties such as a temporary or permanent ban from the venue and sponsoring SIGs venues, as well as an escalation to the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics (COPE). Likewise, failure of an author to disclose all COIs, or cases of a referee providing a review on a paper for which they have an undisclosed COI, may lead to similar penalties. You are encouraged to contact the PC Chairs if you have questions as to the originality conditions, dual submission, or conflict of interest policy.  

 Submission  

 Submissions to WSDM2025 are now open via CMT  . Authors are invited to submit their abstracts by August 7 and full papers by August 14.

 Submission Guidelines  

 Link for Submissions  

 Papers can be submitted through CMT: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WSDM2025   

 Originality of Submissions  

 Submissions must represent new and original work. Concurrent submissions are not allowed. Papers that have been published in or accepted to any peer-reviewed journal or conference or workshop with published proceedings, or that are currently under review, or that will be submitted to other meetings or publications while under review, may not be submitted to WSDM 2025. However, submissions that are available online (e.g., on a preprint server such as Arxiv) and/or have been previously presented orally or as posters in non peer-reviewed venues with no formal proceedings, are allowed. Additionally, the ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism and self-plagiarism. All prior work must be appropriately cited. Please also see the ACM guide  on the use of Generative AI.  

 Format of Submissions  

 Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in ACM guidelines  (use documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}). Submissions should not exceed eight pages including any diagrams or tables, plus up to two additional pages for references and discussion of ethical considerations. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. After uploading your submission, please verify the copy stored on the submission site. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines, or do not view or print properly, may be rejected without review.  
 PDF files submitted to WSDM 2025 must be anonymized: the submitted document should not include the author information and should not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. Explicitly revealing the manuscript authorship will result in rejection without review. Note, however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the manuscript to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. To this end, instead of stating, for instance, that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. To support faster dissemination of scientific results, we allow submissions that had earlier versions or code posted on preprint servers such as Arxiv.org or GitHub (with the understanding that these materials cannot be anonymous). In such cases, authors should exercise extra care and should not explicitly associate their submission with such publicly posted materials.  

 Supplementary Material  

 Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed in .zip format) containing full theoretical proofs and derivations, detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets, or pointers to external repositories with datasets or source code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers, in other words, the paper should be self-contained as much as possible. In CMT, the option to add supplementary material will appear only after the main paper has been submitted.  

 Reproducibility  

 The resources and methods used within a manuscript should be described as completely as possible, in other words, the submitted 8+2 pages paper should be as self-contained as possible. Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed) containing detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets or pointers to external repositories with datasets or code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. The additional content may or may not be considered when evaluating the manuscript, at the discretion of the reviewers. Wherever appropriate, the authors are encouraged to use publicly available test collections and state-of-the-art baselines, and are encouraged to share the experimental results, data, and code with the research community.  

 Authorship  

 Submitted manuscripts must adhere to the ACM authorship policy  . In particular, (i) each author must be the creator or originator of an idea in the work; (ii) each author must make substantial contributions to the work; and (iii) each author must be accountable for the work that was done and its presentation in a publication. The policy was recently updated to govern the use of generative AI tools in authoring papers.  
 If one submits numerous manuscripts to the same conference, it is less likely that one has materially contributed to all such submissions. To this end, we limit the number of submissions per author to 10 maximum. If more than 10 manuscripts are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional manuscripts submitted after the initial 10, will be rejected without review.  
 Only in exceptional cases will the PC Chairs grant permission for modifications to be made to the author list of a paper once it has been submitted and accepted.  

 Review Process  

 Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least three PC members and a senior PC member. The acceptance decisions will take into account manuscript novelty, technical depth, elegance, practical or theoretical impact, and presentation. WSDM 2025 will use a combination of single-blind reviewing and double-blind reviewing. The manuscripts will be double-blind to regular PC members, but the metadata (including authorship) of the manuscripts will be available to SPC to check for undisclosed conflicts of interest and to help assure the integrity of the review process.

 Short paper:   Ongoing works with relevant preliminary results, open to discussion. These papers are assigned a 8-page limit.  
 Poster paper:   Initial work with relevant ideas, open to discussion. These papers are assigned to a 4-page limit.  
 Company paper:   Companies' papers that show practical experience, R & D, tools, etc., focused on some topics of the conference. These papers are assigned to a 8-page limit.  
 Submitted papers must comply with the format of Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series (see Instructions for Authors at Springer Website)  , be written in English, must not have been published before, not be under review for any other conference or publication and not include any information leading to the authors’ identification. Therefore, the authors’ names, affiliations and bibliographic references should not be included in the version for evaluation by the Program Committee. This information should only be included in the camera-ready version, saved in Word or Latex format and also in PDF format. These files  must  be accompanied by the Consent to Publish form   filled out,   in a ZIP file, and uploaded at the conference management system.   
     
 All papers will be subjected to a “double-blind review” by at least two members of the Program Committee.  
 Based on Program Committee evaluation, a paper can be rejected or accepted by the Conference Chairs. In the later case, it can be accepted as the type originally submitted or as another type. Thus, full papers can be accepted as short papers or poster papers only. Similarly, short papers can be accepted as poster papers only.  
 Poster papers and Company papers are not published in the Conference Proceedings, being only presented and discussed. The authors of accepted poster papers should build and print a poster to be exhibited during the Conference. This poster must follow an A1 or A2 vertical format. The Conference includes Work Sessions where these posters are presented and orally discussed, with a 7 minute limit per poster.  
 The authors of accepted Full papers will have 15 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 5 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation. The authors of accepted Short papers and Company papers will have 11 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 4 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation.  
  
 Publication and Indexing   
 To ensure that a full paper or short paper is published and presented, poster paper or company paper is presented, at least one of the authors must be fully registered by the 15 th  of January 2025, and the paper must comply with the suggested layout and page-limit. Additionally, all recommended changes must be addressed by the authors before they submit the camera-ready version.  
 No more than one paper per registration will be published. An extra fee must be paid for publication of additional papers, with a maximum of one additional paper per registration. One registration permits only the participation of one author in the conference.  
 Full and Short papers will be published in Proceedings by Springer, in several books of of the Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series  . Poster and company papers will not be published, just presented in the conference.  
 Published Full and Short papers will be submitted for indexation by WoS, SCOPUS, DBLP and Google Scholar, among others, and will be available in the SpringerLink Digital Library.  
 The authors of the best selected papers will be invited to extend them for publication in international journals indexed by WoS/SCI, SCOPUS and DBLP, among others, such as:

 Since the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989, The Web Conference (formerly known as the International World Wide Web Conference, abbreviated as WWW) is a yearly international academic conference on the topic of the future direction of the World Wide Web. This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003, and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web.   

 The 2025 ACM Web Conference will offer a high-quality program made of research sessions, posters, and demonstrations, a PhD symposium for the junior scholars, workshops, tutorials, a developers track for the practitioners as well as thought-provoking keynote speakers, panels, special tracks, and colocated special days.   

 The 2025 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with rich virtual components including live streaming of keynotes, oral presentations, workshops, and tutorials, as well as access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees.   

 We thank you for participating and look forward to seeing you in Sydney, Australia!

 Workshop Day  

 All deadlines are 11:59 pm anywhere on earth.  
  *Organizers to decide, but no later than the respective date.  

 WSDM (pronounced “wisdom”) is one of the premier conferences on web-inspired research involving search and data mining. The 18th ACM International WSDM Conference will take place in Hannover, Germany (in-person conference with virtual elements) on March 10-14, 2025.  
 The WSDM 2025 organizing committee invites proposals for full-day and half-day workshops to be held at the WSDM conference on March 14, 2025. The topics of the proposed workshops should be aligned with those set forth in the call for papers of the main conference.  
 WSDM workshops provide a venue for exploring and discussing emerging research directions and applications. The format and content of each workshop will be determined by its organizers. The tasks of the workshop organizers are as follows:  
 Determine the submission deadline for the workshop (if applicable). 
  Handle the full reviewing process, including recruiting the Program Committee. 
  Prepare a workshop website featuring the final program and proceedings. 
  Publicize the workshop in the relevant communities. 
  Prepare workshop notes to be distributed (possibly online) to attendees. 
  Submit a workshop summary paper as part of the proceedings. 
  At least two members of the organizers register and attend the workshop, and supervise the workshop operations. At least one organizer commits to register and attend in person. 
  Plan for an in-person experience, while still allowing virtual participation by those who genuinely face significant challenges. 

 Proposal Format  

 Workshop proposals, in no more than 5 pages (ACM formatting, sigconf style, submitted as PDF), should include the following information:  
 Proposed workshop organizers (names, affiliations and email addresses; identify one person as the primary contact person). 
  Description of the workshop: objectives, goals, relevance to WSDM, and expected outcomes. 
  Rationale for holding such a workshop during WSDM. Description of target audience and estimated number of participants. 
  Proposed workshop duration (1/2 or full day), format, activities, and schedule. 
  Describe how the organizers intend to encourage physical attendance and in-person activities. 
  List of related workshops in recent Web-related conferences, indicating the differences between the past and the proposed workshop. 
  Short biographical sketch for each organizer, describing relevant experience and qualifications (e.g., previous workshop organizing). 
  If this is a recurring workshop (at WSDM or related conferences such as WWW, SIGIR or KDD), the organizers should highlight the fact, and describe past attendance and outcomes. 
  After workshop acceptance, but before the actual workshop date (TBA), the workshop organizers will be asked for a 2-page workshop summary to be included with the conference proceedings*.  
 *Note that the workshop papers are non-archival (i.e., they will not appear in the conference proceedings). However, workshop organizers are free to make independent publication arrangements, e.g., as a special issue in a journal.  
 For any questions, please reach out to wsdm2025@L3S.de

  Call For Papers   
   
 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW IEEE WoWMoM 2025 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances in the areas of wireless, mobile, and multimedia networking as well as ubiquitous and pervasive systems and applications. Wireless networking technologies are continuously evolving and have become a critical part of modern life, be it for communication services, media distribution, or sensing and actuation services within the Internet of Things (IoT). Appropriate resource management, application design, and architectural networking paradigms are necessary to provide users with high quality experience in multimedia communication and services. Edge computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming essential tools to cope with the increasing diversity of connected devices and the plethora of new data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. At the same time, the interoperability among IoT environments (including wearable computing and sensors), the network edge, and the cloud are evolving towards an IoT-edge-cloud continuum that is expected to support a wide range of application domains and services in a seamless and efficient manner. In this context, providing rich sets of measurements for characterizing and understanding the behavior of such complex systems is of paramount importance. IEEE WoWMoM 2025 takes a broad view and seeks papers describing innovative research contributions to the field of mobile and wireless networking and applications. We solicit papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. We also welcome practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments.

 CALL FOR PAPERS    
 We invite contributions to the research tracks of The Web Conference 2025 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place in Sydney, Australia, from 28 April to 02 May 2025.  
    
 The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of computer science, computational social science, economics, policy, and many other disciplines.   

 Important Dates:    
  
 Abstract: October 7, 2024 
  Full paper: October 14, 2024 
  Author and reviewer discussion: December 3-14, 2024 
  Notification: January 20, 2025 
  Camera-ready: February 2, 2025 
   
 All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)   time zone.   

 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE  : The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   

 Submission Site:    
 We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile, properly attributed with current and past institutional affiliation, homepage, Google Scholar, DBLP, ORCID, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar (wherever applicable). Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.   

 Abstracts and papers can be submitted through the OpenReview link: https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2025/Conference&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)     

 Scope:    
 The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially enabled new research and applications. While the Web feeds on and is part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and many others, it remains a distinct scholarly field, with its own research methods, tools, and challenges. A typical Web Conference paper should have an explicit focus on at least one of the following:   
  
 understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a technical infrastructure; including core Web technologies, standards, and platforms 
  understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a socio-economic system; 
  understanding better the impact of the Web and Web technologies; 
  democratizing access to Web content and technologies, making it more accessible, fair, inclusive, and accountable to a wide range of audiences 
   
 Relevance  . Every submission must clearly state how the work is relevant to the Web and to the track in the first  page. Submissions that merely use a Web artifact---e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network---rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope and will be desk-rejected.   

 Tracks  . Our research interests are organized in the following tracks:   

 Economics, online markets and human computation     The Web has served as a platform for large-scale online markets such as cloud computing, crowdsourcing, and the sharing economy. This growth highlights the importance of understanding the economics of the Web, and we welcome innovative research in this space. The new wave of AI applications introduce new perspectives with respect to economics, markets, and training data sets. This track is a forum for theoretical, empirical, and applied research related to the modeling, analysis, and design of Web-related economic activities, online markets, and human computation.

 Submission Guidelines    
 Deadlines.  The submission deadlines are strict  and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder/dummy abstracts are forbidden.   

 Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools. Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper.   
  
 Maximum authorship. | The number of submissions allowed per author is limited to 7 (seven) maximum, accumulatively across the research tracks. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission ID, | will be desk-rejected after the full paper submission deadline | . 
  Authorship changes. | The full list of authors, including the ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the abstract submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliations. 

 Authorship means accountability for the work. As such, Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) cannot be considered authors. You can use LLMs to rephrase your text, but you are solely responsible for the text in the paper.   

 Every author of a submission should have an OpenReview account with accurate personal information (i.e., correct first name and last name, and a valid preferred email address). Otherwise, the submission will be desk-rejected.   

 Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to identify your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.   

 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf). Word users may use the Word Interim Template and the recommended setting for LaTeX is:   

 \documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}.    

 Submissions must be a single PDF file: 8  (eight) pages as main paper, with unlimited pages for references and an optional Appendix (that can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc). The first 8 pages should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read past that.   

 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work---this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference / journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.   

 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.   

 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. If your work has been reviewed by an IRB, please indicate this in the paper, providing approval numbers where appropriate. Failure to comply with the above-mentioned policy on Human Participants and Subjects will lead to a rejection of the paper.   

 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.     

 Reviewing Process    
 Reviewing  . Each paper is submitted to one of the tracks listed above. Papers that do not conform to the conference scope or submission guidelines will be desk-rejected by the track chair (aka Senior Area Chair, SAC). Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track and the process overseen by an Area Chair (AC).   

 For each submitted paper, authors will be requested to select one of the authors to serve as reviewer. If all authors of a paper decide to reject invitations to serve as reviewers or accept to review but fail to complete their duties as reviewers, the paper will be desk rejected.   

 Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to the reviews during an author-reviewer discussion period. The ACs and SACs will consider the authors' responses to the points raised by the reviewers to inform acceptance decisions.   

 Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs and SACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.   

 Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to The Web Conference 2025, the authors agree that the reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.   

 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy    
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. You must declare a domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. You must declare a personal conflict  when the following associations exist:   
  
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
  active collaborator 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 

 In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM's Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .   

 Publication and Presentation Policies    
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings (12 pages, of which 8 are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. In addition, all papers are required to submit a brief pre-recorded video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF of the papers.   

 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.   

 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings. There will be two forms of presentation:   

 Oral Presentation. Among the accepted papers, a subset will be selected for oral presentation. Generally we expect oral presentations to be in-person, but may allow a few online presentations by authors with significant travel difficulties. 
  Poster Presentation. All papers will be asked to produce a poster on-site. An e-copy will appear on Whova. To facilitate authors in getting their hard-copy posters on-site, the conference offers a local poster printing service for a fee, which you may access at this link (to be provided). Organizer will bring the posters on-site. 

 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the "Artifacts Available" badge in ACM's Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.

  CALL FOR PAPERS  
  
 IMPORTANT NOTE  
 WoWMoM 2024 will adopt a double-blind review process. Refer to the details under Paper Submission for the requirements to double-blind submissions.  
 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2024 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances in the areas of wireless, mobile, and multimedia networking as well as ubiquitous and pervasive systems and applications. Wireless networking technologies are continuously evolving and have become a critical part of modern life, be it for communication services, media distribution, or sensing and actuation services within the Internet of Things (IoT). Appropriate resource management, application design, and architectural networking paradigms are necessary to provide users with high quality experience in multimedia communication and services. Edge computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming essential tools to cope with the increasing diversity of connected devices and the plethora of new data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. At the same time, the interoperability among IoT environments (including wearable computing and sensors), the network edge, and the cloud are evolving towards an IoT-edge-cloud continuum that is expected to support a wide range of application domains and services in a seamless and efficient manner. In this context, providing rich sets of measurements for characterizing and understanding the behavior of such complex systems is of paramount importance.  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2024 takes a broad view and seeks papers describing innovative research contributions to the field of mobile and wireless networking and applications. We solicit papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. We also welcome practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments.

 PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION  
 Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, previously unpublished work not currently under review by another conference, workshop, or journal. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Specifically, the authors should not identify themselves in any content within the paper either directly or indirectly (e.g., through references). Where relevant, authors must refer to their previous work in the third person write as if it was written by a third party. However, authors should ensure that any anonymization of their work is not destructive. For instance, omission of references to papers just because they are the authors' previous work should be avoided, as this could prevent reviewers from finding that related paper for the purpose of the review. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review.  
 Although submission is double-blind, non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to the rejection of your paper. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints before completing a first read of your paper, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be made electronically through EDAS. Click here  to register your paper now!  
 Authors can submit regular or work-in-progress papers (appropriate category to be selected upon submission).  
  
 REGULAR PAPERS  
 Regular papers submissions may be up to 10 pages in length (including figures and references), formatted in two-column IEEE conference style with font size 10 points or greater. See IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings.   
 WORK IN PROGRESS PAPERS  
 WIP (Work-in-progress) papers provide a peer-reviewed forum for late-breaking or preliminary research results, giving an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present and demonstrate their recent research and obtain feedback from their peers in a poster session. Work-in-progress papers submissions may be up to 4 pages in length (including figures and references) and must have the prefix "WIP:" in the paper's title.  
 IMPORTANT DATES:  
 Papers due: | December 1, 2023 | December 17, 2023 
  Acceptance notification: February 19, 2024 
  Camera-ready version due: April 14, 2024 
  ACCEPTED PAPERS  
 An author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate. The paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference. Exceptions can be granted if compelling reasons are sent to the TPC Co-Chairs with a written request indicating an adequate substitute presenter before the conference. Accepted papers (both regular and WIP) will be included in the proceedings of IEEE WoWMoM 2024 which will be published through the IEEE Xplore digital library.  
 All conference proceedings must meet IEEE's quality standards, and IEEE reserves the right not to publish any proceedings that do not meet these standards. Furthermore, IEEE reserves the right to remove papers from IEEE Xplore that are not presented at the conference, for unjustified reasons.  
 BEST PAPER AWARD  
 All accepted regular papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award. A committee will select three best paper candidates based on the reviews received and also the quality of presentation. The winner will be announced during the conference. For any additional information, please contact the PC Co-chairs.

  About     The Web Conference 
  Code of Conduct 

 Call for Industry Track    
 We invite contributions to the Industry Track for Applied Research of The Web Conference 2025 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place in Sydney, Australia, from April 28 (Monday) to May 2 (Friday), 2025.   

 The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of different disciplines, including big data, AI, computing, computational social science, economics and political sciences.   

 The realm of the Internet has demonstrated its remarkable potential as a rich domain for industrial exploration. Enterprises spanning the spectrum from modest startups to industry giants, regardless of their age, have consistently influenced the forefront of scientific and engineering advancements. In the Industry Track of The Web Conference 2025, we aim to spotlight this kind of impactful research conducted within practical contexts. We also wholeheartedly welcome submissions that delve into new technological progress, including but not limited to the application of Generative AI, across diverse industrial landscapes.   

 The Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work  describing e.g., the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released  , and for how long.   

 Each submission must include at least one author with a non-academic  affiliation.

 All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)   time zone.   

 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE  : The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   

 Submission Guidelines    
 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be written in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format   (also available   in Overleaf). Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:   

 \documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}.     

 Submissions must be a single PDF file: 4  ( four  ) to 8  ( eight  ) pages as main paper, with up to 2 additional pages for references and optional appendix.   

 Submission Site  . Submissions must be made through the EasyChair system at https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=www25companion   (select WWW25 - Industry track).   

 Authorship  . Submissions are not  anonymous, hence authors should list their names and affiliations.   

 Reviewing  . Submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the Industry Committee based on originality, significance, quality, and clarity. The review process will be single-blind.   

 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work---this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification   that applies to all publications.   

 Publication and Presentation Policies    
 Publication  . Each accepted paper will be included in the Companion  Proceedings of the Web Conference 2025. In addition, each paper is required to submit a brief pre-recorded video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF.   
 Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   
   
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct  conference registration, e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day), at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.   

 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings. There will be two forms of presentation:   
  
 Oral Presentation | . Among the accepted papers, a subset will be selected for oral presentation. Generally we expect oral presentations to be in-person, but may allow a few online presentations by authors with significant travel difficulties.

24. Conference WWW_3:
History of TheWebConf series  
 The World Wide Web  was first conceived in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee   at CERN   in Geneva, Switzerland. The first conference of the series, WWW1  , was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau   .  
  The International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)  was founded by Joseph Hardin  and Robert Cailliau  later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW  became an annual event held in April or May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11  became known as WWW2002  , and so on.   
 Starting in 2018, The brand of the conference has been changed and the series is now named The Web Conference  or in brief TheWebConf  and starting in 2022, the conference became an ACM/SIGWEB  event and the rotation between the three geographical areas is no longer the rule.   
 In 2022 the IW3C2   adopted new by-laws and it is no longer involved in the organization of the TheWebConf. Its new mission is to manage funds from gifts or donations to grant awards for publications presented during these conferences.   
  IW3C2  continues to maintain archives of all past conferences web sites.

 26th International Conference on Agile Software Development  
   
 XP 2025 • Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland • June 2-5, 2025   
  We welcome the XP community for the first time in Switzerland  !   
 XP is the premier agile software development conference, that combines, both, research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results. At its inception, 26 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern agile approaches and all the developing aspects of agility. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.  
 What matters to you?   
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success.  
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient?  
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem?  
  Call for Submissions   
 For XP 2025, we are interested in talks and papers, especially those on this year’s theme:  
 Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products     
 To find out more about a particular track and to enter a submission, please click on the relevant track in the tracks menu. Each track page includes a list of deadlines, guidelines, requirements, and other submission information.  
 Stay tuned and see you in Switzerland!

 26th International Conference on Agile Software Development  
   
 XP 2025 • Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland • June 2-5, 2025   
  We welcome the XP community for the first time in Switzerland  !   
 XP is the premier agile software development conference, that combines, both, research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results. At its inception, 26 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern agile approaches and all the developing aspects of agility. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.  
 What matters to you?   
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success.  
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient?  
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem?  
  Call for Submissions   
 For XP 2025, we are interested in talks and papers, especially those on this year’s theme:  
 Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products     
 To find out more about a particular track and to enter a submission, please click on the relevant track in the tracks menu. Each track page includes a list of deadlines, guidelines, requirements, and other submission information.  
 Stay tuned and see you in Switzerland!
