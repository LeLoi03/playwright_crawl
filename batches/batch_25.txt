 About 
  Program 
  Welcome to the website of the 17th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming (FLOPS 2024). FLOPS 2024 is co-sponsored by Special Interest Group on Programming and Programming Languages (SIG-PPL)  , Japan Society for Software Science and Technology (JSSST)  , in cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN  .  
 The FLOPS 2024 proceedings  are now available online (free to read and download until end of June 2024).  
 About FLOPS   
 FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.  
 Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo  (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara  (2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise  (2008), Sendai  (2010), Kobe  (2012), Kanazawa  (2014), Kochi  (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita  online  (2020), and Kyoto  online  (2022).

 Call for Papers  
  
 FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:  
 functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems, formal methods and model checking, program transformations and program refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem provers or SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative programming techniques; 
  foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and case studies. 
  FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.  
 Submission   
 Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:  
 Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be judged on originality, correctness, and significance. 
  System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design. 
  Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories with illustrative applications. 
  System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as such in the title.  
 Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must follow Springer’s Code of Conduct  . See also the ACM SIGPLAN Republication Policy  . At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to attend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no general facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will do our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable obstacles).  
 Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer’s guidelines  . Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to an anonymized web page or an appendix, which does not count towards the page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose not to look at it when writing their review.  
 Papers should be submitted electronically at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024  .  
 Reviewing process   
 FLOPS 2024 will employ a light double-blind  reviewing process; reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and 
  references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  
 Publication   
 The proceedings will be published by Springer International Publishing in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series  .  
   
 We expect to invite the authors of four to seven of the best papers to submit an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming (SCP)  .  
 Important dates   
 All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).  
 Abstract due: Wed 6th Dec 2023 
  Submission deadline: Wed 13th Dec 2023

 Post  

 International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming aims to bring together practitioners, researchers, and implementors of the declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.

 Does every Computer Scientist need to know Formal Methods?  
   2024-10-02  ·   
  curricula  · fme teaching committee  · fmtea    

 FME’s Teaching Committee  has recently organised a special issue of Formal Aspects of Computing  that puts forward different perspectives on why and how Formal Methods should be represented in Computer Science curricula. The discussion was triggered by the guidelines that ACM has been publishing for computer technology university curricula for more than five decades  .

 Book Review: Understanding Programming Languages  
   2024-10-01  ·   
  book reviews  · news  · brc    

 Cliff B. Jones: Understanding Programming Languages   
 Springer, November 2020, 229 pp, ISBN: 978-3-030-59256-1. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59257-8   
 Summary  
 The book Understanding Programming Languages  by Cliff B. Jones is about the formal specification of the semantics of programming languages. It focuses on the structural operational semantics of imperative and sequential languages, including features such as blocks and procedures, with an extension to concurrent objects at the end of the book. The material is presented with great clarity and requires almost no background knowledge, making the book perfectly suitable for any person curious about programming languages and seeking a deeper understanding of how they work. This book is also for language designers, as being formally precise is an invaluable tool to help catch design issues early in the design phase.

 Call for Proposals  
  FM 2026: 27th International Symposium on Formal Methods  
  Spring 2026  
  This call is also available as a pdf  .  
 Formal Methods Europe ( FME  ) is a worldwide association bringing together researchers and practitioners in formal methods for developing computing systems and software. We aim to encourage both research and application by disseminating research findings and industrial experience through symposia and sponsored events.  
 FME organises a symposium on Formal Methods every 18 months approximately, attracting participants from all over the world. The 25th symposium  took place in Lübeck (Germany), March 2023, while the 26th symposium  will be in Milan (Italy), September 2024.  
 FME is now inviting proposals from any group or institution wishing to host the 27th International Symposium on Formal Methods  , which is to be held in Spring 2026  (preferably outside Europe, since FM 2023 was and FM 2024 is going to be in Europe).  
 The co-location of the FM symposium with other conferences and workshops in related areas is very much welcomed and much appreciated by the community, hence ideas for such a co-location may be part of the proposal. The format of the symposium foresees the organisation of related events such as tutorials, displays of tools, products research projects and publishers. The FME board may also ask you to consider co-location of events that approach FME.  
 Important Dates and Information  
 April 30, 2024: | Optional informal notification of interest. 
  June 6, 2024: | Symposium proposals due. | After submission proposers need to be available to answer queries from the evaluators. 
  July 10, 2024: | Notification of evaluation results. | Proposals are evaluated by the FME board in consultation with the symposium steering group and other FME members. 
  FME and the successful proposers sign a formal contract. 
  Requirements for Proposals  
 Proposals should be no more than 4 pages in length and should contain:  
 A brief description of why the symposium is of interest to the proposer. 
  Information on the potential involvement of relevant industries located in the area around the venue. 
  The vision for the event, including its aims, the expected format and scale. 
  A description of the relevant qualifications and experience of the proposers, especially regarding conference organisation logistics. 
  A description of the facilities that will be available for the symposium and to support the organisers. 
  The contact information of the proposed organising committee. 
  An informative document called ‘ A Guide to the FM Symposium  ’ is available from FME’s website. In particular, please note that the PC chairs are selected and invited by the FME chair in consultation with the General Chair, the FME Board, former PC chairs and selected colleagues and FME members. Proposers may suggest potential PC chairs but, to avoid embarrassment, must not contact potential PC chairs directly.  
 Submitting your proposal  
 Please send your proposal (in PDF format) or any enquiries to info@fmeurope.org  .

 FM: The Formal Methods Symposia  

 The Formal Methods Symposia  
 FME organizes a symposium roughly every 18 months. Each symposium attracts between 125 and 500 attendees, interested in both theoretical aspects of formal methods as well as the practical application of formal methods, from all over the world.  
 Partnership with Journals  
 FME has established partnerships with several prestigious formal methods journals. Through these partnerships, the FM symposia will include presentations of papers published in the journals in the program of the FM symposia. These presentations compose a Journal-First Track  . A dedicated Track Chair, with the help of a small committee, selects papers from the partnership journals and invite authors to present their work at FM. In this way, FME aims to strenghten the social side of our science, as lively discussion are central to scientific progress.  
 The partner journals that support the Journal-first track are:  
 Formal Aspects of Computing | (ACM) 
  Formal Methods in System Design | (Springer) 
  Science of Computer programming | (Elsevier) 
  Proceedings  
 Proceedings of the FME symposia are published by Springer Verlag as part of the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)  series. DBLP maintains an index of all FME symposia  .  
 FME Subgroup  
 FME has a subgroup dealing with daily matters concerning the symposia and thinking about strategic issues in the longer run.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 About FMCAD  
 FMCAD 2025 is the twenty-fifth in a series of conferences on the theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD covers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including verification, specification, synthesis, and testing.  
 FMCAD was first held in 1996, and was a bi-annual conference until 2006, when the FMCAD and CHARME conferences merged into a single annual conference. Before merging, FMCAD was held in the United States on even years and its sister conference, CHARME, was held in Europe on odd years. Since 2006, the FMCAD conference has been held annually at various international venues.  
 Student Forum  
 Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2025 is hosting a Student Forum  that provides a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  - 
  Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.  
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.  
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025.  
 Area of interest include:  
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
  approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
  formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
  analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
  scalability of formal method applications 
  integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
  model-based engineering approaches; 
  correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
  application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
  formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
  formal methods in a certification context 
  case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
  experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
  guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
  usability of formal methods. 
    
 Call for Papers  
  
 We accept papers in three categories:  
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
  Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
  Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
  All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).  
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.  
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template  , specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year.  
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 use the following HotCRP link  .  
 Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers   
 As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties.  
 PAPER SELECTION   
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity.  
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request.  
 PUBLICATION   
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings.

   1.  ERCIM's oldest active Working Group   
 Following an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques.  
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry.  
 In 2008, issue number 75 of the ERCIM News  hosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry.  
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association.  
  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems.  
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development:  
 requirements specification 
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.  
  3.  Objectives   
 The main objectives of the WG are: To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
  To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
  To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
  The above objectives will be met by means of: Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
  Development projects with industrial partners. 
  Research projects and researchers mobility.

  - 
  Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.  
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.  
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025.  
 Area of interest include:  
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
  approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
  formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
  analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
  scalability of formal method applications 
  integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
  model-based engineering approaches; 
  correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
  application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
  formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
  formal methods in a certification context 
  case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
  experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
  guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
  usability of formal methods. 
    
 Call for Papers  
  
 We accept papers in three categories:  
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
  Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
  Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
  All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).  
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.  
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template  , specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year.  
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 use the following HotCRP link  .  
 Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers   
 As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties.  
 PAPER SELECTION   
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity.  
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request.

  Report of the 29th International Conference on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems 

   Report of the 29th International Conference on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems   
  
 Details   Last Updated: 23 October 2024     
 by Maurice ter Beek (CNR-ISTI)  
 The yearly conference of the ERCIM Working Group on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems, FMICS [L1], the key conference at the intersection of industrial applications and formal methods, reached its 29th edition. This year the participants met in Milan, Italy, during 9-11 September 2024.  
 The aim of the FMICS conference series is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the development and application of formal methods in industry. It strives to promote research and development for improving formal methods and tools for industrial applications.  
 FMICS 2024 [L2] was chaired by Anne Haxthausen (Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby) and Wendelin Serwe (Inria Grenoble, France) and organised by the general chairs Matteo Pradella and Matteo Rossi (Politecnico di Milano, Italy) and their team as a co-located event of FM 2024, the 26th International Symposium on Formal Methods. As part of this co-location, FM and FMICS organised a joint Industry Day on 11 September. This is one of the reasons for which FMICS 2024 overall attracted about 100 participants from many countries worldwide, from academia as well as industry, making this a very well attended edition.  
 The international program committee, with 35 members from 15 different countries, received 22 submissions and decided to accept 14 papers after a rigorous reviewing process. The program moreover included two excellent invited keynote presentations, namely “The Business of Proof” by Byron Cook (Amazon Web Services, UK) and “B+ or how to model system properties in a formal software model” by Thierry Lecomte (Clearsy, France), both of which attracted many participants also from FM and from the other co-located conferences FACS, LOPSTR, PPDP and TAP. ERCIM and Inria generously sponsored the invited speakers (Figure 1).  
   
  Figure 1: FMICS 2024 PC chairs Anne Haxthausen and Wendelin Serwe acknowledged ERCIM sponsoring of the invited speakers during the conference opening presentation.   
 Following a tradition established over the years, Springer sponsored the FMICS best paper awards. This year, the program committee selected the contributions “Safe Linear Encoding of Vehicle Dynamics for the Instantiation of Abstract Scenarios” by Jan Steffen Becker (German Aerospace Center, Oldenburg) as the FMICS 2024 Best Paper (Figure 2) and “Logika: The Sireum Verification Framework” by Robby, John Hatcliff and Jason Belt (Kansas State University, USA) as the FMICS 2024 Best Tool Paper (Figure 3).  
   
  Figure 2: Jan Steffen Becker received the FMICS 2024 Best Paper Award from the PC chairs Anne Haxthausen and Wendelin Serwe.   
   
  Figure 3: John Hatcliff received the FMICS 2024 Best Tool Paper Award from the PC chairs Anne Haxthausen and Wendelin Serwe.   
 FMICS 2025 will take place in Aarhus, Denmark, under the CONFEST 2025 umbrella, alongside CONCUR, FORMATS and QEST, and organised by the general chairs Jaco van de Pol and Andreas Pavlogiannis (University of Aarhus, Denmark) and their team during 25-30 August 25-30.

 Research Ethics in the Digital Age  
 14-15 October 2024  
 HUN-REN SZTAKI - HUN-REN Institute for Computer Science and Control, Budapest, Hungary and online  
    
 Researchers  in digital sciences face tough ethical questions in their daily activity for which there aren't yet consensual answers among the research community. The ERCIM forum "Beyond Compliance" aims at advancing the discussion about those issues. The target audience is composed by researchers and Research Ethics Boards. The event consists of keynotes, presentations, tutorials and interactive sessions, and provides ample time for open discussions. Different outcomes are envisioned, including some which may be directed towards policy makers.

 Reducing the likelihood of faults and failures in the development and in the use of interactive systems becomes a more and more inescapable necessity.: Indeed the use of such systems is becoming widespread in applications that demand high dependability due to usability, safety or, security requirements while taking into account additional considerations such as User Experience or Learnability. Interactive systems make use of more and more sophisticated electronic devices and are made up by multiple hardware and software components. These systems are in fact large artifacts that are also becoming increasingly ubiquitous and being used in new and more complex situations.  
 Consequently, the use of formal methods in providing some assurance on the dependability of interactive systems should take into account the wider socio-technical system. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computer science, human factors, and other areas of HCI, from both academia and industry, who are interested in both formal methods and interactive system design and development.

 Formal Methods Research Group  
 School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow  

 About  
  
  The Formal Methods  research group is part of the FATA section  , School of Computing Science  at the University of Glasgow  .  
 Our research covers a wide range of topics, including process calculi, semantic models and logics, verification techniques based on types and type systems, formulation of model checking algorithms, techniques for efficient and scalable analysis including abstraction and symmetry reduction, and developing game theoretic techniques. A fundamental aspect of our research is the application of formal methods to the modelling  , verification  and synthesis  of complex software systems including autonomous systems such as UAVs, location-aware, event-based systems, communication-based and distributed systems, telecommunications services, biochemical networks and cell signalling, security protocols and safety-critical systems.  
 We are also one of the principal developers of the probabilistic model checker  PRISM  - the most widely-used software tool for verification of probabilistic systems.

 The Non-Uniform Distribution of User’s Calls in Time & Space: heterogeneous wireless networks  
 In heterogeneous network environment integrated multiple radio access technology, the nonuniform distribution of users’ calls in time and space is the important factor affecting the performance of heterogeneous wireless network. In order to improve the performance of heterogeneous wireless network, a novel dynamic load balance scheme based on access selection and calls transfer was proposed. In this paper, access selection was modeled as a constrained optimization problem, the access calls was assigned to all base station evenly in accordance with the optimization result. In addition, in order to weaken the destructiveness of sudden calls from hot area to the system load balance, a calls transfer strategy based on the threshold of base station load rate was given. Experimental result shows that the proposed solution performs better than literature solutions in access blocking rate, calls dropping rate, load balance and system utilization rate, and has the advantage of good application value

21. Conference FOCS_0:
IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) |  

 larger cover image | The IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) is the flagship conference sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing (TCMF)  and covers a broad range of theoretical computer science. It is held annually in the autumn and is paired with its sister conference, the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) held each spring and sponsored by ACM SIGACT. History  
 FOCS was founded in 1960 as the Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design. The 1960 conference did not have a separate published proceedings but most of the papers were published in the second half of the proceedings of the 1961 conference. For the 7th instantiation of the conference in 1966, the name was changed to the Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (SWAT). The greatly increased breadth of the conference led to a name change to its present one in 1975. At that time Alvy Ray Smith  produced the distinctive cover art  that was a notable feature of FOCS proceedings until FOCS ended the production of printed proceedings in 2010. The stylized FOCS fox logo was created for the 26th FOCS. FOCS celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009. |

  The IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) is the flagship conference of the TCMF and covers a broad range of theoretical computer science. It is held annually in the autumn and is paired with its sister conference, the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) held each spring and sponsored by ACM SIGACT.  
  FOCS was founded in 1960 as the Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design. The 1960 conference did not have a separate published proceedings but most of the papers were published in the second half of the proceedings of the 1961 conference. For the 7th instantiation of the conference in 1966, the name was changed to the Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (SWAT). The greatly increased breadth of the conference led to a name change to its present one in 1975. At that time Alvy Ray Smith  produced the distinctive cover art that is a notable feature of FOCS hardcopy proceedings. FOCS celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2019.  
 FOCS 2024 will be held in Chicago, Illinois from October 27-30, 2024; the conference webpage is located at: https://focs.computer.org/2024/  . FOCS 2025 will be held in Sydney, Australia.  
 The FOCS conference archive is located at: http://ieee-focs.org   
 IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)  
  The IEEE Symposium on Logic in computer Science is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to logic broadly construed. It was founded in 1986 and is celebrating its 33rd anniversary. A sampling of the many subjects covered by the LICS conference includes automated deduction, concurrency and distributed computation, constructive mathematics, database theory, finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods, logical aspects of computational complexity, logic in artificial intelligence, logics of programs, model checking, programming language semantics, proof theory, reasoning about security, type systems and type theory, and formal verification.  
 LICS 2024 will be held in Tallinn, Estonia from July 8-11, 2024; the conference webpage is located at: https://focs.computer.org/2024/  .

 FOCS Test of Time Award – Call for Nominations 2024  

 FOCS 2024 Test of Time Awards   

 Call for Nominations   

 The 2024 FOCS Test of Time Awards   , awarded annually, recognize papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. This is the sixth annual award. The target years for the Test of Time Awards in 2024 are for papers presented at the FOCS conferences in 1994, 2004, and 2014. Following new guidance from the FOCS Steering Committee this year, while focusing on the target years, the award committee will consider nominations for exceptional papers in other years. (Please see https://tc.computer.org/tcmf/focs-test-time-award/  for more details, including award winners of previous years.)  

 Nomination Procedure   

 Nominations should be sent by July 31, 2024  to jyc@cs.wisc.edu  with a subject line of “ FOCS TOT nomination  “. Nominations should contain an explanation of the technical achievements and the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. Self-nominations are discouraged.  

 Selection   

 The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the FOCS Steering Committee. For 2024 the award committee consists of Julia Chuzhoy (Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago), Costis Daskalakis (MIT), Faith Ellen (University of Toronto), Shafi Goldwasser (UC Berkeley), Leonard Schulman (Caltech), and committee chair Jin-Yi Cai (UW-Madison). Following FOCS Steering Committee’s guidlines, consideration of papers coauthored by committee members will be deferred to after their service as committee members ends.   
   
 In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including:  
   
 Solving a problem of lasting importance,   
 Pioneering a new area of research,   
 Introducing novel techniques.  
 The committee expects to select one paper for the award from each of the targeted conference years 1994, 2004 and 2014, but may select either more or fewer papers, as well as papers from non-targeted years. The committee may give awards to papers that are not nominated.

 18th ACM/SIGEVO Conference on Foundations of Genetic Algorithms  
 FOGA XVIII, Aug 27 – 29, 2025, Leiden, The Netherlands  
 FOGA 2025 is a conference organized by ACM/SIGEVO and hosted by the Leiden Institute of Computer Science (LIACS) in Leiden, The Netherlands. The conference will this year take place on three days (Wed – Fri)  
   
 Call for Papers  
 The FOGA series aims at advancing our understanding of the working principles behind evolutionary algorithms and related randomized search heuristics, such as local search algorithms, differential evolution, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, simulated annealing, and other Monte Carlo methods for search and optimization. Connections to related areas, such as Bayesian optimization and direct search, are of interest as well. FOGA is the premier event to discuss advances on the theoretical foundations of these algorithms, tools needed to analyze them, and different aspects of comparing algorithms’ performance. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Run time analysis 
  Mathematical tools suitable for the analysis of search heuristics 
  Fitness landscapes and problem difficulty 
  (On- and offline) configuration and selection of algorithms, heuristics, operators, and parameters 
  Stochastic and dynamic environments, noisy evaluations 
  Constrained optimization 
  Problem representation 
  Complexity theory for search heuristics 
  Multi-objective optimization 
  Benchmarking aspects, including performance measures, the selection of meaningful benchmark problems, and statistical aspects 
  Connection between black-box optimization and machine learning 
  Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.

 Satoshi Grace Period  
 On October 4th, 2024, we project that the Ethereum's Beacon Chain will publish a random number in slot 10100000  denoted "RANDAO Reveal". Based on the last (least significant) hex character of this number, we will offer a possible extension to the paper deadline as follows:  
  
 Number | Paper submission deadline 
 0, 1 | 8 October (original deadline) 
 2, 3, 4 | 9 October 
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 October 
 A, B, C, D, E, F | 11 October 
  
 The random number in slot 10100000 is 0x  8  f  b  c  7  9  e  b  7  3  3  d  3  f  e  f  8  d  2  1  8  a  0  9  2  4  b  d  a  4  a  0  f  f  6  7  6  3  1  7  7  9  0  d  c  5  8  c  2  7  8  a  4  6  2  f  7  d  9  c  0  3  a  e  d  1  6  1  8  b  e  4  9  d  f  1  f  d  7  7  e  4  4  f  0  c  8  e  f  2  6  0  e  0  e  a  1  4  c  7  b  d  a  6  7  0  d  0  2  6  2  c  c  4  7  3  a  6  a  8  7  b  6  7  e  b  2  1  d  c  e  f  9  3  e  7  5  d  d  2  9  d  9  8  f  1  c  3  8  7  2  4  3  2  e  9  d  e  5  8  e  2  b  2  0  f  6  0  2  7  9  5  b  a  a  5  5  1  c  0  8  2  c  e  a  4  3  5  d  5  2  e  and the FC25 submission deadline is thus 11 October 2024  .

 Research papers | , | regular papers (15 pages + references and appendices), 
  short papers (8 pages + references; no appendices), and 
  systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (20 pages + references and appendices) 
  Workshop proposals | (2 pages) 
  Tutorial proposals | (2 pages) 
   
 Research paper submissions must be uploaded through the conference submission website  .  
   
 Click here to submit a paper   
 Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  , and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below.  
 General Information  
 For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form  when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.  
 Format  
 Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format ( templates  ) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.  
 Original Submissions  
 Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.  
 Ethics and Etiquette  
 Authors are required to read and follow this information  on ethics and etiquette.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair".  
 Evaluation Criteria  
 Regular Research Papers  
 Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices so the full papers should be intelligible without them.  
 Short Papers  
 Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text "Short Paper:". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text "SoK:".  
 Workshop Proposals  
 Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Workshop proposals should include:  
 Title 
  (Draft) Call for papers 
  Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope 
  (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s) 
  One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates 
  Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  . Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Tutorials  
 Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Tutorial proposals should include:  
 Title 
  Description 
  Name(s) of presenter(s) 
  Brief biographies for all presenters 
  Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s) 
  Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Rump Session  
 The conference will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.

The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

 FOIS 2025  
  
 Definition and scope   
 The FOIS conference is a meeting point for all researchers with an interest in formal ontology. Formal ontology is the systematic study of the types of entities and relations making up the domains of interest represented in modern information systems. The conference encourages submission of high quality, not previously published results on both theoretical issues and practical advancements. FOIS 2025 will have distinct tracks for foundational issues, ontology applications and methods, and domain ontologies.  
 FOIS aims to be a nexus of interdisciplinary research and communication for researchers from many domains engaging with formal ontology. Common application areas include conceptual modeling, database design, knowledge engineering and management, software engineering, organizational modeling, artificial intelligence, robotics, computational linguistics, the life sciences, bioinformatics and scientific research in general, geographic information science, information retrieval, library and information science, as well as the Semantic Web.  
 FOIS is the flagship conference of the International Association for Ontology and its Applications (IAOA  ), which is a non-profit organization promoting interdisciplinary research and international collaboration in formal ontology.

  Only online (not willing or able to present in-person) 
  Acceptance will be either for in-person presentation or for online presentation, at which time authors can no longer change the modality  .  
 Since the numbers of in-person and online presentations are limited, we encourage authors to be as flexible as possible to maximize your chance of paper acceptance. The program chairs will take these preferences in consideration when deciding on the acceptance of the papers..  
 Reviewing Process   
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee and 1 member of the senior program committee, who will provide a meta-review.  
 All reviews will be anonymous.  
 These reviews will then be shared with the authors, who will have the opportunity to rebut criticisms to their papers that are factually  incorrect  . Rebuttals should not be used to answer reviewers criticisms, justify methodological decisions, or promise improvements to the submission.  
 Rebuttals will be at most 300 words long.  
 With the rebuttals, the senior program committee members will be allowed to amend their meta-reviews, if necessary, and make a recommendation on whether the paper should be accepted or rejected.  
 A final decision will then be made by the program committee chairs.  
 Accepted papers will then have the FAIRness of their related artifacts evaluated (if applicable). If an artifact is not FAIR enough according to the FAIR4FOIS guidelines, the authors will be informed and allowed time to improve their submission by the camera-ready deadline.  
 Only papers that fulfill the FAIR requirements will be published in the FOIS proceedings.  
 Review criteria   
 Foundations track   
 Scope: | foundational papers address content-related ontological issues, their formal representation, and their relevance to some aspect of information systems. Foundational papers may explore domain general ontological topics (e.g., mereology) or be concerned with general categories (e.g., papers on upper ontologies). Papers concerned with the philosophical, logical or mathematical foundations of applied ontology are also included in this track. 
  Review criteria: | will consider (1) the significance and clarity of the problem statement; (2) the novelty and weight of the ontological / philosophical / logical / mathematical analysis; (3) the soundness of any formalism, (4) the relevance to some aspect of information systems; and (5) the adequate satisfaction of issues or requirements from the problem statement. If the paper contains theorems without proofs, the proofs should be made available to reviewers as an appendix to the paper. The page limit will not be applied to this appendix, and the appendix will not be included in the final publication. 
  Applications and Methods track   
 Scope: | papers in this track address novel methods, systems and tools related to building, evaluating, or using ontologies, emphasizing the impact of ontology contents on the application. If a paper is about how ontologies are used in some computational system, such as for recommendation, semantic search, or machine learning, or if it is about new methods or tools that, for example, help design, evaluate, modularize, or compare ontologies, then it belongs in this track. 
  Review criteria: | will follow typical computer science criteria, including the novelty, significance and soundness of the work as evident in the problem statement and requirements, the related work, as well as the methodology and evaluation, with evaluation typically including implementation, results, and analysis. 
  Domain Ontology track   
 Scope: | domain ontology papers describe a novel ontology for a specific realm of interest. The goal is not just to reproduce the content of the ontology in some abbreviated form, but to provide added value enabling a reader to better understand and use the ontology. Hence, the paper should focus on providing: (1) background information and an overview of contents (e.g., motivation, domain, scope, requirements, ontology language, modularity, statistical information); (2) a comparison with related ontologies to highlight differences and benefits; (3) a description of methodology and ontology design choices; (4) an evaluation of the ontology against requirements and possibly foundational theory, and (5) discussion of actual or potential use. Moreover, all ontologies discussed in the paper should be accessible to reviewers. 
  Review criteria: | will consider the novelty, significance, and soundness of the required elements (just listed above). 
  Publication   
 The FOIS proceedings will be published by IOS Press as open access.  
 We will adopt a post-proceedings format, i.e., the camera-ready version of the papers will be due after the conference. This allows authors to incorporate not only the feedback given by the reviewers, but also those received at the conference.  
 Authors will be allowed one extra page when preparing the camera-ready versions of their papers.

The proceedings volumes will appear in gold open access, so the published versions of all papers will be available for everyone to download from the publisher’s website freely from the date of online publication, perpetually. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States. For further information, please refer to the tourism website  .

 The International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS)  , organized by the International Association for Ontology and its Applications (IAOA), is a meeting point for all researchers with an interest in formal ontology. It aims to be a nexus of interdisciplinary research and communication for researchers from many domains engaging with formal ontology. Common application areas include conceptual modeling, database design, knowledge engineering and management, software engineering, organizational modeling, artificial intelligence, robotics, computational linguistics, the life sciences, bioinformatics and scientific research in general, geographic information science, information retrieval, library and information science, as well as the Semantic Web.  
 FOIS originated from the Project ONTOINT (Ontological Tools for Heterogeneous Knowledge Organization and Integration) funded by the Italian National Research Council which was the main conference organizer until IAOA was founded in 2009.  
 Prior to 2021 FOIS was held biennially.  
 ATTENTION!   
  Don’t mix up this conference series with the one of the same name organized by the World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology (WASET). WASET is a predatory  conference organizer and publisher.  
   
 The Joint Ontology WOrkshops (JOWO)  is a venue of workshops and tutorials that, together, address a wide spectrum of topics related to ontology research, ranging from Cognitive Science to Knowledge Representation, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Logic, Philosophy, and Linguistics. JOWO’s mission is to provide a platform for the diverse communities interested in building, reasoning with, and applying formalised ontologies in the wide spectrum of Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Philosophy, Linguistics and Cognitive Science, both in theory and applications. JOWO is organized annually, biennialy in conjunction with FOIS  
 The Workshops on Modular Ontologies (WoMO)  , exclusively devoted to the topic of modularity in ontologies, have been organized annually from 2006 to 2015. From 2010 to 2014 in conjunction with FOIS.

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 The ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays is a premier conference for presentation of advances in FPGA technology. In 2025, the 33rd edition of ISFPGA will be held in Monterey, California, USA. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and available in the ACM Digital Library. At least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel.  
   
 Paper Submissions (with and without artifacts)   
 We solicit research papers related to the following areas:  
 FPGA Architecture | : Architectures for programmable logic fabrics or their components, including routing, flexible logic cells, embedded blocks (memory, DSP, processors), and I/O interfaces. Novel commercial architectures and architectural features. 
  FPGA Circuit Design | : Circuits and layout techniques for the design of FPGAs. Impact of future process and design technologies on FPGAs as well as novel memory or nano-scale devices. Methods for analyzing and improving static and dynamic power consumption, power and clock distribution, yield, manufacturability, security, reliability, and testability. 
  CAD for FPGAs | : Algorithms for synthesis, technology mapping, logic and timing optimization, clustering, placement, and routing of FPGAs. Novel design software for system-level partitioning, debug, and verification. Algorithms for modeling, analysis and optimization of timing and power. 
  High-Level Abstractions and Tools for FPGAs | : General-purpose and domain-specific languages, tools, and techniques to facilitate the design, debugging and verification of FPGA-based applications and systems. Novel hardware/software co-design and high-level synthesis methodologies enabling digital signal processing, compute acceleration, networking, machine learning, and embedded systems. 
  FPGA-based and FPGA-like Computing Engines | : Systems and software for compiled accelerators, reconfigurable/adaptive computing, and rapid-prototyping. Programmable overlay architectures implemented using FPGAs. 
  Applications and Design Studies: | Implementation of novel designs on FPGAs establishing state-of-the-art in high-performance, low-power, security, or high-reliability. Designs leveraging unique capabilities of FPGA architectures or demonstrating significant improvements over alternative programmable technologies (e.g., CPU, GPU). Design studies or architecture explorations enabling improvement of FPGA architectures. 
  AI/ML for and on FPGAs: | Architectures and implementations of FPGA-based processors for AI/ML algorithms, such as Small Language Models and Large Language Models. Novel uses of AI models to aid in the design and programming of FPGAs. 
  Research submissions can be in either of two categories:  
 Regular | — at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference. 
  Short | — at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation. 
  A paper submitted as either regular or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).  
   
 Submission Process   
 Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/  . LaTeX users should use the format used in the sample-sigconf.pdf file under the Samples folder of the zipped master file (available through the LaTeX link). Microsoft Word users can download the file Interim layout.docx under the Word Authors section of the page. Abstract and paper submissions in PDF must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere-on-Earth time zone).  
 Submissions will be considered for acceptance as regular or short papers. A paper submitted to the regular or short category will only be considered in that category. Regular or short submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. Once a paper has been submitted, its authorship list is considered to be fixed and final.  
 By submitting articles to an ACM Publication, authors are hereby acknowledging that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of their paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Authors should ensure that they and their co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  (https://orcid.org/register), so that they can complete the publishing process for accepted papers. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ACM has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of their published authors  (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2023. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; authors’ ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
   
 Double Blind Policy   
 The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person, in the same way one would reference work by others. If necessary to maintain anonymity, citations may be shown as “Removed for blind review,” but consider that this may impede a thorough review if the removed citation is crucial to understanding the submission. When necessary, authors should cite widely-available Open Source software website(s) without claiming ownership. Grant numbers and other government markings should also be blinded during the review process. Placing a preliminary version of the unpublished paper on arXiv is not disqualifying, but it is also not encouraged. Similarly, if a paper can be unblinded by active search, this is not considered to undermine the spirit of the double-blind review. However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github  .  
 If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline.  
   
 Reviewer Conflict Policy   
 During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be registered with all possible program committee members. Conflicts are defined as all relationships that would prevent a reviewer from objectively evaluating the submitted work. This includes, but is not limited to, having within the past 5 years, 1) co-authored a publication, or 2) shared a funding award, and 3) shared at least one institutional affiliation. Note: if a conflict is left undeclared or a nonexistent conflict is declared in an attempt to manipulate the review process, the submission may be rejected.  
 For more information about the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy, see: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   
   
 Originality of Submissions   
 Papers submitted are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have archived proceedings.  
   
 Rebuttal Process   
 The conference review process includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response to reviewers’ questions and comments. This information is considered during the final deliberation process.  
   
 Author participation   
 For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel (more instruction will be available after the camera-ready submission).

 Authors of this year’s best manuscripts will be eligible for the conference’s best paper awards. They will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM’s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS).  
   
 Artifact Evaluation   
 The conference will allow authors to submit accompanying artifacts for their paper submissions for evaluation. This process will allow ACM recognized badges to be associated with the final publication. The inclusion of artifacts with a submission is not required for a paper submission nor will any preference be given to submissions with artifacts over those without. Papers and artifacts will be subjected to separate and independent review processes. Artifact evaluation must NOT interfere with the double blind reviewing process of their accompanying papers, so all accompanying links in the paper to the artifacts should be blinded. All authors will be required at the time of paper submission to indicate if there will also be associated artifacts for evaluation. If artifacts will be included, a descriptor of their nature will be required.  
 For more information, see: https://isfpga.org/artifact-evaluation/   
   
 Diversity and Inclusion   
 The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the conference. The organizers aim and commit to providing a harassment-free accessible and pleasant conference experience with equity in rights for all. We want every participant to feel welcome, included and safe at the conference.

 Submissions Due:  October 8, 2024  
   
 The ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays is a premier conference for presentation of advances in FPGA technology. In 2025, the 33rd edition of ISFPGA will be held in Monterey, California, USA. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and available in the ACM Digital Library. At least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel.  
   
 Paper Submissions (with and without artifacts)   
 We solicit research papers related to the following areas:  
 FPGA Architecture | : Architectures for programmable logic fabrics or their components, including routing, flexible logic cells, embedded blocks (memory, DSP, processors), and I/O interfaces. Novel commercial architectures and architectural features. 
  FPGA Circuit Design | : Circuits and layout techniques for the design of FPGAs. Impact of future process and design technologies on FPGAs as well as novel memory or nano-scale devices. Methods for analyzing and improving static and dynamic power consumption, power and clock distribution, yield, manufacturability, security, reliability, and testability. 
  CAD for FPGAs | : Algorithms for synthesis, technology mapping, logic and timing optimization, clustering, placement, and routing of FPGAs. Novel design software for system-level partitioning, debug, and verification. Algorithms for modeling, analysis and optimization of timing and power. 
  High-Level Abstractions and Tools for FPGAs | : General-purpose and domain-specific languages, tools, and techniques to facilitate the design, debugging and verification of FPGA-based applications and systems. Novel hardware/software co-design and high-level synthesis methodologies enabling digital signal processing, compute acceleration, networking, machine learning, and embedded systems. 
  FPGA-based and FPGA-like Computing Engines | : Systems and software for compiled accelerators, reconfigurable/adaptive computing, and rapid-prototyping. Programmable overlay architectures implemented using FPGAs. 
  Applications and Design Studies: | Implementation of novel designs on FPGAs establishing state-of-the-art in high-performance, low-power, security, or high-reliability. Designs leveraging unique capabilities of FPGA architectures or demonstrating significant improvements over alternative programmable technologies (e.g., CPU, GPU). Design studies or architecture explorations enabling improvement of FPGA architectures. 
  AI/ML for and on FPGAs: | Architectures and implementations of FPGA-based processors for AI/ML algorithms, such as Small Language Models and Large Language Models. Novel uses of AI models to aid in the design and programming of FPGAs. 
  Research submissions can be in either of two categories:  
 Regular | — at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference. 
  Short | — at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation. 
  A paper submitted as either regular or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).  
   
 Submission Process   
 Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/  . LaTeX users should use the format used in the sample-sigconf.pdf file under the Samples folder of the zipped master file (available through the LaTeX link). Microsoft Word users can download the file Interim layout.docx under the Word Authors section of the page. Abstract and paper submissions in PDF must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere-on-Earth time zone).  
 Submissions will be considered for acceptance as regular or short papers. A paper submitted to the regular or short category will only be considered in that category. Regular or short submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. Once a paper has been submitted, its authorship list is considered to be fixed and final.  
 By submitting articles to an ACM Publication, authors are hereby acknowledging that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of their paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Authors should ensure that they and their co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  (https://orcid.org/register), so that they can complete the publishing process for accepted papers. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ACM has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of their published authors  (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2023. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; authors’ ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
   
 Double Blind Policy   
 The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person, in the same way one would reference work by others. If necessary to maintain anonymity, citations may be shown as “Removed for blind review,” but consider that this may impede a thorough review if the removed citation is crucial to understanding the submission. When necessary, authors should cite widely-available Open Source software website(s) without claiming ownership. Grant numbers and other government markings should also be blinded during the review process. Placing a preliminary version of the unpublished paper on arXiv is not disqualifying, but it is also not encouraged. Similarly, if a paper can be unblinded by active search, this is not considered to undermine the spirit of the double-blind review. However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github  .  
 If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline.  
   
 Reviewer Conflict Policy   
 During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be registered with all possible program committee members. Conflicts are defined as all relationships that would prevent a reviewer from objectively evaluating the submitted work. This includes, but is not limited to, having within the past 5 years, 1) co-authored a publication, or 2) shared a funding award, and 3) shared at least one institutional affiliation. Note: if a conflict is left undeclared or a nonexistent conflict is declared in an attempt to manipulate the review process, the submission may be rejected.  
 For more information about the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy, see: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   
   
 Originality of Submissions   
 Papers submitted are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have archived proceedings.  
   
 Rebuttal Process   
 The conference review process includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response to reviewers’ questions and comments. This information is considered during the final deliberation process.  
   
 Author participation   
 For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel (more instruction will be available after the camera-ready submission).  
   
 Best Paper Award   
 Authors of this year’s best manuscripts will be eligible for the conference’s best paper awards. They will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM’s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS).

However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github  .  
 If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline.  
   
 Reviewer Conflict Policy   
 During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be registered with all possible program committee members. Conflicts are defined as all relationships that would prevent a reviewer from objectively evaluating the submitted work. This includes, but is not limited to, having within the past 5 years, 1) co-authored a publication, or 2) shared a funding award, and 3) shared at least one institutional affiliation. Note: if a conflict is left undeclared or a nonexistent conflict is declared in an attempt to manipulate the review process, the submission may be rejected.  
 For more information about the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy, see: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   
   
 Originality of Submissions   
 Papers submitted are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have archived proceedings.  
   
 Rebuttal Process   
 The conference review process includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response to reviewers’ questions and comments. This information is considered during the final deliberation process.  
   
 Author participation   
 For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel (more instruction will be available after the camera-ready submission).  
   
 Best Paper Award   
 Authors of this year’s best manuscripts will be eligible for the conference’s best paper awards. They will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM’s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS).  
   
 Artifact Evaluation   
 The conference will allow authors to submit accompanying artifacts for their paper submissions for evaluation. This process will allow ACM recognized badges to be associated with the final publication. The inclusion of artifacts with a submission is not required for a paper submission nor will any preference be given to submissions with artifacts over those without. Papers and artifacts will be subjected to separate and independent review processes. Artifact evaluation must NOT interfere with the double blind reviewing process of their accompanying papers, so all accompanying links in the paper to the artifacts should be blinded. All authors will be required at the time of paper submission to indicate if there will also be associated artifacts for evaluation. If artifacts will be included, a descriptor of their nature will be required.  
 For more information, see: https://isfpga.org/artifact-evaluation/   
   
 Diversity and Inclusion   
 The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the conference. The organizers aim and commit to providing a harassment-free accessible and pleasant conference experience with equity in rights for all. We want every participant to feel welcome, included and safe at the conference.

  Research submissions can be in either of two categories:  
 Regular | — at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference. 
  Short | — at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation. 
  A paper submitted as either regular or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).  
   
 Submission Process   
 Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/  . LaTeX users should use the format used in the sample-sigconf.pdf file under the Samples folder of the zipped master file (available through the LaTeX link). Microsoft Word users can download the file Interim layout.docx under the Word Authors section of the page. Abstract and paper submissions in PDF must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere-on-Earth time zone).  
 Submissions will be considered for acceptance as regular or short papers. A paper submitted to the regular or short category will only be considered in that category. Regular or short submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. Once a paper has been submitted, its authorship list is considered to be fixed and final.  
 By submitting articles to an ACM Publication, authors are hereby acknowledging that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of their paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Authors should ensure that they and their co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  (https://orcid.org/register), so that they can complete the publishing process for accepted papers. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ACM has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of their published authors  (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2023. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; authors’ ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
   
 Double Blind Policy   
 The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person, in the same way one would reference work by others. If necessary to maintain anonymity, citations may be shown as “Removed for blind review,” but consider that this may impede a thorough review if the removed citation is crucial to understanding the submission. When necessary, authors should cite widely-available Open Source software website(s) without claiming ownership. Grant numbers and other government markings should also be blinded during the review process. Placing a preliminary version of the unpublished paper on arXiv is not disqualifying, but it is also not encouraged. Similarly, if a paper can be unblinded by active search, this is not considered to undermine the spirit of the double-blind review. However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github  .  
 If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline.

 International Conference on  
  Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQAS)  
 FQAS is the premier conference focusing on the key issue in the information society of providing flexible, easy, and (for human) intuitive access to information. In targeting this issue, the conference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, data science, information filtering, knowledge representation, logics, uncertainty handling, knowledge discovery, analytics, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human-computer interaction.  
 The guiding topic of the FQAS conferences are innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, flexible and human-friendly access to information. Such systems are becoming increasingly important also due to the huge and always growing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.  
 Since 1994, the conference has provided a unique and multidisciplinary forum for researchers, developers and practitioners to explore and exchange new ideas and approaches in all mentioned research areas.

If you use MS PowerPoint you might use instructions from the following link to prepare your video https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narrat…  We welcome you to submit your papers to FRUCT37  .  
 The conference sessions for online participants are split into 2 parts:  
 Self-watching of presentations on Youtube (the corresponding playlists and links will be published in the | conference program | ). Let’s take advantage of distant participation - you can invite colleagues to watch videos and the online session. I also ask you to subscribe to FRUCT youtube channel – we need to get 1000 subscribers to be allowed make video streaming in the future. 
  Online questions and answers session held in Zoom. As some conference participants report issues with Internet connection quality we recommend to held Zoom session in Audio only mode (without video). Please prepare your questions/comments to the authors and use this time to discuss the presented works. 
  Overview of FRUCT  
 FRUCT is a large Pan-European cooperation framework that promotes open innovations of academia and industry. FRUCT conference is a high-quality scientific event for meeting academia and business people and setting projects. The average conference is attended by over 120 participants from 20+ countries, including both the representatives from academia and industry.  
 The conference attracts most active and talented students to present their R&D projects, meet people alike, create new teams, and find employers and investors. The conference invites the world-class academic and industrial experts to lecture on the hottest topics. Traditionally the program consists of FRUCT work groups meetings and 3 days (We-Fr) of the main conference.   
 FRUCT conferences are organized every half a year, which is the reason for submission and acceptance notification deadlines be so close to the conference dates. If you need more time for visa and travel arrangements  just notify us by email and submit your paper following the Early bird submission deadline.  Then your paper will be taken to the early-review procedure and you get the notification of acceptance one month earlier.  
 Traditionally FRUCT pays a lot of attention to the Open Source and supports the corresponding activities and communities. The conference Demo session will include a lot of demos. The conference is supported by the local mobile Linux community and we welcome all mobile Linux and other apps developer to attend this event.  
 We welcome everybody to submit papers and take part in the conference, share your research and join the FRUCT Association. Thanks to sponsors we traditionally have low registration fee and various discounts can be applied. Please take early registration  to get the best fee and most advantages of your participation in the conference.  
 All conference papers and abstracts will be published Open Access in FRUCT proceeding at no additional cost (available for free under a CC BY-ND license download from FRUCT proceedings catalog  ).  
 We welcome patrons/sponsors to join the conference team. Please refer to the overview of patrons’ packages  and contact us  in case of any questions and proposals.  
 Background and motivation  
 The distinctive feature of modern IT and Telecommunications industries is in dramatic shortening of the period when technology remains commercially viable. On the one hand, this is due to the competition between key market players that are pushing all manufacturers to accelerate innovations; on the other hand, this is due to technological progress speed up caused by the growing expansion of intellectual resource invested into R&D and design activities. This trend is an important call and challenge for the leading educational and research institutions around the globe. In the FRUCT we believe that it is crucial to support practical cooperation between universities and industrial research. We also target in increasing visibility of involved research teams and set direct personal contacts between academic and industrial experts.  
 Call for papers and presentations  
 You can select one of the following 3 types of submissions:  
 Full papers (min 6 full pages and up to 12 pages), deadline | 3 March 2025; 
  Short papers (min 2 pages, max 6 pages), deadline | 3 March 2025; 
  Poster / demo summary (min 200 words, max 4 pages), by | 30 April 2025. 
  Traditionally FRUCT doesn’t provide deadline extension, as instead we have early-bird submissions mechanism. But if authors need couple of extra days to finalize a paper, please send in advance email to info@fruct.org  and we will try to arrange it so that you can finalize your work.  
 The review process is organized as follows:  
 Full papers get at least 3 reviews by the | Technical Committee 
  Short papers and Poster/demo summaries get at least 2 reviews by the | Technical Committee 
  The review process is organized as the single-blind review 
  The acceptance rate is 40% (5 years) 
  Authors of selected best papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to be published in partner journals. 
  Please note that some papers submitted as Full Papers can be recommended for publication in Work in Progress (WiP) section of the proceedings. The WiP section includes papers that have passed the quality check, but didn’t get in top 40% of the papers based on the average score. This will be a normal publication, but with less guaranteed indexing, read more  . To increase your chance to get your paper accepted as Full Paper, we recommend to submit it by the Early bird submission deadline, as this way you always will have a second chance to improve the paper and get another round of review. The conference language is English.  
 The Early bird submission deadline: 3 February 2025.   
 Please note that one person can be a coauthor of at maximum 3 submissions of all types: SUBMIT
