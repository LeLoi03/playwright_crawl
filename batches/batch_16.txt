 Call for Papers  
   
  JSSPP welcomes Regular Papers (RP)  as well as descriptions of Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  and Workload Traces (WT)  coming from interesting scheduling domains (see below). Our goal with the OSP papers is to build a bridge between the production and research worlds, enhancing mutual understanding and reproducibility to facilitate direct collaborations and impact. Our goal with the WT papers is to tackle the lack of real-world data that often hampers the ability of the research community to engage with scheduling problems in a way that has a real-world impact.  
 Call for Regular Papers (RP)  
 JSSPP solicits regular papers that focus on challenges in parallel scheduling, including but not limited to: Design of new scheduling approaches. 
  Performance evaluation of scheduling approaches, including methodology, benchmarks, and metrics. 
  Fulfilling additional constraints in scheduling systems, like job priorities, price, energy requirements (Green Computing), accounting, load estimation, and quality of service guarantees. 
  Impact of scheduling strategies on system utilization, application performance, user-friendliness, cost efficiency, and energy efficiency. 
  Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems. 
  Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability. 
  Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant) 
  Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system, etc. 
  Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems. 
  GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling. 
  AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches. 
  Call for Workload Traces (WT)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers introducing workload traces from workloads of real systems that offer challenges in the context of this workshop. These submissions should include: Anonymized (if needed) workload artifacts that describe a significant share of individual units of resource scheduling (jobs, pods, VMs, functions, etc.) during a period of life in a parallel computing system. 
  A description of the parallel system running these workloads. 
  An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems. 
  We ask submitters to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF  ) to represent their traces or to attach schemas that allow interpreting them. The submission of artifacts that model the workloads is also encouraged. Call for Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers describing open problems in large-scale scheduling. We believe that clearly described real-world scheduling problems will help both the industry and the scientific communities to bridge the gap that often prevents the adoption of newly proposed scheduling techniques in practice. Effective scheduling approaches are predicated on three things: A concise understanding of scheduling goals, and how they relate to one another. 
  Details of the workload (job arrival times, sizes, shareability, deadlines, etc.) 
  Details of the system being managed (size, break/fix lifecycle, allocation constraints) 
  Submissions must include a concise description of the key metrics of the system and how they are calculated, as well as anonymized data publication of the system workload and production schedule. Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published, though we understand this might be more difficult. We envision that OSP papers will stimulate the development of new scheduling approaches, which can be robustly compared with the schedules used in production facilities, and other approaches to solve the same problems. Submission Format  
 Paper formatting requirements are the same for Regular Papers, Workload Traces, and OSP-related submissions. Papers should be no longer than 20 single-spaced pages, 10pt font, including figures and references. All submissions must follow the LNCS format  . See the instructions at Springer's website: http://www.springer.com/lncs  or in the Submission section  .  
   
 All papers in scope will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee  .  
  Submissions are accepted by EasyChair submission page  .  
   Submission is open

 18th Edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence  
 September 20-22 2023,  
  hosted by TU Dresden, Germany  

 About JELIA 2023  

 Welcome to JELIA 2023, the 18th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence, to be held in Dresden by the International Center for Computational Logic of TU Dresden   .  
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence   (or Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with proceedings published in the Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence   . Previous meetings took place in Roscoff France (1988), Amsterdam Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK (1994), Évora Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga, Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004), Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland (2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca, Cyprus (2016), Rende Italy (2019), Klagenfurt, Austria (2021).  
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.

 Call for Papers  
   
  JSSPP welcomes Regular Papers (RP)  as well as descriptions of Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  and Workload Traces (WT)  coming from interesting scheduling domains (see below). Our goal with the OSP papers is to build a bridge between the production and research worlds, enhancing mutual understanding and reproducibility to facilitate direct collaborations and impact. Our goal with the WT papers is to tackle the lack of real-world data that often hampers the ability of the research community to engage with scheduling problems in a way that has a real-world impact.  
 Call for Regular Papers (RP)  
 JSSPP solicits regular papers that focus on challenges in parallel scheduling, including but not limited to: Design of new scheduling approaches. 
  Performance evaluation of scheduling approaches, including methodology, benchmarks, and metrics. 
  Fulfilling additional constraints in scheduling systems, like job priorities, price, energy requirements (Green Computing), accounting, load estimation, and quality of service guarantees. 
  Impact of scheduling strategies on system utilization, application performance, user-friendliness, cost efficiency, and energy efficiency. 
  Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems. 
  Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability. 
  Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant) 
  Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system, etc. 
  Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems. 
  GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling. 
  AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches. 
  Call for Workload Traces (WT)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers introducing workload traces from workloads of real systems that offer challenges in the context of this workshop. These submissions should include: Anonymized (if needed) workload artifacts that describe a significant share of individual units of resource scheduling (jobs, pods, VMs, functions, etc.) during a period of life in a parallel computing system. 
  A description of the parallel system running these workloads. 
  An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems. 
  We ask submitters to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF  ) to represent their traces or to attach schemas that allow interpreting them. The submission of artifacts that model the workloads is also encouraged. Call for Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers describing open problems in large-scale scheduling. We believe that clearly described real-world scheduling problems will help both the industry and the scientific communities to bridge the gap that often prevents the adoption of newly proposed scheduling techniques in practice. Effective scheduling approaches are predicated on three things: A concise understanding of scheduling goals, and how they relate to one another. 
  Details of the workload (job arrival times, sizes, shareability, deadlines, etc.) 
  Details of the system being managed (size, break/fix lifecycle, allocation constraints) 
  Submissions must include a concise description of the key metrics of the system and how they are calculated, as well as anonymized data publication of the system workload and production schedule. Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published, though we understand this might be more difficult. We envision that OSP papers will stimulate the development of new scheduling approaches, which can be robustly compared with the schedules used in production facilities, and other approaches to solve the same problems. Submission Format  
 Paper formatting requirements are the same for Regular Papers, Workload Traces, and OSP-related submissions. Papers should be no longer than 20 single-spaced pages, 10pt font, including figures and references. All submissions must follow the LNCS format  . See the instructions at Springer's website: http://www.springer.com/lncs  or in the Submission section  .  
   
 All papers in scope will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee  .  
  Submissions are accepted by EasyChair submission page  .  
   Submission is open

  About 

 European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA)   
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA for Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle) began back in 1988 as a workshop in response to the need for a European forum to discuss emerging work in this field.  
  Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
  The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and its overall technical quality have turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.  
 EurAI sponsored the 16th edition of JELIA  ( 2019, Rende - Italy  )

 Research Track: Call for Papers (August Cycle)  
 KDD is the premier Data Science conference, hosting both a Research and an Applied Data Science Track. A paper should either be submitted to the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track but not    both.  
 KDD has multiple submission cycles per year  . KDD 2025 will have two deadlines, one on August 1, 2024 and another on February 1, 2025 (with full paper deadlines a week after the abstract submission deadlines). Likewise, the KDD Proceedings will have two installments. Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 The conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, expected in August 2025.

  Notification: Nov 16, 2024 
  Camera-ready: | Dec 19, 2024 | TBD 
  Conference: Aug 3-7, 2025 
  All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  time zone.  
 Submission Site   
 We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.  
 All listed authors must  have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:  
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that | can take up to two weeks | . 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete  , each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory  fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be indicated wherever applicable.  
 Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview  .  
   
  Scope   
   
  For the research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Data Science: | Methods for analyzing social networks, time series, sequences, streams, text, web, graphs, rules, patterns, logs, IoT data, spatio-temporal data, biological data, scientific and business data; recommender systems, computational advertising, multimedia, finance, bioinformatics. 
  Big Data: | Large-scale systems for data analysis, machine learning, optimization, sampling, summarization; parallel and distributed data science (cloud, map-reduce, federated learning); novel algorithmic and statistical techniques for big data; algorithmically-efficient data transformation and integration. 
  Foundations: | Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics and robustness. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 Deadlines  . The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.  
 Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools  . Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.  
 Maximum authorship. In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to | 7 | (seven) | maximum. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. 
  Authorship changes. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized | by submission deadline | . There | cannot | be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. 
  Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to refer to your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.  
 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}   Submissions must be a single  PDF file: 8  (eight)  content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits. The Appendix can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc. The first 8 pages should be self-contained  , since reviewers are not required to read past that. Note that different limits will apply to camera-ready (see below).  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.  
 Resubmission Guidelines  . A paper that receives a Resubmit  decision during the Feb 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Aug 2024 deadline. A paper that was rejected during the Feb 2024 deadline could not  submit a revision, and could not  be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Aug 2024 deadline. Please also refer to the FAQ for Resubmission  .  
 Resubmission must be indicated upon submission, along with the OpenReview forum id  of the previous submission. The resubmission should also include a summary of changes (limited to 5000 characters) in the submission form. The reviewers/AC/SAC will have visibility of the previous submission and reviews. We anticipate that Resubmit  papers that address the previously noted concerns appropriately would have a higher acceptance rate than fresh submissions, owing to the former’s selectivity and potential improvements.  
 Correspondingly, some of the fresh submissions to the Aug 2024 deadline may receive a Resubmit  decision for Feb 2025 deadline.  
 Serving as Reviewer  . To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences). Being named as a reviewer in the submission constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular reviewing load responsibly. Only if no qualified reviewer exists in the author list, nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC chairs. Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty properly, is sufficient ground for desk rejection.  
 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.  
 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.  
 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.   
 Reviewing Process  
 Reviewing  . Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC). At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer, carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on time. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing task in a proper  and timely  manner, no author of that submission will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.  
 Any use of generative AI tools during the reviewing process must be disclosed in the review form. In particular, verbatim uploading of any passage from the paper being reviewed to any generative AI tool is forbidden.  
 Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period. The ACs will consider the authors’ response to the points raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to inform acceptance decisions.  
 Withdrawal  . Authors may request to withdraw their submissions only  during the rebuttal period. Such requests must be made in written form to the PC Chairs and are completed only upon their acknowledgment.  
 Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.  
 Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2025, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.  
 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. A domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) must be declared for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. A personal conflict  should be declared when the following associations exist:  
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
  active collaborator 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 
  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .  
 Any transgression that falls short of ethical standards will be investigated and may face disciplinary actions. Such transgressions include, but are not limited to, falsification, dual submission, collusion, pressuring any member of the program committee. Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  
 Publication and Presentation Policies  
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  
 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 Research Track: Call for Papers (August Cycle)  
 KDD is the premier Data Science conference, hosting both a Research and an Applied Data Science Track. A paper should either be submitted to the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track but not    both.  
 KDD has multiple submission cycles per year  . KDD 2025 will have two deadlines, one on August 1, 2024 and another on February 1, 2025 (with full paper deadlines a week after the abstract submission deadlines). Likewise, the KDD Proceedings will have two installments. Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 The conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, expected in August 2025.  
 Important Dates   
 Abstract Deadline: Aug 1, 2024 
  Paper Deadline: Aug 8, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: Oct 4-18, 2024 
  Notification: Nov 16, 2024 
  Camera-ready: | Dec 19, 2024 | TBD 
  Conference: Aug 3-7, 2025 
  All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  time zone.  
 Submission Site   
 We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.  
 All listed authors must  have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:  
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that | can take up to two weeks | . 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete  , each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory  fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be indicated wherever applicable.  
 Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview  .  
   
  Scope   
   
  For the research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Data Science: | Methods for analyzing social networks, time series, sequences, streams, text, web, graphs, rules, patterns, logs, IoT data, spatio-temporal data, biological data, scientific and business data; recommender systems, computational advertising, multimedia, finance, bioinformatics. 
  Big Data: | Large-scale systems for data analysis, machine learning, optimization, sampling, summarization; parallel and distributed data science (cloud, map-reduce, federated learning); novel algorithmic and statistical techniques for big data; algorithmically-efficient data transformation and integration. 
  Foundations: | Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics and robustness. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 Deadlines  . The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.  
 Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools  . Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.  
 Maximum authorship. In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to | 7 | (seven) | maximum. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. 
  Authorship changes. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized | by submission deadline | . There | cannot | be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. 
  Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to refer to your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.  
 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}   Submissions must be a single  PDF file: 8  (eight)  content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits. The Appendix can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc. The first 8 pages should be self-contained  , since reviewers are not required to read past that. Note that different limits will apply to camera-ready (see below).  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.  
 Resubmission Guidelines  . A paper that receives a Resubmit  decision during the Feb 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Aug 2024 deadline. A paper that was rejected during the Feb 2024 deadline could not  submit a revision, and could not  be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Aug 2024 deadline. Please also refer to the FAQ for Resubmission  .  
 Resubmission must be indicated upon submission, along with the OpenReview forum id  of the previous submission. The resubmission should also include a summary of changes (limited to 5000 characters) in the submission form. The reviewers/AC/SAC will have visibility of the previous submission and reviews. We anticipate that Resubmit  papers that address the previously noted concerns appropriately would have a higher acceptance rate than fresh submissions, owing to the former’s selectivity and potential improvements.  
 Correspondingly, some of the fresh submissions to the Aug 2024 deadline may receive a Resubmit  decision for Feb 2025 deadline.  
 Serving as Reviewer  . To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences). Being named as a reviewer in the submission constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular reviewing load responsibly. Only if no qualified reviewer exists in the author list, nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC chairs. Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty properly, is sufficient ground for desk rejection.  
 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.  
 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.  
 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.   
 Reviewing Process  
 Reviewing  . Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC). At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer, carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on time. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing task in a proper  and timely  manner, no author of that submission will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.  
 Any use of generative AI tools during the reviewing process must be disclosed in the review form. In particular, verbatim uploading of any passage from the paper being reviewed to any generative AI tool is forbidden.  
 Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period. The ACs will consider the authors’ response to the points raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to inform acceptance decisions.  
 Withdrawal  . Authors may request to withdraw their submissions only  during the rebuttal period. Such requests must be made in written form to the PC Chairs and are completed only upon their acknowledgment.  
 Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.  
 Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2025, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.  
 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. A domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) must be declared for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. A personal conflict  should be declared when the following associations exist:  
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
  active collaborator 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 
  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .  
 Any transgression that falls short of ethical standards will be investigated and may face disciplinary actions. Such transgressions include, but are not limited to, falsification, dual submission, collusion, pressuring any member of the program committee. Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  
 Publication and Presentation Policies  
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  
 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  
 Publication and Presentation Policies  
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  
 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

14. Conference K-CAP_3:
K-CAP 2023  
 The Twelfth International Conference on Knowledge Capture  
 December 5 - 7, 2023  
 Pensacola, Florida, USA  

 Knowledge has played a fundamental role since the inception of artificial intelligence. While the forms in which algorithms have leveraged knowledge have evolved over time, the need for efficient representations is ever more critical. Indeed, recent advances of AI, such as the stunning performance of large language models have relied on the large amount of data available on the Web. There is growing agreement among researchers that it's important to look beyond the sheer volume of data, and instead also prioritize the development of methods that are accurate, precise, and efficient for capturing knowledge.  
 The International Conference on Knowledge Capture, K-CAP, aims at bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers on a diverse set of topics with interest in the development of knowledge capture. This involves the design and development of formalisms, methods and tools that enable efficient and precise extraction and organization of knowledge from different sources and for different modalities of use including, for example, automated reasoning, machine learning and human-machine teaming.  
  
 To enable a vibrant and constructive discussion on scalable and precise knowledge capture, K-CAP 2023, calls for the participation of researchers from diverse areas of artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to, knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge acquisition, semantic web, intelligent user interfaces for knowledge acquisition and retrieval, query processing and question answering over heterogeneous knowledge bases, novel evaluation paradigms, problem-solving and reasoning, ethics and AI, explainability, neurosymbolic AI, agents, information extraction from structured or unstructured data, machine learning and representation learning, information enrichment and visualization, as well as researchers interested in cyber-infrastructures to foster the publication, retrieval, reuse, and integration of data.  
 K-CAP is an in-person conference, and remote participation will not be supported.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 by Blindboy Boatclub  
 €9.49    
 'Memorable, unsettling and humane' GUARDIAN 'One of the best books I have ever read ... I can't recommend him or it enough' JOHNNY MARR 'One of the most gifted writers of his generation' IRISH TIMES Driving with a donkey stuffed in the back seat; jackdaws pecking brains out through the roof of a confessional box; cat piss and astronauts. This is not the world as you see it, but as it is, twisted from the maverick mind of Blindboy Boatclub. These are stories of the strange unsettlings in the souls of men caught in between the past and the possible; stories of heart-blinding rage and disquieting compassion. Blindboy Boatclub is the essential voice for the Irish condition in the twenty-first century, and in Topographia Hibernica he unravels the knotted threads of humanity, nature and colonisation from a contemporary perspective. * Topographia Hibernica was a bestseller in Ireland in November 2023 *

 by Colleen Hoover  
 €9.49    
 THE MULTI-MILLION-COPY GLOBAL BESTSELLER. SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOVIE. Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn't hurt. Lily can't get him out of her head. But Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his "no dating" rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, It Ends With Us is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

 6.  Fiance Dilemma  
 by Elena Armas  
 €9.49    
 Josie Moore has given the opposite sex––and love––plenty of chances. Four exactly, if you count all her failed engagements, and five if you include the absentee father who kept her existence a secret until very recently. So when her father decides to announce his retirement with a splashy magazine piece about the family, Josie realizes her romantic history is a complicated PR issue. Matthew Flanagan is the mud, literally. Not only has he been fired from his job, but also the tires of his car are stuck in the muck after taking a wrong turn as he enters Green Oak, North Carolina. So, he grabs a duffel with his essentials and goes in b search of a place to crash until he gets his life back on track. But instead, he finds his best friend’s sister, Josie, greeting him as her fiancé. What starts as a big messy misunderstanding quickly turns into an arrangement with Matthew playing a new role as doting fiancé. A fifth engagement––and a stunt, at that––makes Josie’s stomach turn, but every dilemma requires a choice between equally undesirable alternatives, and Matthew doesn’t seem to mind becoming one more number in a colourful list of grooms-that-never-were. Despite the ring on her finger, Josie knows this is only temporary, even if the rest of the small town believes that the fifth time’s the charm.

Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author of The 9th Man and the Cotton Malone series Israel, late 1973. As the Yom Kippur War flares into life, a state-of-the-art Soviet MIG fighter is racing at breakneck speed over the arid scrublands below . . . and promptly disappears. NASA Flight Controller and former US Navy test pilot Kaz Zemeckis watches the scene from the ground - and is quickly pulled into a dizzying, high-stakes game of spies, lies and a possible high-level defection that plays out across three continents. The prize is beyond value: the secrets of the Soviets' mythical 'Foxbat' MiG-25, the fastest, highest-flying fighter plane in the world and the key to Cold War air supremacy. But every defection is double-edged with risk, and Kaz must tread a careful line between trust and suspicion. Ultimately, he must invite the fox into the henhouse - bringing the defector into the heart of the United States' most secret test site - and hope that, with skill and cunning, the game plays out his way. For Chris Hadfield's second heart-stopping thriller, we move from Space to another rich and exciting part of Chris's CV: his time as a top test pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and as an RCAF fighter pilot intercepting armed Soviet bombers in North American airspace. Full of insider detail, excitement and political intrigue drawn from real events, The Defector brings us the nerve-shredding rush of aerial combat, as told by one of the world's best fighter pilots.

 He had met her three times and three times forgotten all about her... William Barrow finds himself in lonely retirement in West Cork. Once an internationally renowned pianist, a terrible skin disease has attacked his hands and made it impossible for him to perform. All he can play, haltingly, is Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand. Tara is a piano teacher with barely enough pupils to pay the month's rent. In the local café, the elegant writing of a job advertisement catches her eye: 'Wanted. Housekeeper.'

When William stumbles upon a well in the back garden, Tara finds herself longing for revenge. She spins tales of a mythical saint, of the healing powers of the water and of the moss that surrounds it. But as the moss begins to heal William's troubled hands, the lines between legend and reality begin to blur, and past and present collide in unexpected ways. Gripping and lyrical, The Well of Saint Nobody is a story of love, secrets and the elusive possibility of second chances.

She loved Shay, of course she did, but right now the only person she wanted to think about was Conor. She didn't want to think about Bea or Lizzie or what Lizzie might have got up to with Shay. Frank's 48th birthday had given the three couples an excuse for a much needed night away from children, nagging bills and ailing parents. The drink flowed, life in Dublin with all its stress felt a long way away. When Frank proposed they swap partners, it felt deliciously, irresistibly reckless. One night. No obligations. No expectations. All the women had to do was text a man of their choice. The only rule? No falling in love. It was a night that some of them couldn't remember. And others couldn't forget.

In this brilliant standalone crime novel set in 1930s Munich, Detective Sebastian Wolff must walk a tight line between doing his job and falling foul of the Nazi party he despises. MUNICH, 1935 - The Bavarian capital is a magnet for young, aristocratic Britons who come to learn German, swim in the lakes and drink beer in the cellars. What they don't see - or choose to ignore - is the brutal underbelly of the Nazi movement which considers Munich its spiritual home. When a high-born English girl is murdered, Detective Sebastian Wolff is ordered to solve the crime. Wolff is already walking a tight line between doing his job and falling foul of the political party he abhors. Now Hitler is taking a personal interest in the case. Followed by the secret police and threatened by his own son, a fervent member of the Hitler Youth, the stakes have never been higher. And when Wolff begins to suspect that the killer might be linked to the highest reaches of the Nazi hierarchy, he fears his task is simply impossible - and that he might become the next victim.

In the summer of 1974 a heatwave blankets Boston and Mary Pat Fennessey is trying to stay one step ahead of the bill collectors. Mary Pat has lived her entire life in the housing projects of 'Southie', the Irish American enclave that stubbornly adheres to old tradition and stands proudly apart. One night Mary Pat's teenage daughter Jules stays out late and doesn't come home. That same evening, a young Black man is found dead, struck by a subway train under mysterious circumstances. The two events seem unconnected. But Mary Pat, propelled by a desperate search for her missing daughter, begins turning over stones best left untouched - asking questions that bother Marty Butler, chieftain of the Irish mob, and the men who work for him, men who don't take kindly to any threat to their business. Set against the hot, tumultuous months when the city's desegregation of its public schools exploded in violence, Small Mercies is a superb thriller, a brutal depiction of criminality and power, and an unflinching portrait of the dark heart of American racism.

She's his opposite in every way . . . and the greatest temptation he's ever known. Reserved, controlled, and proper to a fault, Kai Young has neither the time nor inclination for chaos - and Isabella, with her purple hair and inappropriate jokes, is chaos personified. With a crucial CEO vote looming and a media empire at stake, the billionaire heir can't afford the distraction she brings. Isabella is everything he shouldn't want, but with every look and every touch, he's tempted to break all his rules . . . and claim her as his own. *** Bold, impulsive, and full of life, Isabella Valencia has never met a party she doesn't like or a man she couldn't charm . . . except for Kai Young. It shouldn't matter. He's not her type - the man translates classics into Latin for fun, and his membership at the exclusive club where she bartends means he's strictly off limits. But she can't deny that, beneath his cool exterior, is a man who could make her melt with just a touch. No matter how hard they try, they can't resist giving into their forbidden desires. Even if it costs them everything. King of Pride is a steamy opposites attract billionaire romance. It includes explicit content and profanity.

Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally. The billionaire CEO never planned to marry - until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows: Vivian Lau, jewellery heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. It doesn't matter how beautiful or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal. There's only one problem: now that he has her . . . he can't bring himself to let her go. *** Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered. Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family's ticket into the highest echelons of high society.

 Meet the Kings of Sin . . . The must-read billionaire romance from the bestselling author of the Twisted series. 'Get ready for all the spice, all the build-up and all the sizzling tension' GLAMOUR Read King of Sloth now for a steamy reverse grumpy sunshine romance.

He also has no interest in taking over his family's empire (much to his father's chagrin), but that hasn't stopped women from throwing themselves at him . . . unless the woman in question is his publicist. Nothing brings him more joy than riling her up, but when a tragedy forces them closer than ever, he must grapple with the uncertainty of his future - and the realization that the only person immune to his charms is the only one he truly wants. *** Cool, intelligent, and ambitious, Sloane Kensington is a high-powered publicist who's used to dealing with difficult clients. However, none infuriate - or tempt - her more than a certain billionaire heir, with his stupid dimples and laid-back attitude. She may be forced to work with him, but she'll never fall for him . . . no matter how fast he makes her heart beat or how thoughtful he is beneath his party persona. He's her client, and that's all he'll ever be. Right? King of Sloth is a steamy reverse grumpy sunshine billionaire romance. It includes explicit content and profanity.

 by Ali Hazelwood  
 €9.49    
 A dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the New York Times bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis. Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast - again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold an historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange - again . . . Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It's clear from the way he tracks Misery's every movement that he doesn't trust her. If only he knew how right he was . . . Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what's hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory . . . alone with the wolf.

 #1 New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey is back in Napa Valley with this hilarious rom-com about a down-on-her-luck heiress who suggests a mutually beneficial marriage of convenience to a man she can't stand... only to discover there's a fine line between love and hate. After losing her job and her fiancé in one fell swoop, Natalie Vos returned home to lick her wounds. A few months later, she's sufficiently drowned her sorrows in cabernet and she's ready to get back on her feet. She just needs her trust fund to finance her new business venture. Unfortunately, the terms require she marry before she can have the money. And well, dumped, remember? But Natalie is desperate enough to propose to a man who makes her want to kill him-and kiss him, in equal measure. August Cates may own a vineyard, but he doesn't know jack about making wine. He's determined to do his late best friend proud, no matter what it takes. Except his tasting room is empty, his wine is disgusting (seriously, he once saw someone gag), and his buddy's legacy is circling the drain. No bank will give him the loan he needs to turn the business around... and then the gorgeous, feisty heiress knocks on his door. Natalie has haunted August's dreams since the moment they met, but their sizzling chemistry immediately morphed into simmering insults. Now, a quickie marriage could help them both. A sham wedding, a few weeks living under the same roof, and then they can go their separate ways-assuming they make it out alive. How hard could it be? There's just one thing they didn't account for: their unfortunate, unbearable, undeniable attraction.

  Abstract:  In this survey we discuss different state-of-the-art approaches of combining exact algorithms and metaheuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Some of these hybrids mainly aim at providing optimal solutions in shorter time, while others primarily focus on getting better heuristic solutions. The two main categories in which we divide the approaches are collaborative versus integrative combinations. We further classify the different techniques in a hierarchical way. Altogether, the surveyed work on combinations of exact algorithms and metaheuristics documents the usefulness and strong potential of this research direction.

  Abstract:  We address the problem of vehicle detection and tracking for traffic monitoring in Smart City applications. We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle’s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step. The approach is evaluated on a novel and challenging dataset with different video sequences recorded at urban environments, which is released with the paper. Our experimental validation confirms that the integration of an EKF with both detections and viewpoint estimations results beneficial.

  Abstract:  The “NP-Complete” class gathers very significant practical problems such as Sat, Max-Sat, partitioning. There is not polynomial algorithm for the resolution of these problems. As a result, the interest in heuristics and meta-heuristics is still growing. In this paper, we present a very recent metaheuristic introduced to solve a 3-sat problem. This metaheuristic can be classified as an evolutionary algorithm. It is based on the process of bees' reproduction. We adapted it for the resolution of the Max-Sat problem. We tested it on a medical benchmark obtained from a data-mining problem that we translated into a Max-Sat problem.

  Abstract:  Tissue P systems with cell division is a computing model in the framework of Membrane Computing based on intercellular communication and cooperation between neurons. The ability of cell division allows us to obtain an exponential amount of cells in linear time and to design cellular solutions to NP -complete problems in polynomial time. In this paper we present a solution to the Subset Sum problem via a family of such devices. This is the first solution to a numerical NP -complete problem by using tissue P systems with cell division.

  Abstract:  This paper presents a novel method to predict times series using deep learning. In particular, the method can be used for arbitrary time horizons, dividing each predicted sample into a single problem. This fact allows easy parallelization and adaptation to the big data context. Deep learning implementation in H2O library is used for each subproblem. However, H2O does not permit multi-step regression, therefore the solution proposed consists in splitting into h forecasting subproblems, being h the number of samples to be predicted, and, each of one has been separately studied, getting the best prediction model for each subproblem. Additionally, Apache Spark is used to load in memory large datasets and speed up the execution time. This methodology has been tested on a real-world dataset composed of electricity consumption in Spain, with a ten minute frequency sampling rate, from 2007 to 2016. Reported results exhibit errors less than 2%.

 Overview  
 Well-designed visualisations capitalise on human facilities for processing visual information and thereby improve comprehension, memory, inference, and decision making. In addition, the advent of the so-call “explosion of Big Data” has increased the needs of effective visualisation systems for data analysis and communication. In this course we will study techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualisations based on principles from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science. The course is targeted both towards students interested in using visualisation in their own work, as well as students interested in building better visualisation tools and systems. Learning outcomes  
 The lectures outlined below have been designed so that, by the end of course, students will have:  
 • an understanding of key visualization techniques and theory, including data models, graphical perception and methods for visual encoding and interaction.  
 • exposure to a number of common data domains and corresponding analysis tasks, including exploratory data analysis and network analysis.  
 • practical experience building and evaluating visualisation systems.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 CFP: Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics – Your Submission Is Welcome!  
  October 19th, 2020  Daniela Lopez de Luise   

 The 12 th  International Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics: IMCIC 2021  , will be held on March 9 – 12, 2021  , in Orlando, Florida, USA.  
 You can submit an article at  : http://www.iiis-2021conf.org/imcic   
 This conference has always contemplated the two modalities of participation: face to face and virtual  . However, given the current Coronavirus situation and travel restrictions, at this moment we are only accepting submissions for virtual participation. If the situation changes and we feel the safety of our participants would not be at risk, we will start accepting submissions for face-to-face participation, and those authors who submitted their article for virtual participation will have the ability to change their participation modality to face-to-face, if they wish.  
 The Proceedings of IMCIC and ICSIT/ICETI have been indexed by Elsevier's SCOPUS  since 2010. The 2021 proceedings will also be sent to Elsevier's SCOPUS.  
 The conference will also be jointly held with:  
 The 12 | th | International Conference on Education, Training and Informatics: ICETI 2021 
  The 12 | th | International Conference on Society and Information Technologies: ICSIT 2021 
  More details regarding these and other collocated events and special tracks can be found at: http://www.iiis-2021conf.org/cfp-spring2021.asp   
 The deadlines  for this CFP are as follows:  
 October 27 th  , 2020 | : Article submissions 
  October 27 th  , 2020 | : Invited/Special session proposals 
  November 25 th  , 2020 | : Notifications of acceptance 
  December 15 th  , 2020 | : Uploading of camera-ready or final version 
  Both synchronous and asynchronous virtual presentations are possible  . Therefore, the authors who participate virtually in the conference have the option of:  
 Submitting a slide show and/or a pre-recorded video of their presentation (asynchronous presentation) or 
  Making their presentation via Zoom (synchronous presentation) 
  Additionally, each paper to be presented at the event, virtually or in-person, may be read and commented on, via electronic forums, and evaluated by those participants who have registered for the conference.  
 You also have the option to contribute as a member of the Organizing Committee by accepting our invitation for organizing an invited or special session  , where you would have the responsibility of promoting your session and reviewing the articles submitted to you. You should appoint your own reviewers to support you. Effective organizers will be included as co-editors of the volume of the proceedings in which the papers of the session(s) that they organized have been included. If you accept this invitation, please submit your proposal through the conference web site.  
 Keynote speakers will be selected from registered authors whose submissions are among the best according to their external reviewers. The identification of the best submissions will be based on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the reviewers and the percentage of reviewers recommending the acceptance of the submission as related to all the reviewers who made their respective reviews. For this reason, we recommend you to submit your paper early  .  
 Registered authors of accepted submissions will be invited to make an additional presentation with no additional charge  , if such a presentation is oriented to inter-disciplinary communication. These authors will also have the option of writing an invited paper associated with their respective invited presentation.  
 Furthermore, the best papers presented at the conference, as selected by the audiences of each respective session, will also be published in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics (JCSI). JSCI is indexed in EBSCO, Cabell, DOAJ, and Google Scholar and is listed in Cabell Directory of Publishing Opportunities and in Ulrich's Periodical Directory.  
 For the past 25 years, professors, students, and researchers from all over the world have come together at our conferences to present research and engage in interdisciplinary discussion. It is this interdisciplinary focus that allows our attendees to discover new viewpoints they otherwise would not have discovered in a uni-disciplinary conference. These new viewpoints become intellectual seeds which, as they slowly bloom over time, expand their understanding of their own respective disciplines.  
 Many of our participants look forward to our conferences every year as they allow them to publish their papers, share their life's work, create a network of influential and like-minded colleagues, and expand their ever-growing understanding of their respective disciplines, as well as learn about new disciplines. Some testimonials can be read clicking on the button “  TESTIMONIALS” placed at the top of the left column of each of the conference web sites.  
 We hope to continue creating and expanding inter-disciplinary networks while facilitating the ever-growing expansion of each individual discipline represented at our conferences. We know this is only possible with contributions from people such as yourself. It is for this reason that we would greatly appreciate your contribution to the conference.  
 You are also welcome to forward this message to any appropriate colleagues and/or groups whose contributions would further promote the interdisciplinary growth of all the various disciplines represented in our conferences.  
 Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your contribution.  
 Respectfully,  
 IMCIC 2021 Organizing Committee

  Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated  
  symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of knowledge that would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics and natural language processing, and to fields beyond AI, including  
  data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering computational biology, and cybersecurity.  
   
  The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and practice of the representation and computational management of knowledge.  
   
  KR 2025 will consist of a number of tracks and events. It will include special thematic tracks and a Recently Published Research Track tutorials, workshops, and a Doctoral Consortium. Details about all these events and the corresponding calls will be on the website in due time.  
   
  We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage "reports from the field" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests. Further details about the submission guidelines and the selection criteria will be on the website in due time.

 Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, information systems and software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering.  
   
  Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce, business process management and enterprise engineering, among others.  
   
  KEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.

 Overview  
 The topic of the track covers an important field of research in Artificial Intelligence: KRR is indeed a trending topic (for instance, its Argumentation-theory subfield). A similar dedicated conference is the International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, but all the major conferences in AI (e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, ECAI) have KRR among their topics of interest. KRR track will be a venue for all the researchers and practitioners working on the fundaments (but also applications) of reasoning, and the cross-fertilization among different approaches (e.g., Argumentation and Belief Revision).  
  Scope  
 Knowledge-representation and Reasoning (KRR) is the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can be used to solve complex problems. Its goal is to understand and build intelligent behavior from the top down, focusing on what an agent needs to know with the purpose to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning procedures can make this knowledge available as needed. In KRR a fundamental assumption is that an agent's knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Argumentation 
  Constraint solving, programming, technologies 
  Belief revision and update, belief merging, etc. 
  Commonsense reasoning 
  Contextual reasoning 
  Description logics 
  Diagnosis, abduction, explanation 
  Inconsistency- and exception tolerant reasoning, para-consistent logics 
  KR and autonomous agents: intelligent agents, cognitive robotics multi-agent systems 
  KR and decision making, game theory, social choice 
  KR and machine learning, inductive logic programming, knowledge discovery and acquisition 
  Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic programming 
  Non-monotonic logics, default logics, conditional logics 
  Preferences: modeling and representation, preference-based reasoning 
  Reasoning about knowledge and belief, dynamic epistemic logic epistemic and doxastic logics 
  Reasoning systems and solvers, knowledge compilation 
  Spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning, qualitative reasoning 
  Uncertainty, representations of vagueness, many-valued and fuzzy logics 
   Submissions  
 We would like to invite authors to submit papers on research on KRR area, with particular emphasis on assessing the current state of the art and identifying future directions.

 The topic of the track covers an important field of research in Artificial Intelligence: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning ( KRR  ) is indeed a trending topic, with its subfield of Argumentation theory gaining significant attention. The KRR  track serves as a venue for researchers and practitioners working on the fundamentals and applications of reasoning, fostering cross-fertilization among different approaches such as Argumentation and Belief Revision.  
 KRR  is a crucial area of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations to capture information about the world, enabling the solution of complex problems. The primary goal is to understand and construct intelligent behaviour from a top-down perspective, determining what an agent needs to know to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be symbolically represented, and how automated reasoning procedures can utilise this knowledge effectively. A fundamental assumption in KRR  is that an agent's knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. Topics of interest include argumentation, constraint solving, programming, technologies, belief revision and update, belief merging, commonsense reasoning, contextual reasoning, description logics, diagnosis, abduction, explanation, inconsistency- and exception-tolerant reasoning, para-consistent logics, KR and autonomous agents (intelligent agents, cognitive robotics, multi-agent systems), KR and decision making (game theory, social choice), KR and machine learning (inductive logic programming, knowledge discovery and acquisition), logic programming (answer set programming, constraint logic programming), non-monotonic logics (default logics, conditional logics), preferences (modelling and representation, preference-based reasoning), reasoning about knowledge and belief (dynamic epistemic logic, epistemic and doxastic logics), reasoning systems and solvers, knowledge compilation, spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning (qualitative reasoning), uncertainty, and representations of vagueness (many-valued and fuzzy logics).  
 The KRR  track has been a significant part of the SAC conference for several years, showcasing cutting-edge research and developments in this field. Below is a list of the editions of KRR  :

 Intelligent  Decision  T  echnologies:   
 An  International  Journal  (IDT)  enters  its  16th   
 year:  A  short  note  from  the  editors   
 George  A.  Tsihrintzis,  Gloria  Phillips-Wren,  Lakhmi  C  Jain  and  Junzo  W  atada   
 Intelligent  Decision  T  echnologies  (IDT):  An  Inter-   
 national  Journal  (https://www  .iospress.com/catalog/    
 journals/intelligent-decision-technologies)  is  dedicated   
 to  the  advancement  and  dissemination  of  research  re-   
 sults  and  knowledge  in  the  theory  and  application  of   
 intelligent  technologies  and  systems  in  support  of  de-   
 cision  making.  The  IDT  Journal  is  afﬁliated  with  KES   
 International  (http://www.k  esinternational.org/),  “a  pro-   
 fessional  community,  with  networking,  research  and   
 publication  opportunities  for  all  those  who  work  in   
 knowledge-intensive  subjects”.  KES  sponsors  interna-   
 tional  conferences  on  leading-edge  topics,  including  an   
 annual  conference  for  Intelligent  Decision  Technolo-   
 gies.   
 The  idea  of  the  IDT  Journal  originated  through  dis-   
 cussions  between  Professor/Dr.  Gloria  Phillips-Wren   
 and  Professor/Dr.  Lakhmi  C.  Jain  at  the  Kno  wledge   
 Engineering  Systems  (KES)  International  annual  con-   
 ferences  in  the  timeframe  of  2004–2006.  The  spark  that   
 at  the  time  inspired  the  two  Professors  to  initiate  the   
 IDT  Journal  lay  in  the  fact  that,  while  research  mainly   
 focused  on  algorithms  and  technical  speciﬁcations,  the   
 technology  was  also  becoming  mature  enough  to  be   
 implemented  into  real-world  decision  support  systems   
 (DSS)  for  previously  intractable  problems.   
 Thus,  the  IDT  Journal  was  launched  in  2007.   
 Profs./Drs.  Lakhmi  C.  Jain  and  Gloria  Phillips-Wren   
 introduced  the  IDT  Journal  to  the  research  community   
 with  an  editorial  note  stating  that  “ The  purpose  of  this    
 peer  reviewed,  sc  holarly  journal  is  to  develop  a  forum   
 for  theoretical  and  applied  resear  ch  that  combines  ar-   
 tiﬁcial  intelligence  based  in  computer  science,  deci-   
 sion  support  based  in  information  technology  ,  and  sys-   
 tems  development  based  in  engineering  science.  Inter-   
 disciplinary  advances  in  these  ﬁelds  have  the  poten-   
 tial  to  signiﬁcantly  improve  individual  and  or  ganiza-   
 tional  decision  making.  The  growth  of  the  internet  with   
 its  concomitant  availability  of  data  has  exploded  the   
 amount  and  types  of  information  that  must  be  consid-   
 ered  by  a  decision  maker  .  Decisions  must  often  be  made   
 in  real-time  under  uncertain,  stressful  conditions  that   
 may  change  rapidly  .  Synergies  between  intelligent  and   
 information  technologies  can,  for  example,  deliver  arti-   
 ﬁcial  intelligence  to  enhance  human  judgment,  perceive   
 anomalies  in  data,  enable  collaboration,  speed  process-   
 ing  of  new  information,  assist  in  risk  assessment,  iden-   
 tify  and  retrieve  needed  knowledge,  sug  gest  alternatives   
 to  the  decision  maker  ,  and  automate  some  decisional   
 tasks.  W  e  look  forward  to  the  dialogue  within  this  com-   
 munity  and  welcome  your  resear  ch  for  publication ”  [1].    
 Since  its  launch,  the  IDT  Journal  is  in  continuous   
 circulation  with  a  new  issue  published  quarterly  by   
 IOS  Press  (https://www.iospress.com/)  headquartered   
 in  Amsterdam,  the  Netherlands.  At  the  same  time,  the   
 ﬁeld  of  intelligent  decision  support  has  been  enjoying   
 continuous  and  rapid  expansion  in  theory  ,  paradigms   
 and  real-world  systems  and  applications.  This  expan-   
 sion  is  due  to  parallel  advances  and  efﬁciencies  in  such   
 enabling  technologies  as  (1)  Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  (AI);   
 (2)  connectivity  between  devices  such  as  the  Inter-   
 net  of  Things  (IoT);  (3)  data  storage,  processing  and   
 transmission  in  distributed,  virtualized  and  network-   
 centric  environments  (e.g.  cloud  technologies);  (4)  re-   
 markable  computer  and  internet  transmission  speeds;

 Among the primary aims of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the enhancement of User Experience (UX) by providing deep understanding, profound empathy, tailored assistance, useful recommendations, and natural communication with human interactants while they are achieving their goals through computer use. To this end, AI is used in varying techniques to automate sophisticated functions in UX and thereby changing what UX is apprehended by the users. This is achieved through the development of intelligent interactive systems such as virtual assistants, recommender systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. The changes are well received, as technological achievements but create new challenges of trust, explainability and usability to humans, which in turn need to be amended by further advancements of AI in reciprocity. AI can be utilised to enhance the UX of a system while the quality of the UX can influence the effectiveness of AI. The state of the art in AI for UX is constantly evolving, with a growing focus on designing transparent, explainable, and fair AI systems that prioritise user control and autonomy, protect user data privacy and security, and promote diversity and inclusivity in the design process. Staying up to date with the latest advancements and best practices in this field is crucial. This paper conducts a critical analysis of published academic works and research studies related to AI and UX, exploring their interrelationship and the cause-effect cycle between the two. Ultimately, best practices for achieving a successful interrelationship of AI in UX are identified and listed based on established methods or techniques that have been proven to be effective in previous research reviewed.

  Production efficiency, good paper profiles, reduced energy consumption and cost savings are common targets for all paper makers. Besides these, also providing the best possible customer satisfaction for end product users is crucial on today’s demanding markets. Intelligent roll – “iRoll” product family aims at these goals and provides a solution for improving sheet quality, optimizing nip ... [Show full abstract]  profiles and for assuring highest possible end product runnability. The intelligent “iRoll” product family is a complete set of tools for controlling paper tension and nip profiles. Intelligent rolls can be utilized for all main processes and positions of paper machines. “iRoll” technology enables to improve production efficiency and product quality by assuring optimal runnability in all process phases. Use of intelligent roll technology offers cost savings by improved nip profiles, parent roll hardness profiles and tension profiles as well as best possible product for printing and converting houses. This paper introduces the applications of intelligent roll technology in paper, board and tissue making and illustrates the benefits through example cases.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”

 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 About Us  
 The importance of studying knowledge science, knowledge engineering and knowledge management has been recognized widely. We could cite Feigenbaum’s words in his book The fifth generation, Artificial Intelligence and Japan’s Computer challenge to the World, for demonstrating the point:  
 “Knowledge is not the same as information. Knowledge is Information that has been pared, shaped, interpreted, selected, and transformed” 
  “Knowledge is power, and the computer is an amplifier of that power. We are now at the dawn of a new computer revolution…the transition from information processing to knowledge processing” 
  “…establish a ‘knowledge industry’ in which knowledge itself will be a salable commodity like food and oil. Knowledge itself is to become the wealth of nations”. 

 Our Aim  
 Making available information about KSEM conferences among people who are interested in it. 
  Serving as a representative forum for experts within the KSEM related field. 
  Distributing KSEM related information and knowledge, e.g papers, projects, news, discussions and even blogs

 KSEM General Guidelines and Policies  
 For the KSEM conference series, we are committed to promoting ethical behavior, diversity, and fairness in all aspects of our conference. Our policies aim to establish a premier research conference in knowledge science, engineering, and management.  
  
 Ethics  
 All attendees, including authors, speakers, organizers, and participants, are expected to conduct themselves in an ethical manner that respects the dignity and rights of all individuals. This includes avoiding any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying based on personal characteristics, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, or disability. In addition, all participants are expected to adhere to ethical standards in their research, including obtaining appropriate informed consent and ensuring the ethical use of data.  
 Diversity  
 We believe that diversity is essential for advancing AI research and fostering innovation in the field. Therefore, we strive to create a conference that represents a diverse range of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. This includes inviting speakers and organizers from different countries and encouraging submissions on emerging topics in the field. We also prioritize the inclusion of diverse perspectives and viewpoints in our program and discussions.  
 Bidding of KSEM Hosting  
 Organizations interested in hosting the KSEM conference are required to submit the bidding documents to the KSEM steering committee chair, no later than two months prior to that year's KSEM conference. The bidding document needs to cover the following aspects:  
 Venue and Hosting Organization 
  Facilities and Accommodation 
  Proposed Organization Committee 
  Experience in Hosting International Conferences 
  Strategies for Organizing KSEM 
  Recommended Schedules/Milestones 
   
 Conference Chair Designation  
 The KSEM conference general chair is responsible for overseeing the overall conference and ensuring that it aligns with our policies and values. We select our general chair based on their experience, leadership skills, and commitment to promoting ethical behavior and diversity in the field. The general chair is responsible for upholding our policies and values, as well as ensuring that the conference is inclusive and welcoming to all attendees.  
 KSEM program committee chairs are designated based on their academic leadership, expertise, experience, and commitment to promoting ethical behavior and diversity in the field. We expect our program chairs to prioritize diversity in their selection of keynote speakers and accepted papers, as well as in the overall program design. Additionally, program committee chairs are expected to facilitate open and respectful discussions and ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to contribute and engage.

 16  participants max.    

 3  days    

 2  experienced trainers    

 Do you want to learn how visual thinking...  
 Offers you an effective method to make complex and abstract information simpler and more understandable? 
  Ensures you communicate more effectively through clear, visual stories that are remembered? 
  Encourages faster decision-making and better collaboration by visualising the heart of the problem? 

 What are we going to do?  
 In this interactive 3-day training course, we teach you the principles of ‘Visual Design Thinking’. Not only the basics of drawing  are covered, but also the approach to get from complexity to a clear, logical visual story  .  
 We focus on the visual basics, creating an image bank  and listing information  . Afterwards, we will work with our own case study that we use to delve deeper into structuring your story and making it communicable. In between, there is plenty of room to work on your own case  and you will receive plenty of feedback from our trainers. You conclude the training with your own visualization  !  

 This is what the programme looks like  

 Day 1  
 We start by teaching you the basic shapes you can use to build a drawing, and we practice visualizing abstract words. You'll create your first imagebank.  

 Day 2  
 You begin by identifying the building blocks of your case and working out the structure. You arrive at a first sketch.  

 Day 3  
 You start working on techniques to increase readability under the guidance of our Visual Designers. We'll present the endresults to each other.  

 Is this for you?  
 The Summer of Winter School is designed for (individual) professionals, who want to learn how to use visual thinking and drawing in a business context. Even if you have no drawing experience yet  , you can join! The group consists of a maximum of 16 participants and our trainings are always led by 2 experienced trainers and visual consultants.  

 After training you...  
 Have the confidence to start drawing more in your work. 
  Have a first version of your own image bank. 
  Can use visual thinking to accelerate your (team) work. 
  Go home with inspiration and energy to get started with your new drawing tools. 
  Take your own Flatland drawing kit with you. 

 ''With the help of the Flatland Academy, I now have the foundation to dare to draw and the tools to turn it into a gripping story.''

 Are you there? The facts at a glance:  
 Date: | Our next Winter School will take place in late January or early February 2025. | Subject to sufficient registrations | . 
  Investment | : 3 days for €1,895 excluding VAT (21%). Includes materials during the day, such as a cheat sheet and your own drawing kit to bring along, and of course lunch and drinks. 
  Bonus | : after the training there is a free reflection moment, to further develop your skills with our consultants by working on a case together.

   KES-AMSTA 2025 conference   
  
 We participate at the 18th International KES Conference on AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS  , KES-AMSTA-25. KES-AMSTA is an international scientific conference for research in the field of agent and multi-agent systems. Agents and multi-agent systems are related to a modern software paradigm which has long been recognized as a promising technology for constructing autonomous, complex and intelligent systems. Consisting of keynote talks by experts in the field, oral and poster presentations, AMSTA-24 will provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to discuss modern approaches and techniques for agent and multi-agent systems and their applications, as well as intelligent systems in the field of social networks, self-organisation and trust.  
 Proceedings    
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer as book chapters in a volume of the KES Smart Innovation Systems and Technologies series, submitted for indexing in Scopus and Thomson-Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) and the Web of Science.  
 Smart Digital Futures  
 Smart Digital Futures  2024 is a multi-conference event co-locating five conferences on leading edge smart systems topics in a beautiful location. One conference fee gives you entry to six high-quality conferences on Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare, Human Centred Intelligent Systems, Intelligent Decision Technologies, Intelligent Interactive Multimedia Systems and Services, Agent and Multi-agent Systems, Smart Transportation Systems and Smart Education and E-Learning, and a paper published in one set of proceedings.  
 The event will take place in Solin, Croatia. More information could be found at the conference website http://amsta-25.kesinternational.org/   
 Invited sessions on "AGENT-BASED MODELING AND SIMULATION (ABMS)"  
 As usual we are also organizing an invited session on "AGENT-BASED MODELING AND SIMULATION (ABMS)". Computational social science involves the use of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) to study complex social systems. ABMS consists of a set of agents and a framework for simulating their decisions and interactions. ABMS is related to a variety of other simulation techniques, including discrete event simulation and distributed artificial intelligence or multi-agent systems. Although many traits are shared, ABMS is differentiated from these approaches by its focus on finding the set of basic decision rules and behavioral interactions that can produce the complex results experienced in the real world. An agent is thus a software representation of a decision-making unit. Agents are self-directed objects with specific traits and typically exhibit bounded rationality, that is, they make decisions by using limited internal decision rules that depend only on imperfect local information. In practice, each agent has only partial knowledge of other agents and each agent makes its own decisions based on the partial knowledge about other agents in the system. We welcome all kinds of papers discussing aforementioned approaches from different domains in this section. We look forward to getting an attractive discussion in Solin 2025.  
 More information could be found at the conference website in a "Invited sessions" section http://amsta-25.kesinternational.org/cmsISdisplay.php
