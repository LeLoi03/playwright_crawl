2. Conference DBSEC_1:
IFIP WG 11.3   
 Working Group on Data and Applications Security and Privacy   

 Introduction  
 Welcome to the home page for IFIP WG 11.3 Working Group on Data and Applications Security and Privacy. IFIP WG 11.3 was formed in 1986 to stimulate activities in both data security and privacy research and in the application of data security and privacy techniques. The goal in forming the working group was to encourage the development of better techniques for stating data security and privacy requirements, for designing, building, and implementing data management systems that satisfy security and privacy requirements, and for assuring that the systems meet their requirements in actual operation.  
 WG 11.3 draws its members from both the computer security, privacy, and the data management systems research communities in order to produce solutions to data security and privacy problems that are of practical significance. ( see membership rules  )  
 WG 11.3 holds annual conferences that are open to the larger data security and privacy research community. These working conferences are structured so to allow ample time for discussion of relevant topics. The conference proceedings are published by Springer under the LNCS series  .  
 Aim and Scope of the Group  
 The aim and scope of the IFIP WG11.3 group is  
 To advance technologies that support: | the statement of security and privacy requirements for data management systems; 
  the design, implementation, and operation of data management systems that include security and privacy functions; and 
  the assurance that implemented data management systems meet their security and privacy requirements. 
  To promote wider understanding of the risks to society of operating data management systems that lack adequate measures for security or privacy. 
  To encourage the application of existing technologies for enhancing the security and privacy of data management systems.

 Paper Submissions  
 Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages in the LNCS format excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices, with a maximum of 20 pages in total. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and therefore the paper should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English, and only PDF files will be accepted (a Latex source file will be required for the final version of the accepted papers). The final version of the accepted papers must be in the format required for publications in the LNCS series. Papers that fail to comply with these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Submissions are to be made to the submission web site at the following  link  .  
 Every submission requires both an abstract submission and a corresponding paper submission. Abstracts must be submitted by March 31, 2023 (AoE)  April 7, 2023 (AoE)  and papers must be submitted by April 7, 2023 (AoE)  April 14, 2023 (AoE).  Accepted papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. A paper submitted to DBSec 2023 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the time it is being considered for DBSec 2023. Furthermore, after you submit to DBSec 2023, you must await our response before submitting elsewhere. If you submit your paper to another conference or journal either before/after submission of the paper to DBSec 2023, the paper will be rejected without review and the other conference/journal will be notified as well. This restriction applies to identical as well as to substantially similar papers.  
   The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  series.  
 DBSec 2023 will have best paper and best student paper awards. Outstanding papers will be invited for possible publication in a special issue of the Journal of Computer Security.

 Announcing OpenWEMI  
 In 1998, the International Federation of Library Associations introduced a new model for library catalog data, focusing on the bibliographic relationships within metadata. This model, known as the Library Reference Model (LRM), includes four main elements: Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item (WEMI), each representing different aspects of created resources. To support the broader use of these WEMI concepts, OpenWEMI was developed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, providing a general vocabulary with minimal constraints. OpenWEMI’s RDF vocabulary includes classes and properties designed to facilitate the creation of context-specific metadata vocabularies, allowing for the flexible integration of WEMI concepts in diverse applications.

  Metadata Basics 

 Metadata Basics  

 A brief introduction to DCMI by Tom Baker as presented at the DCMI Virtual 2021 conference, 4 October 2021 ( YouTube  ).  
  
 Metadata  , literally "data about data" -- specifically, descriptive metadata  -- is structured data about anything that can be named, such as Web pages, books, journal articles, images, songs, products, processes, people (and their activities), research data, concepts, and services. Now a mainstream concept, metadata  first trended in 1995, closely following World Wide Web  in 1994. ("Big data" metadata about actions and transactions such as Facebook likes, phone calls, tweets, and the like, which trended in 2013, is out of scope for this brief introduction.)  
 Dublin Core™ metadata  , or perhaps more accurately metadata "in the Dublin Core™ style", is metadata designed for interoperability on the basis of Semantic Web  or Linked Data  principles. Metadata in this style uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as global identifiers both for the things described by the metadata and for the terms used to describe them ( vocabularies  ). This style is distinguished by the application profile   -- a specification detailing how well-known generic vocabularies such as the Dublin Core  are used, constrained, or combined with more specialized vocabularies to meet the requirements of specific applications. Application profiles have been the focus of the Dublin Core™ community since they first trended in 2000.  
 From Catalog Records to Linked Data  
 The Dublin Core   , a set of fifteen generic, widely used elements -- Creator, Contributor, Publisher, Title, Date, Language, Format, Subject, Description, Identifier, Relation, Source, Type, Coverage, and Rights -- was first drafted at a 1995 meeting in Dublin, Ohio, initially to facilitate information discovery on an explosively growing Web by embedding simple, card-catalog-like metadata in its pages. A diverse community of librarians, technologists, and researchers rallied to the idea, pursued and refined through a series of lively workshops and conferences, of achieving rough interoperability across languages and disciplines through a core of shared semantics. Successive developments in Web technology pulled this community in two directions:  
 Metadata based on record formats.  Mainstream developers have used, and continue to use, vocabularies such as Dublin Core™ in the context of relational databases and repositories, many of which are based on XML, an Extensible Markup Language for specifying the contents of metadata records as structured documents. Implementers of record formats favor text values, closed-world quality control, top-down conformance, and reliance on well-understood, tried-and-true software solutions. Interoperability across applications is seen in terms of adherence to fixed formats such as the fifteen-element Simple Dublin Core™ and Qualified Dublin Core™ (2003), with several dozen additional DCMI metadata terms, to dozens of other formats published over the years. While the record-based approach may be relatively easy to deploy, interoperability across differently structured formats relies on ad-hoc "crosswalks" (mappings) that are hard to maintain and to use.  
 Metadata based on recombinant statements.  Starting in the late 1990s, working groups of the World Wide Web Consortium pursued the vision of a web of data, or Semantic Web. This vision was enabled by Resource Description Framework (RDF)  and by a global Domain Name System (DNS) that could resolve URIs to resources on the Web. The first W3C Recommendation for RDF in 1999  featured annotated examples of metadata using Dublin Core, which in 2000 became one of the first vocabularies to be published in RDF with persistent URIs  . In the face of the messiness and complexities of the open Web, RDF implementers aim at achieving partial interoperability. In the RDF mindset, metadata consisted not of discrete, bounded records (documents) of a known structure, but of unbounded, schema-less graphs  composed of atomic statements  that could be recombined, or "mashed up", by merging multiple sources into the graph. In statement-based metadata, interoperability among multiple sources results from using, or mapping to, shared URIs, preferably from well-known vocabularies such as Dublin Core™.  
 Dublin Core-style application profiles.  Where XML implementers saw application profiles as blueprints for creating validatable metadata records within a specific application, RDF implementers saw profiles as a basis for designing metadata that would compatibly fit into data graphs spanning multiple applications. To bridge this gap, DCMI's Singapore Framework (2007)  the ideal application profile as the sum of several best-practice design components. At its core was the notion of a description  as a set of statements about a single resource. Descriptions of multiple resources, such as Book and Author, could be bundled into a description set  which, in turn, could either be stored directly as an RDF graph or encoded in a format designed to be convertible into RDF. A well-designed application profile would be based on available RDF vocabularies, well-articulated entity models, and explicitly defined functional requirements. Metadata in this style need not be based on the Dublin Core™ but can draw on a diversity of RDF vocabularies, such as Friend of a Friend ( FOAF  )  , the Bibliographic Ontology ( BIBO  )  , and Schema.org   .  
 Linked-Data-compatible metadata today  
 The uptake of metadata, and specifically of metadata based on RDF vocabularies, has been propelled by the evolution of technology:  
 Support for creating metadata. | Modern software platforms, such as the Drupal content management system and Hugo static website generator use metadata to structure the content and presentation of websites. Some can also be configured to publish Linked Data, either by embedding it in Web pages or by generating metadata feeds in Linked Data-compatible syntaxes. 
  Support for querying metadata. | Repositories of Linked Data can be queried in the manner of relational databases by using a standard query language, | SPARQL | . This can be facilitated a | SPARQL endpoint | that accepts queries and returns results over the Web. 
  Support for indexing embedded metadata. | The 1995 vision of finding Web resources via embedded metadata first became mainstream in 2011, when Google, Bing, and Yahoo! announced support for | Schema.org | , which aimed at helping webmasters use embedded metadata to improve the presentation of their sites in search results. The major search engines now extract and index metadata embedded with one of several syntaxes: | HTML Microdata | , of limited expressivity but the easiest for webmasters to deploy; | RDFa | , a richer syntax with better support for internationalization and multiple RDF namespaces; and | JSON-LD | , an RDF-compatible variant of the popular Javascript Object Notation (JSON). These broadly supported syntaxes effectively obsolete a series of IETF and DCMI syntax specifications developed prior to 2008 specifically for expressing Dublin Core™ metadata. 
  Support for publishing value vocabularies as Linked Data. | The W3C standard | Simple Knowledge Organization System ( SKOS  ) | provides a core data model for sharing taxonomies and thesauri, such as | AGROVOC | , as Linked Data. Each concept in a | SKOS concept scheme | is identified with URI that is globally citable in metadata and can thus be used as a basis for linking, or merging, metadata from diverse sources. SKOS made it relatively easy to port a rich tradition of existing knowledge organization systems from printed books, siloed databases, and PDFs to the Semantic Web. The rapid uptake of SKOS in the library and research worlds led to a broader acceptance of RDF as a mainstream solution for interoperability. 
  Support for collaborative metadata creation. | Wikidata | , a collaboratively edited knowledge base used as a source of structured open data by Wikipedia, and its open-source platform Wikibase, have made it easier to create and maintain metadata by crowdsourcing. 
  Support for validating RDF metadata. | The | Shape Expressions language ( ShEx  ) | and the related | Shapes Constraint Language ( SHACL  ) | now provide the ability to treat RDF graphs as objects of closed-world conformance validation in the manner of XML schemas. Application profiles can now be expressed as ShEx schemas, with domain entities modeled as ShEx shapes. Further work in the DCMI community will aim at making it easier for non-expert users to create validation schemas using familiar tools such as spreadsheets. 
  DCMI's Linked Data Competency Index  breaks down many of these areas into sets of skills and concepts ("competencies") usable by teachers, trainers, professors, or independent learners in designing courses or for self-directed study.  
 Metadata in the Second Machine Age  
 In his keynote talk at DC-2016  , Bradley Allen discussed the role of metadata in the Second Machine Age. "While the user experience of discovery has come to be dominated by search engines such as Google," he noted, "metadata standards are pervasive in the infrastructure of content curation and management, and underpin search infrastructure". In his view, a single thread runs from the establishment of the Dublin Core™ through Open Linked Data to the emergence of Knowledge Graphs -- graph-structured databases extracted from content with the help of machine intelligence not only for helping people find, filter, and organize information, but also for constructing answers to questions. In his vision, the design of metadata should evolve in ways that can help machines read and learn from the Web and, in turn, help make its resources easier for both machines and people to discover and use.

  Section 1: Introduction and Definitions  
 This document is an up-to-date, authoritative specification of all metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core™ Metadata Initiative. Included are the fifteen terms of the Dublin Core™ Metadata Element Set (also known as "the Dublin Core") plus several dozen properties, classes, datatypes, and vocabulary encoding schemes. The "Dublin Core" plus these extension vocabularies are collectively referred to as "DCMI metadata terms" ("Dublin Core terms" for short). These terms are intended to be used in combination with metadata terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles.  
 DCMI metadata terms are expressed in RDF vocabularies for use in Linked Data. Creators of non-RDF metadata can use the terms in contexts such as XML, JSON, UML, or relational databases by disregarding both the global identifier and the formal implications of the RDF-specific aspects of term definitions. Such users can take domain, range, subproperty, and subclass relations as usage suggestions and focus on the natural-language text of definitions, usage notes, and examples.  
 Each term is identified with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a global identifier usable in Linked Data. Term URIs resolve to the ( DCMI Metadata Terms  ) document when selected in a browser or, when referenced programmatically by RDF applications, to one of four RDF schemas  . The scope of each RDF schema corresponds to a "DCMI namespace", or set of DCMI metadata terms that are identified using a common base URI, as enumerated in the DCMI Namespace Policy  . In Linked Data, the URIs for DCMI namespaces are often declared as prefixes in order to make data, queries, and schemas more concise and readable.  
 The four DCMI namespaces are:  
 http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ | The | /elements/1.1/ | namespace was created in 2000 for the RDF representation of the fifteen-element Dublin Core and has been widely used in data for more than twenty years. This namespace corresponds to the original scope of ISO 15836, which was published first in 2003 and last revised in 2017 as ISO 15836-1:2017 [ | ISO 15836-1:2017 | . 
  http://purl.org/dc/terms/ | The | /terms/ | namespace was originally created in 2001 for identifying new terms coined outside of the original fifteen-element Dublin Core. In 2008, in the context of defining formal semantic constraints for DCMI metadata terms in support of RDF applications, the original fifteen elements themselves were mirrored in the | /terms/ | namespace. As a result, there exists both a | dc:date | ( | http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date | ) with no formal range and a corresponding | dcterms:date | ( | http://purl.org/dc/terms/date | ) with a formal range of "literal". While these distinctions are significant for creators of RDF applications, most users can safely treat the fifteen parallel properties as equivalent. The most useful properties and classes of DCMI Metadata Terms have now been published as ISO 15836-2:2019 [ | ISO 15836-2:2019 | ]. While the | /elements/1.1/ | namespace will be supported indefinitely, DCMI gently encourages use of the | /terms/ | namespace. 
  http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/ | The | /dcmitype/ | namespace was created in 2001 for the DCMI Type Vocabulary, which defines classes for basic types of thing that can be described using DCMI metadata terms. 
  http://purl.org/dc/dcam/ | The | /dcam/ | namespace was created in 2008 for terms used in the | description of | DCMI metadata terms. 
  Each term is specified with the following minimal set of attributes:  
  
 Name: | A token appended to the URI of a DCMI namespace to create the URI of the term. 
 Label: | The human-readable label assigned to the term. 
 URI: | The Uniform Resource Identifier used to uniquely identify a term. 
 Definition: | A statement that represents the concept and essential nature of the term. 
 Type of Term: | The type of term: property, class, datatype, or vocabulary encoding scheme. 

  Where applicable, the following attributes provide additional information about a term:  
  
 Comment: | Additional information about the term or its application. 
 See: | Authoritative documentation related to the term. 
 Subproperty Of: | A property of which the described term is a sub-property. 
 Superclass Of: | A class of which the described term is a super-class. 
 Subclass Of: | A class of which the described term is a sub-class. 
 Domain: | A class of which a resource described by the term is an instance. 
 Domain Includes: | A suggested class for subjects of this property. 
 Range: | A class of which a value described by the term is an instance. 
 Range Includes: | A suggested class for values of this property. 
 Member Of: | An enumerated set of resources (Vocabulary Encoding Scheme) of which the term is a member. 
 Instance Of: | A class of which the described term is an instance. 
 Equivalent  
  Property: | A property to which the described term is equivalent.

 Title: Exploring Modalities in Machine Learning   
  Abstract:  A multi-modal deep learning model can process and interpret multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. These models are significantly closer to human cognition capability when perceiving the world. Let A, B, and C be three modalities. They may interact with each other during model training. Recent researches have made success in several types of modality interactions: (1) alignment of modality A and modality B, denoted as A~B, (2) conversion from modality A to modality B, denoted as A →  B, (3) merging a model of A and a model of B into a larger model C, denoted as AUB=C, (4) inject a new modality C into two existing modalities A and B, denoted as A+B →  C, (5) transferring the calculus on modality A to modality B, denoted as A →  (+, -, *, /) →  B, (6) producing a secondary modality A’ from A, denoted as A →  A’, and (7) stacking two modalities A and B, denoted as A//B. We will illustrate several examples for the above interaction types. Understanding these may help develop new researches.

 Title: Toward 6G-Enabled Mobile Edge Intelligence   
  Abstract:  With the explosive development of AI, edge intelligence has been considered a must in developing future 6G mobile communications systems to provide timely responses to emerging applications on mobile devices. In 6G, the computation-intensive AI tasks will be distributed at the network edge, and the communications paradigm will shift from conventional symbol transmission to semantic information delivery. This lecture will overview key features of 6G mobile networks and elaborate on distributed AI learning driven by edge intelligence. We will present the effects of limited labeled and non-IID data in the edge-intelligence environment. We will also discuss the vulnerability of the edge-intelligence framework and defense methods against privacy leakage and security threats. Finally, we will introduce the GenAI-based semantic encoder to prioritize task-oriented communication, with the concept of understanding before transmitting and delivering the intended meaning of messages, to achieve the goal of pervasive computing for connected intelligence.

 Inhalt  

 This book presents applications of innovative techniques for studying and solving complex problems in artificial intelligence and computing. This edition brings together experience, current work, and promising future trends related to distributed computing, artificial intelligence, and their applications to provide efficient solutions to real-world problems. Given the conference's success, this edition features twelve special sessions covering a wide range of topics related to AI and other areas of interest. These sessions were carefully curated to address the latest advancements and challenges in fields such as machine learning, neural networks, IoT, big data, and blockchain, among others. The accepted papers from these sessions are presented in two volumes, showcasing the diverse and innovative research being conducted in these domains. This is the first volume, which includes the sessions: Artificial intelligence for enhanced cyber security (AI4CS), AI-driven methods for multimodal networks and processes modeling (AIMPM), computational linguistics, information, reasoning, and AI (CLIRAI), novel technologies for smart industry and mobility (SmartMob), intelligent Internet of things security and privacy (WISP) and revolutionizing carbon farming by nature-based business models and emerging innovations in the field of artificial intelligence, satellite and green technologies (INNO4CFIS), each focusing on specific themes within the broader scope of AI and its applications. The DCAI’24 technical program has selected 74 papers in special sessions and, as in past editions, it will be special issues in ranked journals. This symposium is organized by the University of Salamanca (Spain). The authors would like to thank all the contributing authors, the program committee members, national associations (AEPIA, APPIA, LASI), and the sponsors (AIR Institute).

 The 21 st  Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025)   
 Tuscany (Lucca), Italy   
 June 9 to 11, 2025   
 * The DCOSS-IoT series of events are always technically co-sponsored by IEEE, and Proceedings are published by IEEE Xplore.  
 The 21 st  International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will be held in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference is always co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and by the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP).  
 The conference was previously known as DCOSS. Starting in 2023, the event is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to include smart systems in general and the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT).   
 In the last few years, we have witnessed significant growth in the use of IoT and distributed sensor systems in several application areas, including smart transportation, smart energy systems, smart homes and buildings, smart healthcare, and environmental monitoring. For smart sensor systems to truly become useful and pervasive, we need to address several research challenges, including the tight integration of sensing and machine intelligence, reliable and efficient networking, interoperability and scalability, the need for dependable autonomy, interaction with humans, and important aspects of security, privacy and trust. DCOSS-IoT focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack, covering aspects of high-level abstractions, models and languages, communication technologies, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, and tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating recent advances in theoretical and experimental research.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:   
 Artificial Intelligence for IoT 
  Machine learning and data mining for IoT and Smart Systems 
  Smart healthcare to combat epidemics 
  Edge and fog computing: distributed computing models from sensor to cloud 
  Machine intelligence in distributed sensor systems and real-time analytics 
  Novel communication paradigms (e.g., 5G/6G, VLC, DSA) for IoT and Smart Systems 
  Cyber-Physical Systems 
  IoT and Smart Systems for Smart and Connected Communities 
  Autonomous systems: closing the loop between sensing and actuation 
  Time and location management 
  Robustness, resilience, and dependability of IoT and smart systems 
  Security and privacy in IoT and Smart Systems 
  Performance analysis: complexity, correctness, scalability 
  Mobile and human-centric sensing 
  IoT and Smart Systems for social computing 
  Interoperability, heterogeneity and scalability 
  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing/communications/networking 
  Social sensing and crowd sensing techniques, applications, and systems 
  Complex systems comprising wearable, robotic and/or fixed sensor systems 
  IoT and Smart Systems for emerging and developing economies 
  Green and environmentally friendly IoT (low power, harvesting, energy management) 
  Sensors and Robots for Internet of Intelligent Things 
  Design and implementation of real-world applications and systems 
  Approaches, tools, and experience of deployment and operation 
  Interdisciplinary applications of IoT and Smart Systems 
  Smart healthcare and digital epidemiology 
  Smart agriculture 
  Smart infrastructures 
  Smart cities 
  Smart energy, transportation, and water distribution systems 
  Smart factories 
  Smart workspace 
  Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating current research on distributed smart systems and IoT related to the aforementioned topics  of interest. Please use the US letter size (8.5 X 11 in) standard IEEE conference LaTeX format or Microsoft Word template available on: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html  .  
 All submissions should be written in English and have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages, including figures and references. Two (2) additional pages at 100$/page for supplementary material only (such as theorems, proofs, implementation details) are allowed. Starting 2023, DCOSS-IoT follows a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the EDAS submission system.  
 *** Special Issue and Best Paper Awards ***   
 DCOSS-IoT 2025 will announce a best paper award and a best poster/demo award.  
 Extended versions of selected best papers from DCOSS-IoT 2025 will be included in a Special Issue of the Computer Networks (COMNET) Journal.  
 *** Important dates ***   
 Abstract Registration Deadline: January 20, 2025 
  Paper Submission Deadline: January 27, 2025

  DCOSS 2020 is the 16th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems to be hosted in Los Angeles, California, USA, in June 25-27, 2020. In the last few years, we have witnessed a significant growth in the use of IoT and distributed sensor systems in a number of application areas, ranging from smart transport, energy and buildings, to factory automation, smart healthcare and environmental monitoring. In order for smart sensor systems to truly become useful and pervasive, we need to address a number of research challenges, including the tight integration of sensing and machine intelligence reliable and efficient networking, interoperability and scalability, the need for dependable autonomy interaction with humans, and important aspects of security, privacy and trust. DCOSS focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack: covering aspects of high-level abstractions models and languages, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, as well as tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original unpublished manuscripts that demonstrate recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
  Edge and fog computing: distributed computing models from sensor to cloud 
  Energy harvesting models and optimization 
  Machine intelligence in distributed sensor systems and real time analytics 
  Communication and networking primitives and protocols 
  Autonomy: closing the loop between sensing and actuation 
  Task allocation, reprogramming, and reconfiguration 
  Robustness, resilience and dependability 
  Security and privacy issues 
  Approaches, tools, and experience of deployment and operation

 The 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks   
 Naples, Italy, June 23-26, 2025  

 Welcome   
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025), organized by Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia.  
 DSN 2025 will be held in Naples, Italy from 23 to 26 June 2025. Naples, an enchanting city of sea and culture. Naples was founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. Naples is the capital of Campania lies in the bay of the same name next to the volcano Vesuvius and offers a spectacular view as far as the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida. Naples' historic city center is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties, such as Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, and Vesuvius. Neapolitan cuisine is noted for its association with pizza, which originated in the city, as well as numerous other local dishes.  
 We look forward to meeting you in Naples!!!

 Tuscany (Lucca), Italy   
 June 9 to 11, 2025   
 * The DCOSS-IoT series of events are always technically co-sponsored by IEEE, and Proceedings are published by IEEE Xplore.  
 The 21 st  International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will be held in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference is always co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and by the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP).  
 The conference was previously known as DCOSS. Starting in 2023, the event is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to include smart systems in general and the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT).   
 In the last few years, we have witnessed significant growth in the use of IoT and distributed sensor systems in several application areas, including smart transportation, smart energy systems, smart homes and buildings, smart healthcare, and environmental monitoring. For smart sensor systems to truly become useful and pervasive, we need to address several research challenges, including the tight integration of sensing and machine intelligence, reliable and efficient networking, interoperability and scalability, the need for dependable autonomy, interaction with humans, and important aspects of security, privacy and trust. DCOSS-IoT focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack, covering aspects of high-level abstractions, models and languages, communication technologies, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, and tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating recent advances in theoretical and experimental research.

 All submissions should be written in English and have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages, including figures and references. Two (2) additional pages at 100$/page for supplementary material only (such as theorems, proofs, implementation details) are allowed. Starting 2023, DCOSS-IoT follows a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the EDAS submission system.  
 *** Special Issue and Best Paper Awards ***   
 DCOSS-IoT 2025 will announce a best paper award and a best poster/demo award.  
 Extended versions of selected best papers from DCOSS-IoT 2025 will be included in a Special Issue of the Computer Networks (COMNET) Journal.

 International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering  

 Developments of eSystems Engineering (DeSE) has been established in recognition of the escalating importance and relevance of electronic media, applications and devices in our everyday work, home and commercial environments. These systems have often arisen as solutions to domain specific problems, addressing areas of social science, business studies, engineering, auto, health studies, computer science, communications, geo-systems and most other academic and vocational subject areas. Accordingly developments and innovations in e-systems engineering have appeared through sources appropriate to their subject area with little heed paid to the actual underlying science of engineering an e-system. Therefore, it is the intention of DeSE to provide the increasingly essential forum dedicated to discussing and reporting on developments in the field of e-systems engineering; including all relevant research and practical advancements.  
 The areas of interest will, by the nature of the subject, be very wide: The science behind e-systems engineering will be advanced through the integrated approach of specifically considering e-systems development with the added advantage of transferable experience and knowledge across all individual subject areas. As the technology advances and users become more familiar with e-systems the impact of these systems is likely to be felt in many areas:  
 In education there is vast scope for the introduction of advanced eLearning  tools allowing students/pupils an improved level of independent learning. 
  E-systems are often based on or are required to exhibit some form of Artificial Intelligence  (AI). AI techniques based on paradigms such as neural nets or expert systems will thus be relevant to and impact upon research into e-systems development. 
  In eBusiness  there is already a significant uptake of eSystems  by eCommerce  websites, which can only increase in future years with developments in ePayment  systems and newly developed models of commerce. Issues of trust, security and database design are typically studied within this area. 
  eServices  are becoming an important part of Web based computing with Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Software as a Service (SaS) seen as the future of computing. 
  We are proud to announce that the Applied Computing in Medicine and Health, 1st Edition is available to pre-order via the Elsevier Store from the link below.  
 http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780128034682   
  
 The authors of the book chapters are international researchers based in the UK and abroad from both academia and practitioners from medical institutions. The book can be used as teaching materials for undergraduate and postgraduate degree students, for students studying for a Computer Science Degree, Software Engineering and Health Informatics related subjects. Additionally, researchers can use the book as reference for their research and development in the field of AI and Health.

Selected high-quality papers, after revision and extension, will be invited to be published, in a special issue of Knowledge and Information Systems ( KAIS  ), Springer (IF=3.2), and Data & Knowledge Engineering ( DKE  ), Elsevier (IF=2.7).  
 Scope  
 Data engineering and data analytics have been important R&D areas for years, with applications in multiple sectors (e.g., finance, energy, manufacturing, health care, security), but there still exist unsolved research and technological issues. Data engineering techniques are widely applied to store and manage data. New types of highly heterogeneous data of large volumes (referred to as big data) created every second, require a continuous development of new techniques to handle these new types of data. On the one hand, more and more frequently, these techniques need to be supported by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, commonly called Artificial Intelligence (AI). These algorithms allow to provide solutions for difficult data management problems. Moreover, data science and data analytics rely on AI in the process of discovering dependency patterns, building complex prediction models, and processing natural language. On the other hand, data engineering techniques are indispensable for pre-processing data for AI. Thus, worlds of AI, data engineering, and data analytics are strongly interconnected.  
   
  Since 1990, DEXA has been an annual international conference which showcases state-of-the-art research activities in databases, data integration, advanced data anlytics, and knowledge systems. With the recent advances of big data and ML/AI DEXA covers these broad topics as well, to provide a forum to present research results and to examine advanced applications in the field. The conference and its associated workshops offer an opportunity for developers, scientists, and users to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in standard and just emerging research and technological topics on data and knowledge management.

 DEXA 2025 | conferences and workshops will be held in Bangkok, Thailand from 25 - 27 August 2025 
   
  Over three decades ago, Prof. Dr. Roland Wagner  and Prof. Dr. A Min Tjoa  recognized the need for an international platform to address the rapidly growing fields of Databases and Expert Systems Applications. This vision gave birth to DEXA, a conference that began as a small gathering of innovative minds in Austria. Today, DEXA has evolved into a global event, attracting more than 5,000 participants—including distinguished speakers, researchers, developers, and industry experts—from around the world.  
 DEXA Organization  
 DEXA is organized by the DEXA Society  , a non-profit association dedicated to advancing knowledge in the field of information technology. In 2019, the leadership of DEXA transitioned to a collaboration between the Web Applications Society  (@WAS), the Institute of Telecooperation  at Johannes Kepler University Linz, and the Software Competence Center Hagenberg  (SCCH). This new partnership continues to uphold the founding vision, bringing cutting-edge research and technological advancements to the forefront.  
 DEXA Conferences & Workshops

 The International Conferences and Workshops on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA)  , formerly the International Conference and Workshop(s) on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA) and the International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA), provides a forum for presenting research results in the area of database and intelligent systems and discussions on advanced applications and issues related to these areas. It will offer the opportunity to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in the field. The conference and associated workshops will inspire a fruitful dialogue between developers in practice, users of database and expert systems, and scientists working in the field.  
 Organizer: International Organization for Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (@WAS; short Web Applications Society), hosted by the Institute for Telecooperation (2019-present), and the DEXA Society /Association, hosted by the Institute for Application Oriented Knowledge Processing (1990-2018). Both are institutes of the Johannes Kepler University Linz.  
 Co-located relevant recurring conferences and workshops:  
 1999 – present: | International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK) | The International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery, formerly the International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK), has become one of the most important international scientific events to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss latest research issues and experiences in developing and deploying data warehousing and knowledge discovery systems, applications, and solutions. 
  2009 – 2022: | International Workshop on Biological Knowledge Discovery from Big Data (BIOKDD) | In the recent years, there has been a rapid development of biological technologies producing more and more biological data, i.e., data related to biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins). The rise of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, also known as high-throughput sequencing technologies, has contributed actively to the deluge of these data. In general, these data are big, heterogeneous, complex, and distributed in all over the world in databases. Analyzing biological big data is a challenging task, not only, because of its complexity and its multiple and numerous correlated factors, but also, because of the continuous evolution of our understanding of the biological mechanisms. Classical approaches of biological data analysis are no longer efficient and produce only a very limited amount of information, compared to the numerous and complex biological mechanisms under study. From here comes the necessity to adopt new computer tools and develop new in silico high performance approaches to support us in the analysis of biological big data and, hence, to help us in our understanding of the correlations that exist between, on one hand, structures and functional patterns in biological macromolecules and, on the other hand, genetic and biochemical mechanisms. Biological Knowledge Discovery from Big Data (BIOKDD), formerly the International Workshop on Biological Knowledge Discovery from Data and Data Mining, resp. (BIOKDD) is a response to these new trends. 
  2019 – 2022: | International Workshop on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs (MLKgraphs) | Knowledge Graphs are becoming a key technology for large-scale information processing systems containing massive collections of interrelated facts. Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means for development of the newest data methods for data management, data fusion, data merging, and graph optimization and modeling, serving as a source of high quality data and a base for web-scale information integration. | The International Workshop on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs aims to be a meeting point for researchers and practitioners working on the latest advances in the intersection of machine learning technologies and knowledge graphs. 
  2000 – 2006: | Workshop on Theory and Applications of Knowledge Management (TAKMA) | Knowledge Management is a broad field that covers the elicitation/extraction, sharing and application of knowledge within organisations. Each of these areas has received focussed attention in separation to each other; this workshop is intended to bring together academic researchers with developers and users from the industry and public administration to share their expertise on Knowledge Management aspects that is of interest to other areas. | TAKMA Workshop Papers  2006

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

   The International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams  
 Diagrams is a biannual, international and interdisciplinary conference series, covering all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams.  
 Recent technological advances have enabled the large-scale adoption of diagrams in a diverse range of areas. Increasingly sophisticated visual representations are emerging and, to enable effective communication, insight is required into how diagrams are used and when they are appropriate for use. The pervasive, everyday use of diagrams for communicating information and ideas serves to illustrate the importance of providing a sound understanding of the role that diagrams can, and do, play. Research in the field of diagrams aims to improve our understanding of the role of diagrams, sketches and other visualisations in communication, computation, cognition, creative thought, and problem solving. These concerns have triggered a surge of interest in the study of diagrams.  
 The study of diagrammatic communication as a whole must be pursued as an interdisciplinary endeavour. Diagrams attracts a large number of researchers from virtually all related fields, placing the conference as a major international event in the area.  
 Diagrams is the only conference that provides a united forum for all areas that are concerned with the study of diagrams: for example, architecture, artificial intelligence, cartography, cognitive science, computer science, education, graphic design, history of science, human-computer interaction, linguistics, logic, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and software modelling.

  =======================================================================  
  AIM AND SCOPE  
   
  The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of  
  distributed applications, including their design, modelling, implementation  
  and operation, the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering  
  methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and applications.  
  Submissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity,  
  relevance, and technical correctness.  
   
  The topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:  
   
  Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems, particularly in the  
  areas of:  
   
  middleware,  
  cloud, edge and fog computing,  
  big data processing,  
  streaming and complex event processing,  
  distributed social networking,  
  IoT and cyber-physical systems,  
  mobile computing,  
  advanced networking (SDN/NFV),  
  micro-services and service-oriented computing,  
  serverless and FaaS computing,  
  peer-to-peer systems, and  
  data center and internet-scale systems.  
   
  Novel architectures and mechanisms, particularly in the areas of  
   
  publish/subscribe systems,  
  epidemic protocols,  
  language-based approaches,  
  virtualisation and resource allocation,  
  distributed storage,  
  trusted execution environments,  
  blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and  
  distributed consensus mechanisms.  
   
  System issues and design goals, including  
   
  interoperability and adaptation,  
  self-* properties (e.g., self-organisation, self-management,…),  
  security and practical applications of cryptography,  
  trust and privacy,  
  cooperation incentives and fairness,  
  fault-tolerance and dependability,  
  scalability and elasticity, and  
  tail-performance and energy-efficiency.  
   
  =======================================================================  
  SUBMISSIONS  
   
  All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication  
  elsewhere. DAIS 2023 offers three submission tracks:  
   
  * Full research papers in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.  
  * Full practical experience reports, including experimental and evaluation studies,  
  case studies, and practice reports in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.  
  * Work-in-Progress papers, describing ongoing work and interim results, in no more  
  than 6 pages + 2 pages references.  
   
  Papers should be submitted electronically as PDF, using the Springer LNCS style  
  to the conference submission website (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=dais2023).  
  Each paper will undergo a thorough process of peer reviews by the Program Committee.  
  Reviewing is single-blind: author name(s) should appear.  
   
  All papers accepted in any of the conference tracks will be included in the conference  
  proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. Proceedings  
  will be made available at the conference. Submission implies that at least one author will  
  register and attend the conference if the paper is accepted.  
   
  =======================================================================  
  ARTEFACT SUBMISSION  
   
  To improve the reproducibility of results and to increase the visibility of prototypes and  
  tools produced by our community, authors of accepted papers (full papers, experience reports, WiP papers)  
  will be invited to submit publicly available artefacts associated with their paper for evaluation.  
  Based on the result of the evaluation, the paper may be awarded with badges. Artefact submission is optional  
  and the result of the artefact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision. Detailed guidelines  
  for the preparation and submission of the artefacts will be made available to authors.  
   
  =======================================================================

 Games at the Crossroads  
 EasyChair submission link:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=digra2025     
  
  DiGRA 2025 will take place in Valletta, Malta, 30th June – 4th July 2025. A pre-conference will be held one day prior to the official beginning of the conference, on Monday 30th June, with a PhD Consortium and Workshops.  
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.  
 Malta has often been characterised as a country at the crossroads. Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, its archipelago lies at the intersection of ancient and contemporary routes of trade and migration connecting north and south, east and west. Culturally as well as geographically, it bridges Europe and North Africa, and has been marked by millennia of cultural interchange, encounter, and currents of trade and migration across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Malta of the present has also been described as standing at the crossroads of past and future: a country with a rich heritage and tradition that is undergoing rapid change into a cosmopolitan metropolis as a hub in globalised networks of migration and capital. This positions Malta as the ideal location for discussing games at the crossroads: between cultures, between academic disciplines, between media, between different social groups and divergent interests, and between where games (and game studies) have been and where they might go next.  
 As the academic discipline of game studies concludes its first quarter-century since the launch of DiGRA and the Game Studies journal, it is a good time to pause and take stock of how far game studies has come, and where the academic field can go next. Of course, as an interdisciplinary field (Mäyrä 2008; Taylor 2024), game studies has always been positioned at the crossroads, marking a point of encounter between the humanities, the social sciences, creative practice and computer science. However, we are at a point when a lexicon of concepts, ideas and approaches has come to be established within the field. This necessitates a step back to ask questions about what game studies has achieved, as well as about the blind spots of established wisdom and existing knowledge in the field.  
 It is not just game studies as an academic discipline, though, that appears to have arrived at a crossroads. Marked by waves of layoffs, studio shutdowns, questionable labour practices, industry consolidation and simultaneous claims regarding the unsustainability of AAA game production and the unviability of independent game production, there is the feeling that games themselves – as an industry and a technocultural practice - stand at a turning point. Where do games and the games industry go from here?  
 There are other senses in which we can think of games at the crossroads. For historical, cultural and economic reasons, games have tended to be produced within contexts of privilege, and to overwhelmingly represent dominant cultures and values while marginalizing alternative identities. It is still the case that many games offer “white imperial pleasures” (Jayanth 2021). How can we think about games as sites and practices of encounters between different cultures? How can we think post- (and de-)colonially about who gets to make, play, and speak about games (Mukherjee 2017)? How do we ensure that the voices leading such conversations are not the same Western-centric ones that have tended to dominate the field, both as practice and scholarship - furthering DiGRA’s work to widen its international reach and diversity, with regional chapters and attempts to bring the annual conference to different geographical locations? How can we consider the extent to which games and game studies are open to identities and individuals marginalized on the basis of gender, orientation, ethnicity, culture, and nationality, and what happens (or can happen) in the encounter between games and such identities and individuals? (In this regard, it is an enlightening example that Ruberg and Phillips write that “the place where queerness meets games is a site of radical potential” (2018).) Can games serve as places for conversation and discussion, and for the coming together and inclusions of different identities, social groups, cultural and political perspectives – or do they still tend to contribute to entrenched hegemonies?  
 Finally, we might also want to think about the role games do – or might – play at a historical juncture that has been labeled the age of the ‘permacrisis,’ marked by catastrophic climate change, war, genocide, rising inequality, and politics of austerity, division and exclusion (Janik and Vella 2022). How are games intertwined with these permacrises? Do they contribute to the factors fuelling the crises (e.g. Abraham 2022), or can they meaningfully address them? What role do games have – or can have – at a time when ‘we’ (however we define or draw the boundaries of this ‘we’) feel ourselves to stand at a crossroads?  
 We want to encourage scholarly reflection on all the diverse ways games and play stand at the crossroads. Suggested themes include but are not limited to:  
  
 The past, present and future of game studies 
  The games industry at the crossroads 
  Games (and game studies) in a time of crisis 
  Games as points of encounter 
  Post- / decolonial perspectives on games 
  Games, game studies, and identity 
  Games and interdisciplinarity 
  Games, inclusion, exclusion 
  Regional and indigenous perspectives on games and game studies 
  Technology and platforms at the crossroads 
  Materiality, digital, analogue, and hybrid games 
  Games and meaning in a time of crises 
  Players at the crossroads 
  Neoliberalism and games 
  Gamification of work 
  Games and human rights 
   
 The submissions are invited into seven tracks:  
 Philosophy and Theory of Play & Games:  theoretical frameworks and investigations of games and play phenomena as well as meta-reflection on game studies methods and practices.  
 Game Analyses, Criticism, and Interpretation:  analyses, close-readings, and critical discussions of game texts.  
 Game History and Cultural Context:  explorations of game histories, contemporary game cultures and regional game studies.  
 Play and Players:  empirical research on play and playful behaviour, players, fandom, and game communities.  
 Game Design, Production, and Distribution:  reflections on making and research creation, processes of production and design, and the games market.  
 Serious Games and Education:  research on games and play for learning, education, and therapy, and other applications beyond game studies.  
 Analogue Games:  research on any form of analogue games, including but not limited to board games, card games, analogue roleplay games, and other forms not traditionally contemplated in digital game studies.  
 There will be several special events associated with the conference, including a PhD Consortium. It will be organised on the pre-conference day and it will allow PhD students to discuss key issues, benefit from peer support, and seek feedback from experienced scholars. It will provide opportunities for further development of research skills that will be of help to emerging scholars in achieving their academic goals.  
 The organisers also accept thematic workshop proposals (see submission guidelines below).

 Submission Types  
 Full Paper  
 Full papers are expected to be 5000–7000 words plus references, submitted as an anonymized pdf on DiGRA Submission Template. Submissions must be original, which means that they have not been published or are not under peer review elsewhere.  
 Full papers are peer-reviewed publications of original game studies research, presenting mature, complete research. Authors must present accepted full papers at the DiGRA conference. Accepted manuscripts will appear in the Proceedings of the 2025 DiGRA International Conference, which is published in the open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 Extended Abstract  
 The suggested length for an extended abstract is 500–800 words, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (only key references should be included), submitted as an anonymised pdf using the DiGRA Submission Template. Give a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system, but there is no need for extended abstracts to contain an abstract.  
 The purpose of an extended abstract is to demonstrate a contribution interesting to DiGRA audiences. An extended abstract might describe a study or research program that is underway, but might also describe a pending program of research. It might outline findings, or it might establish and discuss a research question. It might describe the study’s method or methodology, or it might focus on outcomes and results. It might describe work that is planned, work that is in progress, or work that has been completed.  
 Accepted extended abstracts will appear in open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 PhD Consortium Submission  
 Selection for the PhD consortium will be based on an extended abstract based on an ongoing PhD research project, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (see Extended Abstract guidelines, above). They should be submitted to PhD Consortium track, as NON-anonymised pdf, with a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system (there is no need for a doctoral consortium application to have an abstract).  
 Submissions must use the DiGRA 2025 submission template.  
 Workshop  
 The conference workshops are three to six hours long sessions focused on a particular game-related topic. Workshops provide an opportunity for new ideas, theories and trends to be presented and discussed. Workshops can also be practical tutorials.  
 Concise workshop proposals of no more than 1000 words (excluding bibliography) should include major objectives and expected outcomes of the workshop, the justification for the workshop informed by current trends and research, the format and activities planned for the workshop, the organisers’ background, the anticipated number of participants and the way they will be selected.  
 Please note that the submission should not be anonymous as the organisers’ background is very important in the decision-making process for workshops.  
 Workshops can be open to participants submissions (the standard model) or by invitation only, replacing the old panel format. The proposal should specify if participants can apply or the list of speakers/participants is set, as in the old panels.  
 Submit workshop proposals directly by email to daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt by 10 February 2025.  
 Number of submissions per author  
 Authors cannot submit more than two papers and/or extended abstracts to DiGRA 2025, including PhD Consortium submissions. An individual can be co-authors on as many full papers and extended abstracts as they like, but cannot submit more than two as main author/presenter. If the limit is exceeded, only the two first submissions will be reviewed.  
 The limit does not include participation in workshops.

 As the academic discipline of game studies concludes its first quarter-century since the launch of DiGRA and the Game Studies journal, it is a good time to pause and take stock of how far game studies has come, and where the academic field can go next. Of course, as an interdisciplinary field (Mäyrä 2008; Taylor 2024), game studies has always been positioned at the crossroads, marking a point of encounter between the humanities, the social sciences, creative practice and computer science. However, we are at a point when a lexicon of concepts, ideas and approaches has come to be established within the field. This necessitates a step back to ask questions about what game studies has achieved, as well as about the blind spots of established wisdom and existing knowledge in the field.  
 It is not just game studies as an academic discipline, though, that appears to have arrived at a crossroads. Marked by waves of layoffs, studio shutdowns, questionable labour practices, industry consolidation and simultaneous claims regarding the unsustainability of AAA game production and the unviability of independent game production, there is the feeling that games themselves – as an industry and a technocultural practice - stand at a turning point. Where do games and the games industry go from here?  
 There are other senses in which we can think of games at the crossroads. For historical, cultural and economic reasons, games have tended to be produced within contexts of privilege, and to overwhelmingly represent dominant cultures and values while marginalizing alternative identities. It is still the case that many games offer “white imperial pleasures” (Jayanth 2021). How can we think about games as sites and practices of encounters between different cultures? How can we think post- (and de-)colonially about who gets to make, play, and speak about games (Mukherjee 2017)? How do we ensure that the voices leading such conversations are not the same Western-centric ones that have tended to dominate the field, both as practice and scholarship - furthering DiGRA’s work to widen its international reach and diversity, with regional chapters and attempts to bring the annual conference to different geographical locations? How can we consider the extent to which games and game studies are open to identities and individuals marginalized on the basis of gender, orientation, ethnicity, culture, and nationality, and what happens (or can happen) in the encounter between games and such identities and individuals? (In this regard, it is an enlightening example that Ruberg and Phillips write that “the place where queerness meets games is a site of radical potential” (2018).) Can games serve as places for conversation and discussion, and for the coming together and inclusions of different identities, social groups, cultural and political perspectives – or do they still tend to contribute to entrenched hegemonies?  
 Finally, we might also want to think about the role games do – or might – play at a historical juncture that has been labeled the age of the ‘permacrisis,’ marked by catastrophic climate change, war, genocide, rising inequality, and politics of austerity, division and exclusion (Janik and Vella 2022). How are games intertwined with these permacrises? Do they contribute to the factors fuelling the crises (e.g. Abraham 2022), or can they meaningfully address them? What role do games have – or can have – at a time when ‘we’ (however we define or draw the boundaries of this ‘we’) feel ourselves to stand at a crossroads?  
 We want to encourage scholarly reflection on all the diverse ways games and play stand at the crossroads. Suggested themes include but are not limited to:  
  
 The past, present and future of game studies 
  The games industry at the crossroads 
  Games (and game studies) in a time of crisis 
  Games as points of encounter 
  Post- / decolonial perspectives on games 
  Games, game studies, and identity 
  Games and interdisciplinarity 
  Games, inclusion, exclusion 
  Regional and indigenous perspectives on games and game studies 
  Technology and platforms at the crossroads 
  Materiality, digital, analogue, and hybrid games 
  Games and meaning in a time of crises 
  Players at the crossroads 
  Neoliberalism and games 
  Gamification of work 
  Games and human rights 
   
 The submissions are invited into seven tracks:  
 Philosophy and Theory of Play & Games:  theoretical frameworks and investigations of games and play phenomena as well as meta-reflection on game studies methods and practices.  
 Game Analyses, Criticism, and Interpretation:  analyses, close-readings, and critical discussions of game texts.  
 Game History and Cultural Context:  explorations of game histories, contemporary game cultures and regional game studies.  
 Play and Players:  empirical research on play and playful behaviour, players, fandom, and game communities.  
 Game Design, Production, and Distribution:  reflections on making and research creation, processes of production and design, and the games market.  
 Serious Games and Education:  research on games and play for learning, education, and therapy, and other applications beyond game studies.  
 Analogue Games:  research on any form of analogue games, including but not limited to board games, card games, analogue roleplay games, and other forms not traditionally contemplated in digital game studies.  
 There will be several special events associated with the conference, including a PhD Consortium. It will be organised on the pre-conference day and it will allow PhD students to discuss key issues, benefit from peer support, and seek feedback from experienced scholars. It will provide opportunities for further development of research skills that will be of help to emerging scholars in achieving their academic goals.  
 The organisers also accept thematic workshop proposals (see submission guidelines below).

 Authors are asked to direct questions to the program chairs: Krista Bonello Rutter Giappone (kbone02@um.edu.mt), Jing Sun (Jing.Sun@xjtlu.edu.cn), and Víctor Navarro-Remesal (vnavarro@tecnocampus.cat).  
   
 Submission Types  
 Full Paper  
 Full papers are expected to be 5000–7000 words plus references, submitted as an anonymized pdf on DiGRA Submission Template. Submissions must be original, which means that they have not been published or are not under peer review elsewhere.  
 Full papers are peer-reviewed publications of original game studies research, presenting mature, complete research. Authors must present accepted full papers at the DiGRA conference. Accepted manuscripts will appear in the Proceedings of the 2025 DiGRA International Conference, which is published in the open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 Extended Abstract  
 The suggested length for an extended abstract is 500–800 words, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (only key references should be included), submitted as an anonymised pdf using the DiGRA Submission Template. Give a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system, but there is no need for extended abstracts to contain an abstract.  
 The purpose of an extended abstract is to demonstrate a contribution interesting to DiGRA audiences. An extended abstract might describe a study or research program that is underway, but might also describe a pending program of research. It might outline findings, or it might establish and discuss a research question. It might describe the study’s method or methodology, or it might focus on outcomes and results. It might describe work that is planned, work that is in progress, or work that has been completed.  
 Accepted extended abstracts will appear in open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 PhD Consortium Submission  
 Selection for the PhD consortium will be based on an extended abstract based on an ongoing PhD research project, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (see Extended Abstract guidelines, above). They should be submitted to PhD Consortium track, as NON-anonymised pdf, with a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system (there is no need for a doctoral consortium application to have an abstract).  
 Submissions must use the DiGRA 2025 submission template.  
 Workshop  
 The conference workshops are three to six hours long sessions focused on a particular game-related topic. Workshops provide an opportunity for new ideas, theories and trends to be presented and discussed. Workshops can also be practical tutorials.  
 Concise workshop proposals of no more than 1000 words (excluding bibliography) should include major objectives and expected outcomes of the workshop, the justification for the workshop informed by current trends and research, the format and activities planned for the workshop, the organisers’ background, the anticipated number of participants and the way they will be selected.  
 Please note that the submission should not be anonymous as the organisers’ background is very important in the decision-making process for workshops.  
 Workshops can be open to participants submissions (the standard model) or by invitation only, replacing the old panel format. The proposal should specify if participants can apply or the list of speakers/participants is set, as in the old panels.  
 Submit workshop proposals directly by email to daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt by 10 February 2025.  
 Number of submissions per author  
 Authors cannot submit more than two papers and/or extended abstracts to DiGRA 2025, including PhD Consortium submissions.

 Games at the Crossroads  
 EasyChair submission link:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=digra2025     
  
  DiGRA 2025 will take place in Valletta, Malta, 30th June – 4th July 2025. A pre-conference will be held one day prior to the official beginning of the conference, on Monday 30th June, with a PhD Consortium and Workshops.  
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.  
 Malta has often been characterised as a country at the crossroads. Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, its archipelago lies at the intersection of ancient and contemporary routes of trade and migration connecting north and south, east and west. Culturally as well as geographically, it bridges Europe and North Africa, and has been marked by millennia of cultural interchange, encounter, and currents of trade and migration across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Malta of the present has also been described as standing at the crossroads of past and future: a country with a rich heritage and tradition that is undergoing rapid change into a cosmopolitan metropolis as a hub in globalised networks of migration and capital. This positions Malta as the ideal location for discussing games at the crossroads: between cultures, between academic disciplines, between media, between different social groups and divergent interests, and between where games (and game studies) have been and where they might go next.  
 As the academic discipline of game studies concludes its first quarter-century since the launch of DiGRA and the Game Studies journal, it is a good time to pause and take stock of how far game studies has come, and where the academic field can go next. Of course, as an interdisciplinary field (Mäyrä 2008; Taylor 2024), game studies has always been positioned at the crossroads, marking a point of encounter between the humanities, the social sciences, creative practice and computer science. However, we are at a point when a lexicon of concepts, ideas and approaches has come to be established within the field. This necessitates a step back to ask questions about what game studies has achieved, as well as about the blind spots of established wisdom and existing knowledge in the field.  
 It is not just game studies as an academic discipline, though, that appears to have arrived at a crossroads. Marked by waves of layoffs, studio shutdowns, questionable labour practices, industry consolidation and simultaneous claims regarding the unsustainability of AAA game production and the unviability of independent game production, there is the feeling that games themselves – as an industry and a technocultural practice - stand at a turning point.

 f  t    

 Conference Venue  
 We are excited to host DiGRA 2025 at one of Malta’s most unique venues, the University of Malta’s Valletta Campus. This campus is housed in the historic Old University Building, dating back to the late 16th century, originally established by the Jesuits as a centre for education and religious instruction. Located in the heart of Valletta, Malta’s capital city - and a Baroque walled city recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site - the campus offers a truly special setting. The walls of this university have a lot of stories to tell!  

 The City of Valletta  
 The location of the venue makes it convenient for our visitors to explore Malta to its fullest. You will find yourself surrounded by bars, churches, museums, cafes, restaurants, and historic forts and palaces. Additionally, the campus offers easy access to government offices, cultural institutions, and amenities, enhancing the overall experience for students and visitors alike.  
 Despite its historical setting, the Old University Building has recently undergone a complete renovation, and is equipped with modern facilities, including lecture halls, conference rooms, and study spaces, supporting a wide range of academic and cultural activities.  
 Valletta is well-connected to the rest of the country with numerous bus and ferry terminals, making it easy for you to explore Malta on a whim.

 Games at the Crossroads  
 EasyChair submission link:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=digra2025     
  
  DiGRA 2025 will take place in Valletta, Malta, 30th June – 4th July 2025. A pre-conference will be held one day prior to the official beginning of the conference, on Monday 30th June, with a PhD Consortium and Workshops.  
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.  
 Malta has often been characterised as a country at the crossroads. Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, its archipelago lies at the intersection of ancient and contemporary routes of trade and migration connecting north and south, east and west. Culturally as well as geographically, it bridges Europe and North Africa, and has been marked by millennia of cultural interchange, encounter, and currents of trade and migration across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Malta of the present has also been described as standing at the crossroads of past and future: a country with a rich heritage and tradition that is undergoing rapid change into a cosmopolitan metropolis as a hub in globalised networks of migration and capital. This positions Malta as the ideal location for discussing games at the crossroads: between cultures, between academic disciplines, between media, between different social groups and divergent interests, and between where games (and game studies) have been and where they might go next.  
 As the academic discipline of game studies concludes its first quarter-century since the launch of DiGRA and the Game Studies journal, it is a good time to pause and take stock of how far game studies has come, and where the academic field can go next. Of course, as an interdisciplinary field (Mäyrä 2008; Taylor 2024), game studies has always been positioned at the crossroads, marking a point of encounter between the humanities, the social sciences, creative practice and computer science. However, we are at a point when a lexicon of concepts, ideas and approaches has come to be established within the field. This necessitates a step back to ask questions about what game studies has achieved, as well as about the blind spots of established wisdom and existing knowledge in the field.  
 It is not just game studies as an academic discipline, though, that appears to have arrived at a crossroads. Marked by waves of layoffs, studio shutdowns, questionable labour practices, industry consolidation and simultaneous claims regarding the unsustainability of AAA game production and the unviability of independent game production, there is the feeling that games themselves – as an industry and a technocultural practice - stand at a turning point. Where do games and the games industry go from here?  
 There are other senses in which we can think of games at the crossroads. For historical, cultural and economic reasons, games have tended to be produced within contexts of privilege, and to overwhelmingly represent dominant cultures and values while marginalizing alternative identities. It is still the case that many games offer “white imperial pleasures” (Jayanth 2021). How can we think about games as sites and practices of encounters between different cultures? How can we think post- (and de-)colonially about who gets to make, play, and speak about games (Mukherjee 2017)? How do we ensure that the voices leading such conversations are not the same Western-centric ones that have tended to dominate the field, both as practice and scholarship - furthering DiGRA’s work to widen its international reach and diversity, with regional chapters and attempts to bring the annual conference to different geographical locations? How can we consider the extent to which games and game studies are open to identities and individuals marginalized on the basis of gender, orientation, ethnicity, culture, and nationality, and what happens (or can happen) in the encounter between games and such identities and individuals? (In this regard, it is an enlightening example that Ruberg and Phillips write that “the place where queerness meets games is a site of radical potential” (2018).) Can games serve as places for conversation and discussion, and for the coming together and inclusions of different identities, social groups, cultural and political perspectives – or do they still tend to contribute to entrenched hegemonies?  
 Finally, we might also want to think about the role games do – or might – play at a historical juncture that has been labeled the age of the ‘permacrisis,’ marked by catastrophic climate change, war, genocide, rising inequality, and politics of austerity, division and exclusion (Janik and Vella 2022). How are games intertwined with these permacrises? Do they contribute to the factors fuelling the crises (e.g. Abraham 2022), or can they meaningfully address them? What role do games have – or can have – at a time when ‘we’ (however we define or draw the boundaries of this ‘we’) feel ourselves to stand at a crossroads?  
 We want to encourage scholarly reflection on all the diverse ways games and play stand at the crossroads. Suggested themes include but are not limited to:  
  
 The past, present and future of game studies 
  The games industry at the crossroads 
  Games (and game studies) in a time of crisis 
  Games as points of encounter 
  Post- / decolonial perspectives on games 
  Games, game studies, and identity 
  Games and interdisciplinarity 
  Games, inclusion, exclusion 
  Regional and indigenous perspectives on games and game studies 
  Technology and platforms at the crossroads 
  Materiality, digital, analogue, and hybrid games 
  Games and meaning in a time of crises 
  Players at the crossroads 
  Neoliberalism and games 
  Gamification of work 
  Games and human rights 
   
 The submissions are invited into seven tracks:  
 Philosophy and Theory of Play & Games:  theoretical frameworks and investigations of games and play phenomena as well as meta-reflection on game studies methods and practices.  
 Game Analyses, Criticism, and Interpretation:  analyses, close-readings, and critical discussions of game texts.  
 Game History and Cultural Context:  explorations of game histories, contemporary game cultures and regional game studies.  
 Play and Players:  empirical research on play and playful behaviour, players, fandom, and game communities.  
 Game Design, Production, and Distribution:  reflections on making and research creation, processes of production and design, and the games market.  
 Serious Games and Education:  research on games and play for learning, education, and therapy, and other applications beyond game studies.  
 Analogue Games:  research on any form of analogue games, including but not limited to board games, card games, analogue roleplay games, and other forms not traditionally contemplated in digital game studies.  
 There will be several special events associated with the conference, including a PhD Consortium. It will be organised on the pre-conference day and it will allow PhD students to discuss key issues, benefit from peer support, and seek feedback from experienced scholars. It will provide opportunities for further development of research skills that will be of help to emerging scholars in achieving their academic goals.  
 The organisers also accept thematic workshop proposals (see submission guidelines below).  
   
 About DiGRA  
 The Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) was established by an international group of scholars in Tampere, Finland, after the Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference that took place in 2002. Since then, it has continued to grow, including the establishment of many regional chapters in different parts of the world.

 Submission Guidelines  
 We welcome a range of contributions to DiGRA 2025: full papers, extended abstracts, and doctoral consortium participation, and workshop proposals.  
 Full papers and extended abstracts will be peer-reviewed, published on the conference website and published in the conference proceedings available via open-access through the DiGRA Digital Library: http://www.digra.org/digital-library. Workshop proposals will be selected by the conference organisers based on non-anonymous submissions.  
 All except workshop submissions should be made via EasyChair. Workshop proposals should be sent directly to the conference email: daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt.  
 Authors are asked to direct questions to the program chairs: Krista Bonello Rutter Giappone (kbone02@um.edu.mt), Jing Sun (Jing.Sun@xjtlu.edu.cn), and Víctor Navarro-Remesal (vnavarro@tecnocampus.cat).  
   
 Submission Types  
 Full Paper  
 Full papers are expected to be 5000–7000 words plus references, submitted as an anonymized pdf on DiGRA Submission Template. Submissions must be original, which means that they have not been published or are not under peer review elsewhere.  
 Full papers are peer-reviewed publications of original game studies research, presenting mature, complete research. Authors must present accepted full papers at the DiGRA conference. Accepted manuscripts will appear in the Proceedings of the 2025 DiGRA International Conference, which is published in the open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 Extended Abstract  
 The suggested length for an extended abstract is 500–800 words, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (only key references should be included), submitted as an anonymised pdf using the DiGRA Submission Template. Give a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system, but there is no need for extended abstracts to contain an abstract.  
 The purpose of an extended abstract is to demonstrate a contribution interesting to DiGRA audiences. An extended abstract might describe a study or research program that is underway, but might also describe a pending program of research. It might outline findings, or it might establish and discuss a research question. It might describe the study’s method or methodology, or it might focus on outcomes and results. It might describe work that is planned, work that is in progress, or work that has been completed.  
 Accepted extended abstracts will appear in open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 PhD Consortium Submission  
 Selection for the PhD consortium will be based on an extended abstract based on an ongoing PhD research project, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (see Extended Abstract guidelines, above). They should be submitted to PhD Consortium track, as NON-anonymised pdf, with a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system (there is no need for a doctoral consortium application to have an abstract).  
 Submissions must use the DiGRA 2025 submission template.  
 Workshop  
 The conference workshops are three to six hours long sessions focused on a particular game-related topic. Workshops provide an opportunity for new ideas, theories and trends to be presented and discussed. Workshops can also be practical tutorials.  
 Concise workshop proposals of no more than 1000 words (excluding bibliography) should include major objectives and expected outcomes of the workshop, the justification for the workshop informed by current trends and research, the format and activities planned for the workshop, the organisers’ background, the anticipated number of participants and the way they will be selected.  
 Please note that the submission should not be anonymous as the organisers’ background is very important in the decision-making process for workshops.  
 Workshops can be open to participants submissions (the standard model) or by invitation only, replacing the old panel format. The proposal should specify if participants can apply or the list of speakers/participants is set, as in the old panels.  
 Submit workshop proposals directly by email to daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt by 10 February 2025.  
 Number of submissions per author  
 Authors cannot submit more than two papers and/or extended abstracts to DiGRA 2025, including PhD Consortium submissions. An individual can be co-authors on as many full papers and extended abstracts as they like, but cannot submit more than two as main author/presenter. If the limit is exceeded, only the two first submissions will be reviewed.  
 The limit does not include participation in workshops.

  General Information  
 The annual DIMVA conference serves as a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in the broader areas of intrusion detection, malware analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Each year, DIMVA brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss novel research in these areas. DIMVA is organized by the special interest group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI). The conference proceedings will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 Topics of Interest  
 DIMVA solicits submissions of high-quality, original scientific papers presenting novel research on malware analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and related systems security topics.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
   
 Intrusions  
 Novel approaches and domains 
  Insider detection 
  Prevention and response 
  Data leakage, exfiltration, and poisoning 
  Result correlation and cooperation 
  Evasion and other attacks 
  Potentials and limitation 
  Operational experiences 
  Privacy, legal, and social aspects 
  Targeted attacks 
  Analysis or detection of cryptocurrency heists 
  Malware  
 Automated analyses 
  Behavioral models 
  Prevention and containment 
  Classification 
  Lineage 
  Forensics and recovery 
  Underground economy 
  Vulnerabilities in malware 
  Financially targeted malware (e.g., ransomware, DeFi) 
  Vulnerability detection  
 Vulnerability prevention 
  Vulnerability analysis 
  Exploitation and defenses 
  Hardware vulnerabilities 
  Situational awareness 
  Active probing 
  Vulnerabilities in decentralized systems 
   
 Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough details to enable reproducibility of the experimental results. We encourage papers that bridge research in different communities. We also welcome experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learnt.  
 Types of Submissions Solicited  
 We invite full papers  for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to 20 pages in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices.  
 Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.  
 While we do not accept short papers  , we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. Accepted posters will be invited to submit a poster paper to accompany the poster. Poster papers should be at least 4 pages, but no more than 6 pages long in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices. Poster papers will be included in the proceedings. The title of Poster papers must start with the words "Poster".  
 Submission Guidelines  
 DIMVA 2025 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.  
 Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.  
 Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g., https://anonymous.4open.science/  .  
 Ethical considerations  
 Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.  
 Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.  
 If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs at pc-chairs@dimva.org  .  

  Call for Posters  
 Important Dates (AoE)  
 Submission: up to Jun 14, 2025 
  Notification: from Jun 19, 2025 
  High quality posters enable discussion of recent research results, deep interactions with interested attendees, a peek into ongoing work, and presentation of new crazy ideas. DIMVA welcomes the submission of posters on preliminary findings, ongoing work, or recently published work. Posters will be presented in a forum where attendees can mingle and interact. Poster submissions contain an extended abstract of up to two pages in the DIMVA paper submission format along with a draft of the poster. If the poster refers to a published paper, it must be referenced. The poster submission is now closed. At the conference, we will provide posters stands. Attendees can bring their printed posters up to size A0.

  General Information  
 The annual DIMVA conference serves as a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in the broader areas of intrusion detection, malware analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Each year, DIMVA brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss novel research in these areas. DIMVA is organized by the special interest group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI). The conference proceedings will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 Topics of Interest  
 DIMVA solicits submissions of high-quality, original scientific papers presenting novel research on malware analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and related systems security topics.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
   
 Intrusions  
 Novel approaches and domains 
  Insider detection 
  Prevention and response 
  Data leakage, exfiltration, and poisoning 
  Result correlation and cooperation 
  Evasion and other attacks 
  Potentials and limitation 
  Operational experiences 
  Privacy, legal, and social aspects 
  Targeted attacks 
  Analysis or detection of cryptocurrency heists 
  Malware  
 Automated analyses 
  Behavioral models 
  Prevention and containment 
  Classification 
  Lineage 
  Forensics and recovery 
  Underground economy 
  Vulnerabilities in malware 
  Financially targeted malware (e.g., ransomware, DeFi) 
  Vulnerability detection  
 Vulnerability prevention 
  Vulnerability analysis 
  Exploitation and defenses 
  Hardware vulnerabilities 
  Situational awareness 
  Active probing 
  Vulnerabilities in decentralized systems 
   
 Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough details to enable reproducibility of the experimental results. We encourage papers that bridge research in different communities. We also welcome experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learnt.  
 Types of Submissions Solicited  
 We invite full papers  for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to 20 pages in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices.  
 Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.  
 While we do not accept short papers  , we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. Accepted posters will be invited to submit a poster paper to accompany the poster. Poster papers should be at least 4 pages, but no more than 6 pages long in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices. Poster papers will be included in the proceedings. The title of Poster papers must start with the words "Poster".  
 Submission Guidelines  
 DIMVA 2025 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.  
 Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.  
 Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g., https://anonymous.4open.science/  .  
 Ethical considerations  
 Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.  
 Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.  
 If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs at pc-chairs@dimva.org  .  

  Call for Posters  
 Important Dates (AoE)  
 Submission: up to Jun 14, 2025 
  Notification: from Jun 19, 2025 
  High quality posters enable discussion of recent research results, deep interactions with interested attendees, a peek into ongoing work, and presentation of new crazy ideas. DIMVA welcomes the submission of posters on preliminary findings, ongoing work, or recently published work. Posters will be presented in a forum where attendees can mingle and interact. Poster submissions contain an extended abstract of up to two pages in the DIMVA paper submission format along with a draft of the poster. If the poster refers to a published paper, it must be referenced. The poster submission is now closed. At the conference, we will provide posters stands. Attendees can bring their printed posters up to size A0.

 Games at the Crossroads  
 EasyChair submission link:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=digra2025     
  
  DiGRA 2025 will take place in Valletta, Malta, 30th June – 4th July 2025. A pre-conference will be held one day prior to the official beginning of the conference, on Monday 30th June, with a PhD Consortium and Workshops.  
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.  
 Malta has often been characterised as a country at the crossroads. Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, its archipelago lies at the intersection of ancient and contemporary routes of trade and migration connecting north and south, east and west. Culturally as well as geographically, it bridges Europe and North Africa, and has been marked by millennia of cultural interchange, encounter, and currents of trade and migration across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Malta of the present has also been described as standing at the crossroads of past and future: a country with a rich heritage and tradition that is undergoing rapid change into a cosmopolitan metropolis as a hub in globalised networks of migration and capital. This positions Malta as the ideal location for discussing games at the crossroads: between cultures, between academic disciplines, between media, between different social groups and divergent interests, and between where games (and game studies) have been and where they might go next.  
 As the academic discipline of game studies concludes its first quarter-century since the launch of DiGRA and the Game Studies journal, it is a good time to pause and take stock of how far game studies has come, and where the academic field can go next. Of course, as an interdisciplinary field (Mäyrä 2008; Taylor 2024), game studies has always been positioned at the crossroads, marking a point of encounter between the humanities, the social sciences, creative practice and computer science. However, we are at a point when a lexicon of concepts, ideas and approaches has come to be established within the field. This necessitates a step back to ask questions about what game studies has achieved, as well as about the blind spots of established wisdom and existing knowledge in the field.  
 It is not just game studies as an academic discipline, though, that appears to have arrived at a crossroads. Marked by waves of layoffs, studio shutdowns, questionable labour practices, industry consolidation and simultaneous claims regarding the unsustainability of AAA game production and the unviability of independent game production, there is the feeling that games themselves – as an industry and a technocultural practice - stand at a turning point. Where do games and the games industry go from here?  
 There are other senses in which we can think of games at the crossroads. For historical, cultural and economic reasons, games have tended to be produced within contexts of privilege, and to overwhelmingly represent dominant cultures and values while marginalizing alternative identities. It is still the case that many games offer “white imperial pleasures” (Jayanth 2021). How can we think about games as sites and practices of encounters between different cultures? How can we think post- (and de-)colonially about who gets to make, play, and speak about games (Mukherjee 2017)? How do we ensure that the voices leading such conversations are not the same Western-centric ones that have tended to dominate the field, both as practice and scholarship - furthering DiGRA’s work to widen its international reach and diversity, with regional chapters and attempts to bring the annual conference to different geographical locations? How can we consider the extent to which games and game studies are open to identities and individuals marginalized on the basis of gender, orientation, ethnicity, culture, and nationality, and what happens (or can happen) in the encounter between games and such identities and individuals? (In this regard, it is an enlightening example that Ruberg and Phillips write that “the place where queerness meets games is a site of radical potential” (2018).) Can games serve as places for conversation and discussion, and for the coming together and inclusions of different identities, social groups, cultural and political perspectives – or do they still tend to contribute to entrenched hegemonies?  
 Finally, we might also want to think about the role games do – or might – play at a historical juncture that has been labeled the age of the ‘permacrisis,’ marked by catastrophic climate change, war, genocide, rising inequality, and politics of austerity, division and exclusion (Janik and Vella 2022). How are games intertwined with these permacrises? Do they contribute to the factors fuelling the crises (e.g. Abraham 2022), or can they meaningfully address them? What role do games have – or can have – at a time when ‘we’ (however we define or draw the boundaries of this ‘we’) feel ourselves to stand at a crossroads?  
 We want to encourage scholarly reflection on all the diverse ways games and play stand at the crossroads. Suggested themes include but are not limited to:  
  
 The past, present and future of game studies 
  The games industry at the crossroads 
  Games (and game studies) in a time of crisis 
  Games as points of encounter 
  Post- / decolonial perspectives on games 
  Games, game studies, and identity 
  Games and interdisciplinarity 
  Games, inclusion, exclusion 
  Regional and indigenous perspectives on games and game studies 
  Technology and platforms at the crossroads 
  Materiality, digital, analogue, and hybrid games 
  Games and meaning in a time of crises 
  Players at the crossroads 
  Neoliberalism and games 
  Gamification of work 
  Games and human rights 
   
 The submissions are invited into seven tracks:  
 Philosophy and Theory of Play & Games:  theoretical frameworks and investigations of games and play phenomena as well as meta-reflection on game studies methods and practices.  
 Game Analyses, Criticism, and Interpretation:  analyses, close-readings, and critical discussions of game texts.  
 Game History and Cultural Context:  explorations of game histories, contemporary game cultures and regional game studies.  
 Play and Players:  empirical research on play and playful behaviour, players, fandom, and game communities.  
 Game Design, Production, and Distribution:  reflections on making and research creation, processes of production and design, and the games market.  
 Serious Games and Education:  research on games and play for learning, education, and therapy, and other applications beyond game studies.  
 Analogue Games:  research on any form of analogue games, including but not limited to board games, card games, analogue roleplay games, and other forms not traditionally contemplated in digital game studies.  
 There will be several special events associated with the conference, including a PhD Consortium. It will be organised on the pre-conference day and it will allow PhD students to discuss key issues, benefit from peer support, and seek feedback from experienced scholars. It will provide opportunities for further development of research skills that will be of help to emerging scholars in achieving their academic goals.  
 The organisers also accept thematic workshop proposals (see submission guidelines below).  
   
 About DiGRA  
 The Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) was established by an international group of scholars in Tampere, Finland, after the Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference that took place in 2002. Since then, it has continued to grow, including the establishment of many regional chapters in different parts of the world.

 Submission Guidelines  
 We welcome a range of contributions to DiGRA 2025: full papers, extended abstracts, and doctoral consortium participation, and workshop proposals.  
 Full papers and extended abstracts will be peer-reviewed, published on the conference website and published in the conference proceedings available via open-access through the DiGRA Digital Library: http://www.digra.org/digital-library. Workshop proposals will be selected by the conference organisers based on non-anonymous submissions.  
 All except workshop submissions should be made via EasyChair. Workshop proposals should be sent directly to the conference email: daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt.  
 Authors are asked to direct questions to the program chairs: Krista Bonello Rutter Giappone (kbone02@um.edu.mt), Jing Sun (Jing.Sun@xjtlu.edu.cn), and Víctor Navarro-Remesal (vnavarro@tecnocampus.cat).  
   
 Submission Types  
 Full Paper  
 Full papers are expected to be 5000–7000 words plus references, submitted as an anonymized pdf on DiGRA Submission Template. Submissions must be original, which means that they have not been published or are not under peer review elsewhere.  
 Full papers are peer-reviewed publications of original game studies research, presenting mature, complete research. Authors must present accepted full papers at the DiGRA conference. Accepted manuscripts will appear in the Proceedings of the 2025 DiGRA International Conference, which is published in the open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 Extended Abstract  
 The suggested length for an extended abstract is 500–800 words, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (only key references should be included), submitted as an anonymised pdf using the DiGRA Submission Template. Give a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system, but there is no need for extended abstracts to contain an abstract.  
 The purpose of an extended abstract is to demonstrate a contribution interesting to DiGRA audiences. An extended abstract might describe a study or research program that is underway, but might also describe a pending program of research. It might outline findings, or it might establish and discuss a research question. It might describe the study’s method or methodology, or it might focus on outcomes and results. It might describe work that is planned, work that is in progress, or work that has been completed.  
 Accepted extended abstracts will appear in open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 PhD Consortium Submission  
 Selection for the PhD consortium will be based on an extended abstract based on an ongoing PhD research project, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (see Extended Abstract guidelines, above). They should be submitted to PhD Consortium track, as NON-anonymised pdf, with a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system (there is no need for a doctoral consortium application to have an abstract).  
 Submissions must use the DiGRA 2025 submission template.  
 Workshop  
 The conference workshops are three to six hours long sessions focused on a particular game-related topic. Workshops provide an opportunity for new ideas, theories and trends to be presented and discussed. Workshops can also be practical tutorials.  
 Concise workshop proposals of no more than 1000 words (excluding bibliography) should include major objectives and expected outcomes of the workshop, the justification for the workshop informed by current trends and research, the format and activities planned for the workshop, the organisers’ background, the anticipated number of participants and the way they will be selected.  
 Please note that the submission should not be anonymous as the organisers’ background is very important in the decision-making process for workshops.  
 Workshops can be open to participants submissions (the standard model) or by invitation only, replacing the old panel format. The proposal should specify if participants can apply or the list of speakers/participants is set, as in the old panels.  
 Submit workshop proposals directly by email to daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt by 10 February 2025.  
 Number of submissions per author  
 Authors cannot submit more than two papers and/or extended abstracts to DiGRA 2025, including PhD Consortium submissions. An individual can be co-authors on as many full papers and extended abstracts as they like, but cannot submit more than two as main author/presenter. If the limit is exceeded, only the two first submissions will be reviewed.  
 The limit does not include participation in workshops.

 Publisher Description   

 This book presents papers on various problems of dependability in computer systems and networks that were discussed at the 14th DepCoS-RELCOMEX conference, in BrunÃ³w, Poland, from 1st to 5th July 2019. Discussing new ideas, research results and developments in the design, implementation, maintenance and analysis of complex computer systems, it is of interest to researchers and practitioners who are dealing with dependability issues in such systems.Dependability analysis came as a response to new challenges in the evaluation of contemporary complex systems, which should be considered as systems of people â€“ with their needs and behaviours â€“interacting with technical communication channels (such as mobile activities, iCloud, Internet of Everything) and online applications, often operating in hostile environments. The diversity of topics covered, illustrates the variety of methods used in this area, often with the help of the latest results in artificial and computational intelligence.

 Publisher Description   

 Conducting research can be one of the most fascinating--and intimidating--tasks for students and scholars. A relevant and accessible guide to quantitative research, Quantitative Research Methods for Communication: A Hands-On Approach offers an innovative and insightful look at this complex  
 subject. Drawing on their extensive research and teaching experience in the field of communication, authors Jason S. Wrench, Candice Thomas-Maddox, Virginia Peck Richmond, and James C. McCroskey have compiled their diverse, acclaimed work into one comprehensive volume.  
 In clear, straightforward language, the authors encourage students to take an active, hands-on role in the learning process, giving them the tools they need to locate, conduct, collect, and present their research. Students are not only introduced to new skills, but they also have the opportunity to  
 immediately apply these skills in research scenarios. Beginning with a brief history of social science research, the text incorporates the following resources:  
 * An introduction to the fundamentals of communication research, from library skills to basic mathematical concepts  
 * An examination of the three most common techniques used in communication  
 research: survey, content analysis, and experiment  
 * A sophisticated analysis of sampling and hypothesis testing  
 * A step-by-step introduction to statistical tools  
 * Guided research assignments based on actual data-driven research questions  
 * In-depth analyses of articles that feature statistical tests  
 * A guide to presenting research findings, from delivering research papers at conferences to submitting original research for publication  
 The text integrates rich pedagogical features throughout, including chapter objectives, case studies, data sheets, and lists of key terms. The accompanying CD-ROM offers many helpful tools, including ten articles originally published by the Eastern Communication Association and a Student Workbook.  
 An invaluable resource for gathering and processing information in the twenty-first century, Quantitative Research Methods for Communication equips students with the skills--and confidence--to produce their own cutting-edge research.
