 Call for Papers  
 Overview  
 The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13 2025.   
 We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation. The research may target systems in a broad range of domains, including networking, high-performance computing, machine learning, IoT, cloud, edge, multimedia, mobile, and cyber-physical systems. The work may target diverse system metrics such as latency, throughput, reliability, cost, accuracy, fairness, energy, and carbon footprint.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Awards and the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).

The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft Tracking | : SIGMETRICS uses "soft" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high-performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks,cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site. 
  The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of the claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to "opt out" of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to "opt out", an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS, and submit the paper with an authors' response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Call for Full Papers  
   
 In Brief  
 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 48th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as an in-person conference from July 13th to 18th, 2025 in Padua, Italy. For the full paper call, we welcome high-impact original papers with contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. Please note CFPs for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2025 venues will be released separately.  
 Important Dates for Full Papers  
 Deadlines time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  
 Full paper abstracts due: January 16, 2025 
  Full papers due: January 23, 2025 
  Full paper notifications: March 28, 2025 
   
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 16, 2025 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 23, 2025 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from other conferences should submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts ("placeholder abstracts").  
 Submission Guidelines  
 See this brief checklist  to strengthen an IR paper, for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2025).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length  (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references), with unrestricted space for references  , in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf  templates are available from the ACM Website  (use sigconf  proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.  
 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}   
 Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025   
 by selecting the “SIGIR 2025 Full Papers”  track.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for SIGIR 2025, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person  .  
 Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit, to SIGIR 2025, papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to the SIGIR 2025 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  . Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 In-Person Attendance Policy  
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.  
 All accepted papers (including all tracks) to the main conference and workshops are expected to be presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper will attend the conference in person to deliver the paper and address audience questions during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted. More information at the SIGIR 2025 In-presence Policy  page.  
 Child Care Service  
 SIGIR 2025 promotes inclusion and attendance also by organizing a child care service, in order to foster work-family balance by offering congress attendees the opportunity to attend events with their children.  
 Children from 0 to 12 years of age are welcomed in a specially set up room inside Padua Congress Center throughout the duration of the congress. A colorful, “warm”, safe and welcoming environment, in the same structure that hosts the congresses, a protected place where parents can leave their children, but at the same time stay in touch with them during the breaks of the different sessions.  
 The nursery space dedicated to the 0-3 age group, equipped with a changing table and other facilities dedicated to the little ones, is next to the kids’ area for children over 3 years old and a cinema room for screenings.  
 The activities are run by a company specialized in education services with expert staff, appointed by Padua Congress Center, and include thematic workshops - from painting to creative activities - as well as playtime also in the open air, in the facility's outdoor spaces. Children are also offered lunch.  
 The service is available - for a fee (depending on sponsors) - to all SIGIR 2025 attendees who request it. For more information and updates, check out the SIGIR 2025 Child Care  page.  
 Authorship Policy  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy  before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship, under any circumstances, will be permitted after the abstract submission deadline or for the camera-ready submission. So please, make sure you have listed authors correctly at abstract submission time.  
 Use of AI  
 All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence  .  
 Desk Rejection Policy  
 Submissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy  , length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty  , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:

  Paper Format  
 Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  . SIGSPATIAL uses the Conference Proceedings Primary Article template with two-column format. Alterations to the template, especially to gain more space, will be grounds for administrative rejection without further technical review. Submissions to ACM SIGSPATIAL are single-blind -- i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors should be listed in the submitted version. The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes to the author list are allowed for accepted papers.   
 All papers should be submitted through EasyChair using the following link:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigspatial2024   
 Research, Systems and Industrial Experience Papers  
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. In addition to regular research papers, authors are invited to submit systems papers, which focus on novel system architectures and software applications, and industrial experience papers, which describe original industrial experiences, challenges, and practical applications. For these papers, authors should append “(Systems Paper) ” or “(Industrial Paper)” to the title, respectively. Submissions are limited to 10 pages (excluding references), with up to 2 additional pages after the references to be used for appendices. References do not count towards the page limit. Submissions that do not follow the page limit requirements will be administratively rejected without any technical reviews. Based on the evaluations from the reviewers, the Program Committee may recommend that certain papers are accepted as 4-page (including references) poster papers for poster presentation. Both full and poster papers will appear in the conference proceedings. All those page numbers are based on the ACM two-column conference proceedings template.  
 Vision Papers  
 Authors are invited to submit papers describing a visionary proposition foreseeing future directions and compelling research opportunities for the SIGSPATIAL community. Vision papers will be evaluated and selected on their potential of expanding current SIGSPATIAL research agenda by defining new research topics and problems with transformative-impact potential. Authors should not be bound by existing technologies or datasets, but rather look further ahead exploring out-of-box (blue sky) thinking, paradigm change, and quantum leap in knowledge. For instance, papers from 10-20 years ago foreseeing and proposing eco-routing and ride-sharing (and all the technical challenges they would bring) would have been “visionary”, as would papers today presenting opportunities for possibly transdisciplinary work expanding SIGSPATIAL’s research horizon on impactful issues such as quantum computing, climate change, spatial aspects of responsible computing research, and spatial data science for societal good. Papers proposing slightly better solutions to well-studied problems (or variations thereof) with known solutions are not relevant and should not be submitted to this track. Submissions to the Vision Paper track should follow the same formatting as regular papers but are limited to 4 pages (including references) and “(Vision Paper)” should be appended to its title. Accepted vision papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and pending confirmation, the best submission(s), will be eligible for partial travel grants.  
 Demonstration Papers  
 Authors are invited to submit demo papers describing original systems for demonstration presentation at the conference. Submissions are limited to 4 pages (including references) and “(Demo Paper)” should be appended to the title. Accepted demo papers will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 Data and Resources Track  
 The vast majority of research work done by SIGSPATIAL's community requires experimentation using suitable datasets. Even though some data portals have been created, most datasets are often found after ad-hoc searches, and may not be well documented. Researchers often also resort to creating and using their own synthetic datasets which are often not published, neither the datasets themselves nor how they were and/or could be (re)generated. This year, we are having the "Dataset and Resources” track at SIGSPATIAL aiming at mitigating those issues by soliciting papers which make spatial data and related resources available and explorable. Papers submitted to this track should describe the datasets in detail, and/or the process to (re)generate them. Submissions are even more valuable if they show how their data can be combined with other open data (e.g. weather, pollution, etc) for potentially solving richer and/or new problems. Thus we also encourage submissions from communities outside ACM SIGSPATIAL that can impact core SIGSPATIAL problems in a new way. Papers submitted to this track should not only describe in detail the datasets, and/or the processes to (re)generate them, but also what are their context and possibly related problems. In order for this initiative to be effective it is necessary that the described datasets and/or generators are (and remain) openly available in a publicly accessible repository, e.g., GitHub. Submitted papers should have “(Data and Resources Paper)” added to their titles, must be no longer than 4 pages (including references) and, if accepted, they will be presented as posters at SIGSPATIAL 2024.  
 ACM Policy on Authorship  
 Authors should review and follow the ACM Policy on Authorship  which includes guidelines on the use of generative AI software tools  for manuscript writing. In particular, the authors are responsible for all the submitted manuscripts and they should disclose the use of AI software tools in the paper.  
 ACM Policy on Conflict of Interest  
 As part of the submission, you will be asked to mark your conflict-of-interest with the Program Committee members. Authors should review the Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  to decide if there is a conflict of interest. In summary, the following is a non-comprehensive list of examples of COI:  
 All PhD advisors/advisees regardless of the graduation date. 
  All current co-workers or a co-worker in the past 24 months. A co-worker is a person working at the same institution as one of the authors whether or not they actively collaborate | 1 | . 
  Any co-author of a research paper in the last 24 months regardless of whether the paper was peer-reviewed or not, e.g., white papers or arXiv papers also count | 2 | . 
  A research collaborator in the past 24 months whether or not this collaboration resulted in a publication. 
  Close friends or relatives. 
  When in doubt, please reach out to the Program Committee Chairs or mark the potential conflicts on the submission website and add a note on why you think they could be marked as such. The Program Committee Chairs will review them and decide how to use that information. PC Chairs reserve the right to desk-reject a paper without review if COIs are not marked appropriately.  
 1  Short-terms affiliations such as a summer internship does not result in an institutional COI with all co-workers. However, the mentor and other collaborators are still marked.  
 2  Community papers that have a large number of authors and do not stem from a specific research project do not constitute a COI, e.g. the reports titled "Towards Mobility Data Science" and "Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Report" do not by themselves result in a COI.  
 Note on EasyChair: EasyChair does not have a mechanism to mark that there are no COI on a paper. If you confirm that there are not conflicts, then you do not need to submit the COI form.  
 Registration and Presentation  
 Each accepted research, systems, industrial experience, demonstration, data & resources, or vision paper must have a paid author registration (i.e., an author cannot pay a single registration for more than one paper) and one author must attend the conference in person to present the accepted submission. Otherwise, the accepted submission will not appear in the conference proceedings or in the ACM Digital Library version of the conference proceedings.  
 Workshop Proposals  
 One-day and half-day workshops will be held on the first day of the conference. Workshop proposals are to be submitted in PDF format to the Workshops Chairs (call for proposals to be posted). The proceedings of the workshops will appear in the ACM Digital Library. All proposers and organizers of accepted workshops must register for the workshop or the workshop will be canceled.  
 ACM SIGSPATIAL Student Research Competition  
 The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research before a panel of judges and attendees.  
 Programming Contest  
 The ACM SIGSPATIAL CUP 2024, with prizes, is a geospatial-focused algorithm competition in which submissions are to address a specific task proposed by the organizers.

 Interdisciplinary Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab  
 Our lab's mission  is to design and develop effective, efficient, and trustworthy AI algorithms and tools that are inspired by unique challenges from interdisciplinary applications. Our vision  is that future AI research requires the convergence of multiple disciplines, as real-world problems are so complex that one size AI does not fit all. We value  both technical innovations in ML methodologies and tool deployment to solve a real  problem that benefits society.  
 Current research topics  include (but not limited to) spatiotemporal data mining  , geo-foundation models, physics-informed machine learning, graph neural networks, self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning, trustworthy AI (uncertainty, interpretability), large-scale distributed machine learning, as well as interdisciplinary applications in Earth sciences (e.g., hydrology, oceanography, natural disasters), agriculture, transportation and smart cities, health and medicine. Our lab has established collaborations with US Geological Survey, NOAA, NASA, NGA, Los Alamos National Lab, UF Center of Coastal Solutions, and UF College of Medicine.

 The Birkhoff Completion of Finite Lattices  . Abdulla, Mohammad; Hirth, Johannes; Stumme, Gerd I. P. Cabrera, S. Ferré, S. Obiedkov (eds.) (2024). 20–35.    We introduce the Birkhoff completion as the smallest distributive lattice in which a given finite lattice can be embedded as semi-lattice. We discuss its relationship to implicational theories, in particular to R. Wille's simply-implicational theories. By an example, we show how the Birkhoff completion can be used as a tool for ordinal data science. 
  OtterlyObsessedWithSemantics at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Developing a Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification Head for Large Language Models  . Wunderle, Julia; Schubert, Julian; Cacciatore, Antonella; Zehe, Albin; Pfister, Jan; Hotho, Andreas A. K. Ojha, A. S. Dougruöz, H. Tayyar Madabushi, G. Da San Martino, S. Rosenthal, A. Rosá (eds.) (2024). 602–612.    For our submission for Subtask 1, we developed a custom classification head that is designed to be applied atop of a Large Language Model. We reconstructed the hierarchy across multiple fully connected layers, allowing us to incorporate previous foundational decisions in subsequent, more fine-grained layers. To find the best hyperparameters, we conducted a grid-search and to compete in the multilingual setting, we translated all documents to English. 
  One Size Fits All? The Significance of Digital Nursing Documentation for Communication with Patients  . Bringmann, Julia; Petersen, Benjamin Henry; Staab, Philipp (2024). 39–44. 
  The Digitalization of Healthcare for Older Adults: Digitalization as an Answer to Substantial Challenges in our Healthcare System   Herrmann, Wolfram J.; Leser, Ulf; Möller, Sebastian; Voigt-Antons, Jan-Niklas; Gellert, Paul (2024). Berlin Universities Publishing, Berlin.    Demographic change poses substantial challenges for our healthcare system and its ability to sustain good healthcare for older adults. Digitalization is one answer to this challenge. In this collection, we present different projects and approaches tackling the digitalization of healthcare for older adults based on a workshop conducted in Berlin in July 2023. 
  Erste Flugergebnisse der Satellitenmission SONATE-2  . Balagurin, O.; Greiner, T.; Herbst, T.; Kaiser, T.; Kayal, H.; Männel, J.; Maurer, A.; Neumann, T.; Riegler, C.; Schwarz, T. (2024).    SONATE-2 ist eine Technologiedemonstrationsmission im 6U -CubeSat-Format, deren Hauptziel es ist, neuartige Methoden der künstlichen Intelligenz für den Einsatz auf Nanosatelliten im Orbit zu verifizieren. Nach etwa drei Jahren Entwicklungszeit wurde der SONATE-2-Satellit Anfang März 2024 durch eine Falcon-9-Rakete in den Low Earth Orbit befördert und wird seitdem vom eigenen Missionskontrollzentrum der Uni-versität Würzburg betrieben. Dieses Paper fasst die Ergebnisse der ersten fünf Monate des Satellitenbe-triebs zusammen. 
  A Comparative Study of Cooperative and Non-cooperative Wideband Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks for 5g Applications  . Dike, Blessing C. (2024). (Vol. 16) 1–19.    The rapid advancements in 5G technologies have created an unprecedented need for efficient spectrum utilization to support increasing data traffic and diverse communication services. In this context, accurate and reliable spectrum sensing is essential. This study explores wideband spectrum sensing strategies, comparing non-cooperative cognitive radio (CR) techniques with cooperative methods across multiple subbands. A novel cooperative wideband spectrum sensing framework was developed, incorporating a K-outof-N fusion rule at the fusion center to make optimal decisions by selecting an appropriate K for a given number of cooperating CRs. This approach addresses noise uncertainty, a common challenge in traditional non-cooperative energy detection methods, particularly in 5G environments under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions, assumed to be identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.). However, while cooperative sensing significantly improves detection in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios with higher false alarm rates (between 0.5 and 1), our findings reveal that it does not consistently outperform non-cooperative methods at very low false alarm rates (0.01 and 0.1) under poor SNR conditions. These findings highlight the need for further research to enhance cooperative sensing strategies for various operational environments.

  Conceptual Data Scaling in Machine Learning   . Technical Report (PhD dissertation), Hirth, Johannes (2024).    Information that is intended for human interpretation is frequently represented in a structured manner. This allows for a navigation between individual pieces to find, connect or combine information to gain new insights. Within a structure, we derive knowledge from inference of hierarchical or logical relations between data objects. For unstructured data there are numerous methods to define a data schema based on user interpretations. Afterward, data objects can be aggregated to derive (hierarchical) structures based on common properties. There are four main challenges with respect to the explainability of the derived structures. First, formal procedures are needed to infer knowledge about the data set, or parts of it, from hierarchical structures. Second, what does knowledge inferred from a structure imply for the data set it was derived from? Third, structures may be incomprehensibly large for human interpretation. Methods are needed to reduce structures to smaller representations in a consistent, comprehensible manner that provides control over possibly introduced error. Forth, the original data set does not need to have interpretable features and thus only allow for the inference of structural properties. In order to extract information based on real world properties, we need methods that are able to add such properties. With the presented work, we address these challenges using and extending the rich tool-set of Formal Concept Analysis. Here, data objects are aggregated to closed sets called formal concepts based on (unary) symbolic attributes that they have in common. The process of deriving symbolic attributes is called conceptual scaling and depends on the interpretation of the data by the analyst. The resulting hierarchical structure of concepts is called concept lattice. To infer knowledge from the concept lattice structures we introduce new methods based on sub-structures that are of standardized shape, called ordinal motifs. This novel method allows us to explain the structure of a concept lattice based on geometric aspects. Throughout our work, we focus on data representations from multiple state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. In all cases, we elaborate extensively on how to interpret these models through derived concept lattices and develop scaling procedures specific to each algorithm. Some of the considered models are black-box models whose internal data representations are numeric with no clear real world semantics. For these, we present a method to link background knowledge to the concept lattice structure. To reduce the complexity of concept lattices we provide a new theoretical framework that allows us to generate (small) views on a concept lattice. These enable more selective and comprehensibly sized explanations for data parts that are of interest. In addition to that, we introduce methods to combine and subtract views from each other, and to identify missing or incorrect parts.

  Einsatzmöglichkeiten von Kleinsatelliten zur Erforschung von erdnahen Asteroiden am Beispiel von (99942) Apophis  . Männel, J.; Ali, F.; Amza, A.; Herbst, T.; Kayal, H.; Neumann, T.; Riegler, C. (2024).    Bei der Erforschung von Asteroiden kommen zunehmend auch Kleinsatelliten zum Einsatz. Sie werden sowohl als eigenständige Missionen aber auch zur Missionsunterstützung eingesetzt. In Vorbereitung auf den erdnahen Vorbeiflug des Asteroiden (99942) Apophis am 13.04.2029 wurden zahlreiche Missionskonzepte vorgeschlagen, welche den Einsatz von Kleinsatelliten vorsehen. Im Rahmen des laufenden Vorhabens NEAlight (FKZ 50OO2413) werden drei verschiedene Optionen für eine nationale Kleinsatellitenmission zur Erforschung von Apophis (99942) Apophis erarbeitet und deren Machbarkeit analysiert. Die Szenarien umfassen dabei einen CubeSat als Ergänzung zur europäischen RAMSES Mission, Kleinsatelliten zur Demonstration von Flyby Untersuchungen und eine eigenständige Rendevous Mission. 
  A zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10\($^\mathbf-9$\) level  . Patel, D. K.; Fijalkowski, K. M.; Kruskopf, M.; Liu, N.; Götz, M.; Pesel, E.; Jaime, M.; Klement, M.; Schreyeck, S.; Brunner, K.; Gould, C.; Molenkamp, L. W.; Scherer, H. (2024).    The quantum anomalous Hall effect is of potential use in metrology as it provides access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von Klitzing constant (RK\thinspace=\thinspaceh/e2, where h is Planck's constant and e the elementary charge) at zero external magnetic field. However, accessing the effect is challenging because it requires low temperatures (typically below 50\thinspacemK) and low bias currents (typically below 1\thinspace\textmuA). Here we report Hall resistance quantization measurements in the quantum anomalous Hall effect regime on a device based on the magnetic topological insulator V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4\thinspace\textpm\thinspace8.7)\thinspacen\($\Omega$\)\thinspace\($\Omega$\)−1 when extrapolated to zero measurement current and (8.6\thinspace\textpm\thinspace6.7)\thinspacen\($\Omega$\)\thinspace\($\Omega$\)−1 when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k\thinspace=\thinspace1). This precision and accuracy at the n\($\Omega$\)\thinspace\($\Omega$\)−1 level (or 10−9 of relative uncertainty) reach the thresholds required for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance, which is necessary for the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.

  GeaVR: An open-source tools package for geological-structural exploration and data collection using immersive virtual reality  . Bonali, Fabio Luca; Vitello, Fabio; Kearl, Martin; Tibaldi, Alessandro; Whitworth, Malcolm; Antoniou, Varvara; Russo, Elena; Delage, Emmanuel; Nomikou, Paraskevi; Becciani, Ugo; van Wyk de Vries, Benjamin; Krokos, Mel (2024). 21  100156.    We introduce GeaVR, an open-source package containing tools for geological-structural exploration and mapping in Immersive Virtual Reality (VR). GeaVR also makes it possible to carry out quantitative data collection on 3D realistic, referenced and scaled Virtual Reality scenarios. Making use of Immersive Virtual Reality technology through the Unity game engine, GeaVR works with commercially available VR equipment. This allows VR to be accessible to a broad audience, resulting in a revolutionary tool package for Earth Sciences. Users can explore various 3D datasets, spanning from freely available Digital Surface Models and Bathymetric data to ad-hoc 3D high-resolution models from photogrammetry processing. The user can navigate the 3D model in first person, walking or flying above the surrounding environment, mapping the main geological features such as points, lines and polygons, and collecting quantitative data using the provided field survey tools. Such data, including geographic coordinates, can be exported for further spatial analyses. Here we describe three different case studies aimed at showing the potential of our tools. GeaVR is revolutionary as it can be used worldwide, with no spatial limitations, both for geo-education and Earth Science popularization, as well as for research purposes. Secondly, it makes it possible to safely access dangerous areas, such as vertical cliffs or volcanic terrains, virtually from a computer screen or Virtual Reality headset. Furthermore, it can help to reduce carbon emissions by avoiding the use of flights and vehicles to conduct field trips. 
  Disclosing Diverse Perspectives of News Articles for Navigating between Online Journalism Content  . Horn, Viktoria; Hirth, Johannes; Holfeld, Julian; Behmenburg, Jens Hendrik; Draude, Claude; Stumme, Gerd in NordiCHI 2024  (2024).    Today, exposure to journalistic online content is predominantly controlled by news recommender systems, which often suggest content that matches user’s interests or is selected according to non-transparent recommendation criteria. To circumvent resulting trade-offs like polarisation or fragmentation whilst ensuring user’s autonomy, we explore how different perspectives within online news can be disclosed instead for guiding navigation. To do so, we developed an interactive prototype that displays article titles in correspondence to their argumentative orientation. In order to investigate how the usage of our novel navigation structure impacts the choice of news articles and user experience, we conducted an exploratory user study assessing the impact of the design parameters chosen. Implications are drawn from the study results and the development of the interactive prototype for the exposure to diversity in the context of navigating news content online. 
  Conceptual Mapping of Controversies  . Draude, Claude; Dürrschnabel, Dominik; Hirth, Johannes; Horn, Viktoria; Kropf, Jonathan; Lamla, Jörn; Stumme, Gerd; Uhlmann, Markus I. P. Cabrera, S. Ferré, S. Obiedkov (eds.) (2024). 201–216.    With our work, we contribute towards a qualitative analysis of the discourse on controversies in online news media. For this, we employ Formal Concept Analysis and the economics of conventions to derive conceptual controversy maps. In our experiments, we analyze two maps from different news journals with methods from ordinal data science. We show how these methods can be used to assess the diversity, complexity and potential bias of controversies. In addition to that, we discuss how the diagrams of concept lattices can be used to navigate between news articles.

  In-Orbit Validierung des MultiView-Sternsensors auf dem SONATE-2 CubeSat  . Neumann, T.; Balagurin, O.; Kaiser, T.; Kayal, H.; Maurer, A.; Riegler, C.; Schwarz, T. (2024).    Es wurde ein mehrköpfiger Sternsensor für CubeSats für den Einsatz im sog. TunaCanSlot konzipiert. Der Sensor zeichnet sich durch die gegebene Redundanz auf Grund der Verwendung einer Vielzahl an Sensorköpfen trotz des geringen Bauvolumens aus. Im Falle eines Ausfalls oder bei fehlenden Messdaten werden die Sensoren autonom umgeschaltet, die so die Verfügbarkeit der Lagedaten erhöht. Der MultiViewSternsensor wurde an Bord des SONATE2 Nanosatelliten Anfang März 2024 in die Erdumlaufbahn gebracht. Neben anderen Subsystemen als Technologiedemonstration, wurde der Sensor während der Missionslaufzeit in Betrieb genommen und bereits mehreren Tests unterzogen. Damit wird die Raumfahrttauglichkeit sowie der Einsatz im LowEarth Orbit nachgewiesen. In diesem Paper werden die für die Validierung benötigten Aspekte dargestellt. Wichtig sind die Überprüfungen sowohl der Grundfunktionen als Subsystem gegenüber dem Satelliten, als auch der Messprozesse der Sensorköpfe selbst. Die bisherigen Ergebnisse der InOrbitTests werden in Verbindung mit den dargestellten Validierungsaspekten präsentiert. Sie bestätigen die Funktion des Konzeptes und bilden bereits eine gute Grundlage für die in Aussicht gestellte Validierung auf TRL 9.

  Giant topological Hall effect and colossal magnetoresistance in Heusler ferromagnet near room temperature  . Yanda, Premakumar; Noohinejad, Leila; Mao, Ning; Peshcherenko, Nikolai; Imasato, Kazuki; Srivastava, Abhay K.; Guan, Yicheng; Giri, Bimalesh; Sharma, Avdhesh Kumar; Manna, Kaustuv; Parkin, Stuart S. P.; Zhang, Yang; Shekhar, Chandra; Felser, Claudia (2024). n/a  (n/a) 2411240.    Abstract Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is an exotic phenomenon that allows for the efficient magnetic control of electrical resistivity and has attracted significant attention in condensed matter due to its potential for memory and spintronic applications. Heusler alloys are the subject of considerable interest in this context due to the electronic properties that result from the nontrivial band topology. Here, the observation of CMR near room temperature is reported in the shape memory Heusler alloy Ni2Mn1.4In0.6, which is attributed to the combined effects of magnetic field-induced martensite twin variant reorientation (MFIR) and magnetic field-induced structural phase transformation (MFIPT). This compound undergoes a structural phase transition from a cubic (austenite-L21) ferromagnetic (FM) to a monoclinic (martensite) antiferromagnetic (AFM), which leads to an effective increase in the size of the Fermi surface and consequently in CMR. Additionally, it exhibits significant anomalous Hall conductivity in both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. Furthermore, it demonstrates a giant topological Hall resistivity (THR) ρyxT\\($\rho \_\mathrmyx^\mathrmT\$\) ≈6 µΩ.cm in the vicinity of martensite transition due to the enhanced spin chirality resulting from the formation of magnetic domains with Bloch-type domain walls. The findings contribute to the understanding of the magnetotransport of Ni-Mn-In Heusler alloys, which are prospective candidates for room-temperature spintronic applications.

  Reclaiming digital sovereignty: A roadmap to build a digital stack for people and the planet  . Rikap, Cecilia; Durand, Cédric; Paraná, Edemilson; Gerbaudo, Paolo; Marx, Paris (2024).    This policy paper outlines a progressive reform agenda to enhance digital sovereignty for people and the planet with the following 4 key proposals: Offer a democratic, public-led digital stack that shall include: 1) Digital infrastructure as a service (for training, processing and developing digital solutions) provided by non-profit and democratic international consortia; 2) universal platforms, such as search engines and foundation AI models, that should be a commons governed by new public institutions with state and civil society representation; and 3) a public marketplace where companies can offer their computing services without lock-ins. To assure demand, states shall procure from this marketplace and end contracts with Big Tech. Craft a research agenda focused on digital developments that could solve collective problems and enhance human capacities and that consider the ethical, economic, ecological, and political impacts of technology, including of AI applications. For this end, public knowledge networks led by a new public international research agency (or agencies) could counterbalance the concentration of private and closed science. Ground digital sovereignty in an ecological internationalism an antidote to individual government surveillance and power abuses that also minimises the resources needed to build a democratic, public digital stack. Establish strict mechanisms to dismantle state surveillance or misappropriation of collective solutions by specific governments. Multilateral agreements on principles and rules for the internet are indispensable safeguards for building autonomous and democratically governed institutions and solutions. To complement and facilitate all the above, the authors further lay out a strategy on retrofit markets’ authorities for the digital age and implement measures to properly regulate and tax revenues and data and knowledge capture of dominant technology companies. The new policy framework outlined in the paper also aims at protecting labour and enhancing its creative autonomy while contributing to the reinforcement of human and civil rights. One aspect could be a safety net in which states offer training and employment for the development and operation of the public-led digital stack. 
  Changing tasks and changing public servants? The digitalisation and automation of public administrative work  . Gräfe, Philipp; Marienfeldt, Justine; Wehmeier, Liz Marla; Kuhlmann, Sabine (2024).    Due to digitalisation, automation, and the use of artificial intelligence in policy implementation, public administrations are adapting their workflows and organisational structures. We explore the impact of the digital transformation on the nature of tasks as well as the subsequent (potentially) changing demand for competences and job profiles in public executive agencies, based on a comparative case study and semi-structured interviews with over 60 public servants from three key administrative services in Germany – electronic tax returns, internet-based vehicle registrations, and digital building applications. The findings reveal less complex tasks being partially substituted and core discretionary tasks being standardised. We highlight the emergence of “work for digitalisation” that often remains “invisible”, including “compensating work” (scanning, IT support), “connecting work” (software maintenance) and “cleaning work” (validating data), resulting in an overall increased workload. Additionally, there is a need for role-specific new competences and upskilling of middle-level public servants. Our results indicate a potential substitution of traditional administrative job profiles but a growing demand for highly skilled, academically trained public servants. The findings therefore challenge the notion that digitalisation and automation threaten human labour or effectively counteract staff shortages. Rather, (potential) benefits, burdens, and job perspectives are distributed unevenly across job profiles. 
  Defining Knowledge: Bridging Epistemology and Large Language Models  . Fierro, Constanza; Dhar, Ruchira; Stamatiou, Filippos; Garneau, Nicolas; Sogaard, Anders Y. Al-Onaizan, M. Bansal, Y.-N. Chen (eds.) (2024). 16096–16111.    Knowledge claims are abundant in the literature on large language models (LLMs); but can we say that GPT-4 truly ``knows'' the Earth is round? To address this question, we review standard definitions of knowledge in epistemology and we formalize interpretations applicable to LLMs. In doing so, we identify inconsistencies and gaps in how current NLP research conceptualizes knowledge with respect to epistemological frameworks. Additionally, we conduct a survey of 100 professional philosophers and computer scientists to compare their preferences in knowledge definitions and their views on whether LLMs can really be said to know. Finally, we suggest evaluation protocols for testing knowledge in accordance to the most relevant definitions. 
  Photoinduced spin centers in photocatalytic metal–organic framework UiO-66  . Kultaeva, Anastasiia; Biktagirov, Timur; Sperlich, Andreas; Dörflinger, Patrick; Calvo, Mauricio E.; Otal, Eugenio; Dyakonov, Vladimir (2024). n/a  (n/a) 2413297.    Abstract Metal–Organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for advanced photocatalytically active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface areas and structural tunability and are thus highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic processes in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (trPL), the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation are investigated, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. A manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers is detected, which is subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Under UV illumination, the symmetry, g-tensors, and lifetimes of three distinct contributions are revealed: a surface O2-radical, a light-induced electron-hole pair, and a triplet exciton. Notably, the latter is found to emit (delayed) fluorescence. The findings provide new insights into the photoinduced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.

  The Lorenz ratio as a guide to scattering contributions to transport in strongly correlated metals  . Sun, Fei; Mishra, Simli; Stockert, Ulrike; Daou, Ramzy; Kikugawa, Naoki; Perry, Robin S.; Hassinger, Elena; Hartnoll, Sean A.; Mackenzie, Andrew P.; Sunko, Veronika (2024). 121  (35) e2318159121-.    In many strongly correlated metals, resistivities rise more slowly than the Fermi liquid predictions but continue without saturation to very high temperatures, behavior of interest in condensed matter physics and beyond. For example, observations on the scattering rates of such metals are of relevance for comparison with cold atomic systems and the quark?gluon plasma. An open debate is the scattering mechanism that determines the observed phenomena. Using innovative experimental techniques to probe thermal transport in some representative strongly correlated oxide metals, we show that electron?electron scattering dominates, even at room temperature. This emphasizes potential universalities across different fields and guides the quest to understand potential quantum limits to strong scattering in many-body systems. In many physical situations in which many-body assemblies exist at temperature T, a characteristic quantum-mechanical time scale of approximately ?/kBT can be identified in both theory and experiment, leading to speculation that it may be the shortest meaningful time in such circumstances. This behavior can be investigated by probing the scattering rate of electrons in a broad class of materials often referred to as ?strongly correlated metals?. It is clear that in some cases only electron?electron scattering can be its cause, while in others it arises from high-temperature scattering of electrons from quantized lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons. In metallic oxides, which are among the most studied materials, analysis of electrical transport does not satisfactorily identify the relevant scattering mechanism at ?high? temperatures near room temperature. We therefore employ a contactless optical method to measure thermal diffusivity in two Ru-based layered perovskites, Sr3Ru2O7 and Sr2RuO4, and use the measurements to extract the dimensionless Lorenz ratio. By comparing our results to the literature data on both conventional and unconventional metals, we show how the analysis of high-temperature thermal transport can both give important insight into dominant scattering mechanisms and be offered as a stringent test of theories attempting to explain anomalous scattering. 
  Topological semimetals with intrinsic chirality as spin-controlling electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction  . Wang, Xia; Yang, Qun; Singh, Sukriti; Borrmann, Horst; Hasse, Vicky; Yi, Changjiang; Li, Yongkang; Schmidt, Marcus; Li, Xiaodong; Fecher, Gerhard H.; Zhou, Dong; Yan, Binghai; Felser, Claudia (2024).    Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for clean hydrogen production, but the process is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the spin-dependent electron transfer process. Efforts to control spin through chirality and magnetization have shown potential in enhancing OER performance. Here we harnessed the potential of topological chiral semimetals (RhSi, RhSn and RhBiS) and their spin-polarized Fermi surfaces to promote the spin-dependent electron transfer in the OER, addressing the traditional volcano-plot limitations. We show that OER activities follow the trend RhSithinspace

  Ordinal Motifs in Lattices  . Hirth, Johannes; Horn, Viktoria; Stumme, Gerd; Hanika, Tom (2023). 120009.    Lattices are a commonly used structure for the representation and analysis of relational and ontological knowledge. In particular, the analysis of these requires a decomposition of a large and high-dimensional lattice into a set of understandably large parts. With the present work we propose /ordinal motifs/ as analytical units of meaning. We study these ordinal substructures (or standard scales) through (full) scale-measures of formal contexts from the field of formal concept analysis. We show that the underlying decision problems are NP-complete and provide results on how one can incrementally identify ordinal motifs to save computational effort. Accompanying our theoretical results, we demonstrate how ordinal motifs can be leveraged to retrieve basic meaning from a medium sized ordinal data set. 
  Underwater 3D Reconstruction from Video or Still Imagery: Matisse and 3DMetrics Processing and Exploitation Software  . Arnaubec, Aurélien; Ferrera, Maxime; Escartín, Javier; Matabos, Marjolaine; Gracias, Nuno; Opderbecke, Jan (2023). 11  (5)    This paper addresses the lack of “push-button” software for optical marine imaging, which currently limits the use of photogrammetric approaches by a wider community. It presents and reviews an open source software, Matisse, for creating textured 3D models of complex underwater scenes from video or still images. This software, developed for non-experts, enables routine and efficient processing of underwater images into 3D models that facilitate the exploitation and analysis of underwater imagery. When vehicle navigation data are available, Matisse allows for seamless integration of such data to produce 3D reconstructions that are georeferenced and properly scaled. The software includes pre-processing tools to extract images from videos and to make corrections for color and uneven lighting. Four datasets of different 3D scenes are provided for demonstration. They include both input images and navigation and associated 3D models generated with Matisse. The datasets, captured under different survey geometries, lead to 3D models of different sizes and demonstrate the capabilities of the software. The software suite also includes a 3D scene analysis tool, 3DMetrics, which can be used to visualize 3D scenes, incorporate elevation terrain models (e.g., from high-resolution bathymetry data) and manage, extract, and export quantitative measurements for the 3D data analysis. Both software packages are publicly available. 
  Conceptual Views on Tree Ensemble Classifiers  . Hanika, Tom; Hirth, Johannes (2023). 108930.    Random Forests and related tree-based methods are popular for supervised learning from table based data. Apart from their ease of parallelization, their classification performance is also superior. However, this performance, especially parallelizability, is offset by the loss of explainability. Statistical methods are often used to compensate for this disadvantage. Yet, their ability for local explanations, and in particular for global explanations, is limited. In the present work we propose an algebraic method, rooted in lattice theory, for the (global) explanation of tree ensembles. In detail, we introduce two novel conceptual views on tree ensemble classifiers and demonstrate their explanatory capabilities on Random Forests that were trained with standard parameters.

  Automatic Textual Explanations of Concept Lattices  . Hirth, Johannes; Horn, Viktoria; Stumme, Gerd; Hanika, Tom M. Ojeda-Aciego, K. Sauerwald, R. Jäschke (eds.) (2023). 138–152.    Lattices and their order diagrams are an essential tool for communicating knowledge and insights about data. This is in particular true when applying Formal Concept Analysis. Such representations, however, are difficult to comprehend by untrained users and in general in cases where lattices are large. We tackle this problem by automatically generating textual explanations for lattices using standard scales. Our method is based on the general notion of ordinal motifs in lattices for the special case of standard scales. We show the computational complexity of identifying a small number of standard scales that cover most of the lattice structure. For these, we provide textual explanation templates, which can be applied to any occurrence of a scale in any data domain. These templates are derived using principles from human-computer interaction and allow for a comprehensive textual explanation of lattices. We demonstrate our approach on the spices planner data set, which is a medium sized formal context comprised of fifty-six meals (objects) and thirty-seven spices (attributes). The resulting 531 formal concepts can be covered by means of about 100 standard scales.

  GPM: A graph convolutional network based reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management  . Shi, Si; Li, Jianjun; Li, Guohui; Pan, Peng; Chen, Qi; Sun, Qing (2022). 498  14–27.    Portfolio management is a decision-making process of periodically reallocating a certain amount of funds into a portfolio of assets, with the objective of maximizing the profits constrained to a given risk level. Due to its nature of learning from dynamic interactions and planning for long-run performance, reinforcement learning (RL) recently has received much attention in portfolio management. However, most of existing RL-based PM approaches in general only consider price changes of portfolio assets and the implicit correlations between price changes, while ignoring the rich relations between companies in the market, such as two assets in the same sector or two companies have a supplier-customer relation, which are very important for trading decision making. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose GPM, a novel graph convolutional network-based reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management, which first employs Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to extract asset relational features, and then combines relational features with multi-scale temporal features to make trading decisions for better performance. We also introduce softmax with temperature to increase portfolio diversity, which leads to further increase in profits. Experimental results on two real-world datasets: NASDAQ and NYSE, validate the effectiveness of GPM over state-of-the-art PM methods. Further, more experiments are conducted to evaluate GPM with different graph neural networks and different number of network layers, to explore proper settings for different markets. 
  How Academics and the Public Experienced Immersive Virtual Reality for Geo-Education  . Bonali, Fabio L.; Russo, Elena; Vitello, Fabio; Antoniou, Varvara; Marchese, Fabio; Fallati, Luca; Bracchi, Valentina; Corti, Noemi; Savini, Alessandra; Whitworth, Malcolm; Drymoni, Kyriaki; Mariotto, Federico Pasquaré; Nomikou, Paraskevi; Sciacca, Eva; Bressan, Sofia; Falsaperla, Susanna; Reitano, Danilo; van Wyk de Vries, Benjamin; Krokos, Mel; Panieri, Giuliana; Stiller-Reeve, Mathew Alexander; Vizzari, Giuseppe; Becciani, Ugo; Tibaldi, Alessandro (2022). 12  (1)    Immersive virtual reality can potentially open up interesting geological sites to students, academics and others who may not have had the opportunity to visit such sites previously. We study how users perceive the usefulness of an immersive virtual reality approach applied to Earth Sciences teaching and communication. During nine immersive virtual reality-based events held in 2018 and 2019 in various locations (Vienna in Austria, Milan and Catania in Italy, Santorini in Greece), a large number of visitors had the opportunity to navigate, in immersive mode, across geological landscapes reconstructed by cutting-edge, unmanned aerial system-based photogrammetry techniques. The reconstructed virtual geological environments are specifically chosen virtual geosites, from Santorini (Greece), the North Volcanic Zone (Iceland), and Mt. Etna (Italy). Following the user experiences, we collected 459 questionnaires, with a large spread in participant age and cultural background. We find that the majority of respondents would be willing to repeat the immersive virtual reality experience, and importantly, most of the students and Earth Science academics who took part in the navigation confirmed the usefulness of this approach for geo-education purposes. 
  The use of immersive virtual reality for teaching fieldwork skills in complex structural terrains  . Harknett, J.; Whitworth, M.; Rust, D.; Krokos, M.; Kearl, M.; Tibaldi, A.; Bonali, F.L.; Van Wyk de Vries, B.; Antoniou, V.; Nomikou, P.; Reitano, D.; Falsaperla, S.; Vitello, F.; Becciani, U. (2022). 163  104681.    Innovations in virtual reality (VR) technology have led to exciting possibilities in teaching earth sciences, allowing students to experience complex geological sites that, due to cost and logistical reasons, they would not normally be able to experience. The need for high quality online digital learning resources and blended learning was brought to the forefront during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as courses with a traditional physical field work component were forced to move online and provide alternatives to students. While it is unlikely that virtual field trips (VFT) would be accepted by students as a replacement of real-world fieldwork moving out of the pandemic, research shows promise that using IVR experiences can lead to enhanced learning outcomes in geosciences, warranting its inclusion on the curricula. This paper presents the outputs of a project to improve student learning in complex geological environments using VR. Here we outline a workflow that was developed to collect high resolution imagery using remote sensing to create digital outcrop models (DOM) of complex geological sites. Using this framework, this paper will then explore the use of VR for an investigation of the Husavik Triple Junction, a complex structural site in northern Iceland, explaining how the drone data was converted to a 3D DOM and demonstrating how VR can be used to simulate real world field mapping. Finally, we describe how these IVR activities have been integrated into taught modules at postgraduate level and discuss how the use of IVR experiences can complement existing geoscience curriculum design.

  Knowledge cores in large formal contexts  . Hanika, Tom; Hirth, Johannes (2022).    Knowledge computation tasks, such as computing a base of valid implications, are often infeasible for large data sets. This is in particular true when deriving canonical bases in formal concept analysis (FCA). Therefore, it is necessary to find techniques that on the one hand reduce the data set size, but on the other hand preserve enough structure to extract useful knowledge. Many successful methods are based on random processes to reduce the size of the investigated data set. This, however, makes them hardly interpretable with respect to the discovered knowledge. Other approaches restrict themselves to highly supported subsets and omit rare and (maybe) interesting patterns. An essentially different approach is used in network science, called k-cores. These cores are able to reflect rare patterns, as long as they are well connected within the data set. In this work, we study k-cores in the realm of FCA by exploiting the natural correspondence of bi-partite graphs and formal contexts. This structurally motivated approach leads to a comprehensible extraction of knowledge cores from large formal contexts. 
  On the lattice of conceptual measurements  . Hanika, Tom; Hirth, Johannes (2022). 613  453–468.    We present a novel approach for data set scaling based on scale-measures from formal concept analysis, i.e., continuous maps between closure systems, for which we derive a canonical representation. Moreover, we prove that scale-measures can be lattice ordered using the canonical representation. This enables exploring the set of scale-measures by the use of meet and join operations. Furthermore we show that the lattice of scale-measures is isomorphic to the lattice of sub-closure systems that arises from the original data. Finally, we provide another representation of scale-measures using propositional logic in terms of data set features. Our theoretical findings are discussed by means of examples.

  Research Topic Flows in Co-Authorship Networks  . Schäfermeier, Bastian; Hirth, Johannes; Hanika, Tom (2022).    In scientometrics, scientific collaboration is often analyzed by means of co-authorships. An aspect which is often overlooked and more difficult to quantify is the flow of expertise between authors from different research topics, which is an important part of scientific progress. With the Topic Flow Network (TFN) we propose a graph structure for the analysis of research topic flows between scientific authors and their respective research fields. Based on a multi-graph and a topic model, our proposed network structure accounts for intratopic as well as intertopic flows. Our method requires for the construction of a TFN solely a corpus of publications (i.e., author and abstract information). From this, research topics are discovered automatically through non-negative matrix factorization. The thereof derived TFN allows for the application of social network analysis techniques, such as common metrics and community detection. Most importantly, it allows for the analysis of intertopic flows on a large, macroscopic scale, i.e., between research topic, as well as on a microscopic scale, i.e., between certain sets of authors. We demonstrate the utility of TFNs by applying our method to two comprehensive corpora of altogether 20 Mio. publications spanning more than 60 years of research in the fields computer science and mathematics. Our results give evidence that TFNs are suitable, e.g., for the analysis of topical communities, the discovery of important authors in different fields, and, most notably, the analysis of intertopic flows, i.e., the transfer of topical expertise. Besides that, our method opens new directions for future research, such as the investigation of influence relationships between research fields.

  INSOMNIA: Towards Concept-Drift Robustness in Network Intrusion Detection  . Andresini, Giuseppina; Pendlebury, Feargus; Pierazzi, Fabio; Loglisci, Corrado; Appice, Annalisa; Cavallaro, Lorenzo in AISec ’21  (2021). 111–122.    Despite decades of research in network traffic analysis and incredible advances in artificial intelligence, network intrusion detection systems based on machine learning (ML) have yet to prove their worth. One core obstacle is the existence of concept drift, an issue for all adversary-facing security systems. Additionally, specific challenges set intrusion detection apart from other ML-based security tasks, such as malware detection.In this work, we offer a new perspective on these challenges. We propose INSOMNIA, a semi-supervised intrusion detector which continuously updates the underlying ML model as network traffic characteristics are affected by concept drift. We use active learning to reduce latency in the model updates, label estimation to reduce labeling overhead, and apply explainable AI to better interpret how the model reacts to the shifting distribution.To evaluate INSOMNIA, we extend TESSERACT - a framework originally proposed for performing sound time-aware evaluations of ML-based malware detectors - to the network intrusion domain. Our evaluation shows that accounting for drifting scenarios is vital for effective intrusion detection systems.

  Virtual Geosite Communication through a WebGIS Platform: A Case Study from Santorini Island (Greece)  . Pasquaré Mariotto, Federico; Antoniou, Varvara; Drymoni, Kyriaki; Bonali, Fabio Luca; Nomikou, Paraskevi; Fallati, Luca; Karatzaferis, Odysseas; Vlasopoulos, Othonas (2021). 11  (12)    We document and show a state-of-the-art methodology that could allow geoheritage sites (geosites) to become accessible to scientific and non-scientific audiences through immersive and non-immersive virtual reality applications. This is achieved through a dedicated WebGIS platform, particularly handy in communicating geoscience during the COVID-19 era. For this application, we selected nine volcanic outcrops in Santorini, Greece. The latter are mainly associated with several geological processes (e.g., dyking, explosive, and effusive eruptions). In particular, they have been associated with the famous Late Bronze Age (LBA) eruption, which made them ideal for geoheritage popularization objectives since they combine scientific and educational purposes with geotourism applications. Initially, we transformed these stunning volcanological outcrops into geospatial models—the so called virtual outcrops (VOs) here defined as virtual geosites (VGs)—through UAV-based photogrammetry and 3D modeling. In the next step, we uploaded them on an online platform that is fully accessible for Earth science teaching and communication. The nine VGs are currently accessible on a PC, a smartphone, or a tablet. Each one includes a detailed description and plenty of annotations available for the viewers during 3D exploration. We hope this work will be regarded as a forward model application for Earth sciences’ popularization and make geoheritage open to the scientific community and the lay public.

  Virtual Geosites as Innovative Tools for Geoheritage Popularization: A Case Study from Eastern Iceland  . Pasquaré Mariotto, Federico; Bonali, Fabio Luca (2021). 11  (4)    In this paper, we have adopted a modern, cutting-edge methodology to make geoheritage sites (geosites) available and explorable worldwide, through both immersive and non-immersive virtual reality, particularly suitable also in COVID-19 times. In doing this, we have focused our attention on five different outcroppings, shallow magma bodies in Iceland: such geological objects, although being often underestimated, are, on the contrary, very suitable for geoheritage popularization purposes. These outstanding outcrops have been transformed in virtual outcrops (VOs) through UAV-based photogrammetry 3D modelling, and have been uploaded on a brand-new, dedicated online resource (GeoVires Virtual Reality Lab for Earth Sciences) which is accessible worldwide for Earth Science teaching and communication. As already stressed above, the choice of these Icelandic shallow magma bodies has been suggested by the fact that such geological objects, although extraordinarily challenging both in terms of geotourism and teaching, are seldom the object of attention from the international scientific community. The five VOs are defined here as virtual geosites (VGs) because they are, indeed, geosites that are fully accessible with a smartphone, a tablet, or a PC; moreover, each is provided with a detailed description and notes available during 3D exploration. Our work could represent a model for future, similar efforts aimed at popularizing Earth Sciences and making geoheritage available to a broad public through VGs. 
  Sarcasm Detection Beyond using Lexical Features  . Gotham, Mark; Kleinertz, Rainer; Weiß, Christof; Müller, Meinard; Klauk, Stephanie A. J. Oluwaseyi, O. I. David (eds.) (2020). (Vol. 12) 41–53.    In current time, social media websites such as facebook, twitter, and so forth have improved and received substantial importance. These websites have grown into huge environments wherein users explicit their thoughts, perspectives and reviews evidently. Organizations leverage this environment to tap into people’s opinion on their services and to make a quick feedback. This research seeks to keep away from using grammatical words as the only features for sarcasm detection however also the contextual features, which are theories explaining when, how and why sarcasm is expressed. A deep neural network architecture model was employed to carry out this task, which is a bidirectional long short-term memory with conditional random fields (Bi-LSTM-CRF), two stages were employed to classify if a reply or comment to a tweet is sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure. 
  Integrating Virtual Reality and GIS Tools for Geological Mapping, Data Collection and Analysis: An Example from the Metaxa Mine, Santorini (Greece)  . Antoniou, Varvara; Bonali, Fabio Luca; Nomikou, Paraskevi; Tibaldi, Alessandro; Melissinos, Paraskevas; Mariotto, Federico Pasquaré; Vitello, Fabio Roberto; Krokos, Mel; Whitworth, Malcolm (2020). 10  (23)    In the present work we highlight the effectiveness of integrating different techniques and tools for better surveying, mapping and collecting data in volcanic areas. We use an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) approach for data collection, integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis in a well-known volcanological site in Santorini (Metaxa mine), a site where volcanic processes influenced the island’s industrial development, especially with regard to pumice mining. Specifically, we have focused on: (i) three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution IVR scenario building, based on Structure from Motion photogrammetry (SfM) modeling; (ii) subsequent geological survey, mapping and data collection using IVR; (iii) data analysis, e.g., calculation of extracted volumes, as well as production of new maps in a GIS environment using input data directly from the IVR survey; and finally, (iv) presentation of new outcomes that highlight the importance of the Metaxa Mine as a key geological and volcanological geosite. 
  3D digital outcrop model reconstruction of the Kimberley outcrop (Gale crater, Mars) and its integration into Virtual Reality for simulated geological analysis  . Caravaca, Gwénaël; Le Mouélic, Stéphane; Mangold, Nicolas; L’Haridon, Jonas; Le Deit, Laetitia; Massé, Marion (2020). 182  104808.    Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry has recently become a cheap and efficient method to reconstruct accurate and highly-resolved 3D Digital Outcrop Model (DOM) from a single set of images. This enables the 3D visualization of hardly accessible and/or remote geological scenes, which is of strong interest for planetary bodies. This paper focuses on the reconstruction of the DOM of the Kimberley outcrop (Gale crater, Mars) using the Agisoft PhotoScan Professional software. This software is used to compute an accurate, scaled and georeferenced 3D mesh of this outcrop from set of multi-scale images taken by the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity. This model was merged with a 3D model computed from orbital images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera (HiRISE) to provide the context. One of the challenges is to integrate data coming from different cameras (with varying optical parameters) not specifically designed for 3D rendering, and with limited points of views. While the obtained DOM allows to observe and characterize geological features of Kimberley’s sedimentary series, classic viewing methods through a 2D screen limits the understanding of the real 3D geometry and scale of the outcrop, as there is no feature such as trees or roads on Mars to provide size references to the user. To overcome this issue and facilitate the interpretation of the DOM, the latter is integrated into a Virtual Reality (VR) environment that enables one or several users working in a collaborative mode to experience a real scale, reliable and realistic depiction of the actual geometries of the geological features reconstructed on the mesh. Precise and accurate description, contextualization of the samplings and mapping of the Kimberley outcrop can therefore be achieved in VR allowing for more precise characterization and interpretations, the same way one would do on a real geological field trip.

  An Analysis of Surface and Growth Differences in Plants of Different Stages Using Image Processing  . Faizur Rashid, Tamirat Delesa (F. Rashid, ed.) (2019). 9  (4) 7.    Genomes are main reason for growth and surface differences in the plants. All plants grow on basis of their different surrounding like soil, water, breed of seed, and climatic session. This paper attempts to find stem growth from birth to maturity level of selected plant using image processing technique. Few reasons have been observed commonly by the researchers that some plants could not grow sufficiently as to the other plants of similar breed and age. Images were taken of different stage of bean plant and images of some other plant samples were also included for better assessment. Researchers are trying to understand through their calculative analysis by image processing emulator in MATLAB to view its reasons.Suitable comparison technique is applied to detect their period of growth. Image processing methods like Restoration, stem or leaves spots, filtering, and plant comparison have applied in MATLAB.Those effects that are not supporting to grow the plants of their similar age group are matter to calculate scientifically later in the future. The observation would help for further support in medicinal science or agriculturalscience of plant and Bio-chemical.

  First direct observation of coseismic slip and seafloor rupture along a submarine normal fault and implications for fault slip history  . Escartín, Javier; Leclerc, Frédérique; Olive, Jean-Arthur; Mevel, Catherine; Cannat, Mathilde; Petersen, Sven; Augustin, Nico; Feuillet, Nathalie; Deplus, Christine; Bezos, Antoine; Bonnemains, Diane; Chavagnac, Valérie; Choi, Yujin; Godard, Marguerite; Haaga, Kristian A.; Hamelin, Cédric; Ildefonse, Benoit; Jamieson, John W.; John, Barbara E.; Leleu, Thomas; MacLeod, Christopher J.; Massot-Campos, Miquel; Nomikou, Paraskevi; Paquet, Marine; Rommevaux-Jestin, Céline; Rothenbeck, Marcel; Steinführer, Anja; Tominaga, Masako; Triebe, Lars; Campos, Ricard; Gracias, Nuno; Garcia, Rafael; Andreani, Muriel; Vilaseca, Géraud (2016). 450  96–107.    Properly assessing the extent and magnitude of fault ruptures associated with large earthquakes is critical for understanding fault behavior and associated hazard. Submarine faults can trigger tsunamis, whose characteristics are defined by the geometry of seafloor displacement, studied primarily through indirect observations (e.g., seismic event parameters, seismic profiles, shipboard bathymetry, coring) rather than direct ones. Using deep-sea vehicles, we identify for the first time a marker of coseismic slip on a submarine fault plane along the Roseau Fault (Lesser Antilles), and measure its vertical displacement of ∼0.9 m in situ. We also map recent fissuring and faulting of sediments on the hangingwall, along ∼3 km of rupture in close proximity to the fault's base, and document the reactivation of erosion and sedimentation within and downslope of the scarp. These deformation structures were caused by the 2004 Mw 6.3 Les Saintes earthquake, which triggered a subsequent tsunami. Their characterization informs estimates of earthquake recurrence on this fault and provides new constraints on the geometry of fault rupture, which is both shorter and displays locally larger coseismic displacements than available model predictions that lack field constraints. This methodology of detailed field observations coupled with near-bottom geophysical surveying can be readily applied to numerous submarine fault systems, and should prove useful in evaluating seismic and tsunamigenic hazard in all geodynamic contexts.

 ACM Case Studies   
 Written by leading domain experts for software engineers, ACM Case Studies provide an in-depth look at how software teams overcome specific challenges by implementing new technologies, adopting new practices, or a combination of both. Often through first-hand accounts, these pieces explore what the challenges were, the tools and techniques that were used to combat them, and the solution that was achieved.

 Almost perfect   
 If i could give it 4.5 I would but I'm much more inclined to say I'm happy with this product. Really good quality, excellent resource for my vet suturing practice. I have a mild complaint about the silk sutures, they rip/ fray more easily than I hoped, but easily rectified by buying new ones (which are cheap) and also encourages me to be more gentle with my knots. I'm so happy with it and it's a perfect still revising break from studying. Thank you Sim and Skills!!!

 Feedback from university students and lecturers   
 Student Feedback: Feedback was gathered from 13 students. Overall, they liked the trainer and would recommend it to their peers for learning blood glucose testing. They found the trainer easy to use and helpful in demonstrating the procedure. The students felt that the trainer added significant value to their training, with the main benefit being an increased competency in blood glucose testing.  
 Lecturer Feedback: Feedback was collected from 7 lecturers. Most of them found the trainer to be authentic and effective in simulating the challenges of blood sugar testing. They appreciated that it encouraged patient communication, which is a great plus. The product was of good quality and reliable for teaching purposes. However, there was a minor issue with the finger becoming leaky after multiple uses. Despite this, the lecturers agreed that the trainer prepares students well for real-world blood glucose testing.

 Excellent hand model   
 As a proud owner of a Sim & Skills Foot & Ankle model, I thought it was time I invested in a Hand & Wrist.  
 My clients find it really helpful when we are discussing anatomy and it really aids their recovery.  
 I believe client education and knowing that your body is something to be enjoyed, not feared, is such an important platform for recovery from chronic pain.

 Useful piece of equipment   
 This item is very useful for NG insertion training, it can be used in a horizontal position and the fluid bag does not leak out. The bag and tubing can all be stored within the head making storage of the item easy. It is very simple to use and the head is strong and durable

  SIROCCO 2025  

 2024-10-31: To compensate for the unexpected server outage of EasyChair, the abstract submission deadline has been extended by one day to Nov 2, 2024 (AoE).  

 General Information  
 The 32nd International Colloquium On Structural Information and Communications Complexity (SIROCCO 2025) will take place on June 2-4, 2025, in Delphi, Greece. See the Call for Papers  for more information about the scope and submission instructions.  

 About SIROCCO  
 SIROCCO is devoted to the study of the interplay between structural knowledge, communication, and computing in decentralized systems of multiple communicating entities. Special emphasis is given to innovative methodological and solution approaches leading to a better understanding of the relationship between computing and communication.  

 Keynote Speakers   
 Three distinguished keynote speakers   
 Hagit Attiya, Technion 
  Joseph Y. Halpern, Cornell University 
  Christos Papadimitriou, Columbia University 
  will present their view of the future of scientific research in their fields, particularly the challenges and threats posed by recent developments in computer science, engineering, and academic research and education.   

 Venue  
 SIROCCO 2025 will take place in the historic town of Delphi  (external link)   , Greece, at the European Cultural Centre of Delphi  (external link)   . This UNESCO World Heritage site  (external link)   , once home to the oracle of Apollo and the omphalos, the 'navel of the world', is renowned for its profound blend of natural beauty and sacred history. Known as the seat of the high priestess Pythia of the Temple of Apollo, Delphi was considered the center of the world by the ancient Greeks, primarily due to the Oracle of Delphi where the priestess dispensed prophecies. Conveniently located just a few hours’ drive from Athens, Delphi is easily accessible for international attendees. Participants will enjoy breathtaking views of the Amphissa Olive Grove  (external link)   and the Itea Bay from the Centre’s guest rooms  (external link)   , which are equipped with modern amenities. Additionally, Delphi hosts the renowned Delphi Archaeological Museum  (external link)   , one of Greece’s most visited cultural treasures.

 Prof. Sridevan Parameswaran  
 Keynote-1: Day-1, Monday, 2nd December 2024, 9.15 AM- 10.00 AM  
  Topic: Side channel Attacks, Remote Power Attacks and Countermeasures  
  Professor Sridevan Parameswaran, The University of Sydney, Australia  
   
 Deep devastation is felt when privacy is breached, personal information is lost, or property is stolen. Now imagine when all of this happens at once, and the victim is unaware of its occurrence until much later. This is the reality, as an increasing number of electronic devices are used as keys, wallets and files. Security attacks targeting embedded systems illegally gain access to information or destroy information. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used to protect many of these embedded systems. While mathematically shown to be quite secure, it is now well known that AES circuits and software implementations are vulnerable to side channel attacks. Side-channel attacks are performed by observing properties of the system (such as power consumption electromagnetic emission, etc.) while the system performs cryptographic operations. In this talk, differing power-based attacks are described and various countermeasures are explained. A countermeasure titled Algorithmic Balancing is described in detail. Implementation of this countermeasure in hardware and software is described. Since process variation impairs countermeasures we show how this countermeasure can be made to overcome process variations. In the next part of the talk Remote power attacks are described and novel sensors are demonstrated which enable stealthy deployment of attacks on Cloud based FPGAs (such as the Amazon Cloud FPGA).

 Keynote-2: Day-2, Tuesday, 3rd December 2024, 9.00 AM- 9.45 AM  
  Topic: Establishing Trustworthy Data Sharing and Use Frameworks  
  Dr. Ian Oppermann, University of Technology Sydney  
   
 Data is the lifeblood of the modern economy. It impacts, enables and personalises how we work, play and engage socially and is also crucial for the operation of government and the economy. Banks and financial services companies can be described as data and digital services organisations with some bricks and mortar operations. Value comes from creating, using, protecting and sharing data. Use of data is a very wide and vague topic incorporating analysis, storage, aggregation, dissemination and deletion. The value of data is unleashed through sharing. The challenge within any sharing or use relationship is “can I trust the data or data product you have tried to share with me?”. When that data product is a chart or an analytical insight it is easier to apply tests on source of origin, governance and methods of analysis. When the data product is the output of complex AI systems there is little in the way of frameworks to test the image, video, voice message or other generated result. This keynote seeks to outline frameworks which help answer important questions about data and products derived from data: How can I determine if data is fit for the purposes, I plan to use it for? How can I provide guidance / restrictions / prohibitions for future uses of the products I create from this data? How can I enforce restrictions / prohibitions for future uses of the products I create from data? How can I determine if a data product has been manipulated in ways that I did not expect?

  Topic: Election verification for computer scientists  
  Dr. Vanessa Teague, CEO, Thinking Cybersecurity Pty. Ltd  
   
 In this talk we will discuss some good ideas for election verification and evidence as well as some recent examples of practical failures. We'll discuss the state of election security in Australia and possibly the USA, and think about what technologists can do to improve the situation.  
 Brief Bio:  Dr Vanessa Teague is an Associate Professor (Adjunct.) at the ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics. Dr Teague is a cryptographer living and working on Wurundjeri land in southeastern Australia (near Melbourne). She is interested in cryptographic protocols that support a free and democratic society. She works on openly-available research and open-source software for supporting democratic decision making and empowering ordinary people to make choices about their own data. Dr Teague’s research focuses primarily on cryptographic methods for achieving security and privacy, particularly for issues of public interest such as election integrity and the protection of government data. She was part of the team (with Chris Culnane and Ben Rubinstein) who discovered the easy re-identification of doctors and patients in the Medicare/PBS open dataset released by the Australian Department of Health. Joint work with Andrew Conway has identified several errors in deployed official Australian STV vote counting software, most of which was corrected as a consequence. She has co-designed numerous protocols for improved election integrity in e-voting systems, and co-discovered serious weaknesses in the cryptography of deployed e-voting systems in New South Wales, Western Australia and Switzerland.

 Prof. Willy Susilo  
 Keynote-4: Day-3, Wednesday, 4th December 2024, 9.00 AM- 9.45 AM  
  Topic: Cloud Computing Security: Past, Present and Future  
  Professor Willy Susilo, University of Wollongong  
   
 Cloud computing is considered as one of the most prominent paradigms in the information technology industry, since it can significantly reduce the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure. This convenience has enabled corporations to efficiently use cloud storage as a mechanism to share data and cloud computing as a mechanism to outsource computing. One of the most important works in the area of cloud computing is how to provide security protections. The work in the cryptography literature has been very rich in this area, as it has been studied in the past two decades. In this lecture, we will revisit the topics that researchers have been studying. Specifically, we will provide an overview on what research topic that was studied, and currently being studied in the literature. We provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing research based on the published papers spanning from 2007 to 2023. Furthermore, we also discuss the gap between theory and the implementation of the proposed solutions.

 Prof. Sridevan Parameswaran  
 Keynote-1: Day-1, Monday, 2nd December 2024, 9.15 AM- 10.00 AM  
  Topic: Side channel Attacks, Remote Power Attacks and Countermeasures  
  Professor Sridevan Parameswaran, The University of Sydney, Australia  
   
 Deep devastation is felt when privacy is breached, personal information is lost, or property is stolen. Now imagine when all of this happens at once, and the victim is unaware of its occurrence until much later. This is the reality, as an increasing number of electronic devices are used as keys, wallets and files. Security attacks targeting embedded systems illegally gain access to information or destroy information. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used to protect many of these embedded systems. While mathematically shown to be quite secure, it is now well known that AES circuits and software implementations are vulnerable to side channel attacks. Side-channel attacks are performed by observing properties of the system (such as power consumption electromagnetic emission, etc.) while the system performs cryptographic operations. In this talk, differing power-based attacks are described and various countermeasures are explained. A countermeasure titled Algorithmic Balancing is described in detail. Implementation of this countermeasure in hardware and software is described. Since process variation impairs countermeasures we show how this countermeasure can be made to overcome process variations. In the next part of the talk Remote power attacks are described and novel sensors are demonstrated which enable stealthy deployment of attacks on Cloud based FPGAs (such as the Amazon Cloud FPGA).

  Topic: Establishing Trustworthy Data Sharing and Use Frameworks  
  Dr. Ian Oppermann, University of Technology Sydney  
   
 Data is the lifeblood of the modern economy. It impacts, enables and personalises how we work, play and engage socially and is also crucial for the operation of government and the economy. Banks and financial services companies can be described as data and digital services organisations with some bricks and mortar operations. Value comes from creating, using, protecting and sharing data. Use of data is a very wide and vague topic incorporating analysis, storage, aggregation, dissemination and deletion. The value of data is unleashed through sharing. The challenge within any sharing or use relationship is “can I trust the data or data product you have tried to share with me?”. When that data product is a chart or an analytical insight it is easier to apply tests on source of origin, governance and methods of analysis. When the data product is the output of complex AI systems there is little in the way of frameworks to test the image, video, voice message or other generated result. This keynote seeks to outline frameworks which help answer important questions about data and products derived from data: How can I determine if data is fit for the purposes, I plan to use it for? How can I provide guidance / restrictions / prohibitions for future uses of the products I create from this data? How can I enforce restrictions / prohibitions for future uses of the products I create from data? How can I determine if a data product has been manipulated in ways that I did not expect?

 Keynote-3: Day-2, Tuesday, 3rd December 2024, 9.45 AM- 10.30 AM  
  Topic: Election verification for computer scientists  
  Dr. Vanessa Teague, CEO, Thinking Cybersecurity Pty. Ltd  
   
 In this talk we will discuss some good ideas for election verification and evidence as well as some recent examples of practical failures. We'll discuss the state of election security in Australia and possibly the USA, and think about what technologists can do to improve the situation.  
 Brief Bio:  Dr Vanessa Teague is an Associate Professor (Adjunct.) at the ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics. Dr Teague is a cryptographer living and working on Wurundjeri land in southeastern Australia (near Melbourne). She is interested in cryptographic protocols that support a free and democratic society. She works on openly-available research and open-source software for supporting democratic decision making and empowering ordinary people to make choices about their own data. Dr Teague’s research focuses primarily on cryptographic methods for achieving security and privacy, particularly for issues of public interest such as election integrity and the protection of government data. She was part of the team (with Chris Culnane and Ben Rubinstein) who discovered the easy re-identification of doctors and patients in the Medicare/PBS open dataset released by the Australian Department of Health. Joint work with Andrew Conway has identified several errors in deployed official Australian STV vote counting software, most of which was corrected as a consequence. She has co-designed numerous protocols for improved election integrity in e-voting systems, and co-discovered serious weaknesses in the cryptography of deployed e-voting systems in New South Wales, Western Australia and Switzerland.

 Prof. Willy Susilo  
 Keynote-4: Day-3, Wednesday, 4th December 2024, 9.00 AM- 9.45 AM  
  Topic: Cloud Computing Security: Past, Present and Future  
  Professor Willy Susilo, University of Wollongong  
   
 Cloud computing is considered as one of the most prominent paradigms in the information technology industry, since it can significantly reduce the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure. This convenience has enabled corporations to efficiently use cloud storage as a mechanism to share data and cloud computing as a mechanism to outsource computing. One of the most important works in the area of cloud computing is how to provide security protections. The work in the cryptography literature has been very rich in this area, as it has been studied in the past two decades. In this lecture, we will revisit the topics that researchers have been studying. Specifically, we will provide an overview on what research topic that was studied, and currently being studied in the literature. We provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing research based on the published papers spanning from 2007 to 2023. Furthermore, we also discuss the gap between theory and the implementation of the proposed solutions.

 Prof. Sridevan Parameswaran  
 Keynote-1: Day-1, Monday, 2nd December 2024, 9.15 AM- 10.00 AM  
  Topic: Side channel Attacks, Remote Power Attacks and Countermeasures  
  Professor Sridevan Parameswaran, The University of Sydney, Australia  
   
 Deep devastation is felt when privacy is breached, personal information is lost, or property is stolen. Now imagine when all of this happens at once, and the victim is unaware of its occurrence until much later. This is the reality, as an increasing number of electronic devices are used as keys, wallets and files. Security attacks targeting embedded systems illegally gain access to information or destroy information. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used to protect many of these embedded systems. While mathematically shown to be quite secure, it is now well known that AES circuits and software implementations are vulnerable to side channel attacks. Side-channel attacks are performed by observing properties of the system (such as power consumption electromagnetic emission, etc.) while the system performs cryptographic operations. In this talk, differing power-based attacks are described and various countermeasures are explained. A countermeasure titled Algorithmic Balancing is described in detail. Implementation of this countermeasure in hardware and software is described. Since process variation impairs countermeasures we show how this countermeasure can be made to overcome process variations. In the next part of the talk Remote power attacks are described and novel sensors are demonstrated which enable stealthy deployment of attacks on Cloud based FPGAs (such as the Amazon Cloud FPGA).

 Keynote-2: Day-2, Tuesday, 3rd December 2024, 9.00 AM- 9.45 AM  
  Topic: Establishing Trustworthy Data Sharing and Use Frameworks  
  Dr. Ian Oppermann, University of Technology Sydney  
   
 Data is the lifeblood of the modern economy. It impacts, enables and personalises how we work, play and engage socially and is also crucial for the operation of government and the economy. Banks and financial services companies can be described as data and digital services organisations with some bricks and mortar operations. Value comes from creating, using, protecting and sharing data. Use of data is a very wide and vague topic incorporating analysis, storage, aggregation, dissemination and deletion. The value of data is unleashed through sharing. The challenge within any sharing or use relationship is “can I trust the data or data product you have tried to share with me?”. When that data product is a chart or an analytical insight it is easier to apply tests on source of origin, governance and methods of analysis. When the data product is the output of complex AI systems there is little in the way of frameworks to test the image, video, voice message or other generated result. This keynote seeks to outline frameworks which help answer important questions about data and products derived from data: How can I determine if data is fit for the purposes, I plan to use it for? How can I provide guidance / restrictions / prohibitions for future uses of the products I create from this data? How can I enforce restrictions / prohibitions for future uses of the products I create from data? How can I determine if a data product has been manipulated in ways that I did not expect?  
 Brief Bio:  Dr Ian Oppermann is a Digital Economy thought leader, a highly-cited researcher, and a regular speaker about big data, broadband enabled services and the impact of technology on society.

 Dr. Vanessa Teague  
 Keynote-3: Day-2, Tuesday, 3rd December 2024, 9.45 AM- 10.30 AM  
  Topic: Election verification for computer scientists  
  Dr. Vanessa Teague, CEO, Thinking Cybersecurity Pty. Ltd  
   
 In this talk we will discuss some good ideas for election verification and evidence as well as some recent examples of practical failures. We'll discuss the state of election security in Australia and possibly the USA, and think about what technologists can do to improve the situation.  
 Brief Bio:  Dr Vanessa Teague is an Associate Professor (Adjunct.) at the ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics. Dr Teague is a cryptographer living and working on Wurundjeri land in southeastern Australia (near Melbourne). She is interested in cryptographic protocols that support a free and democratic society. She works on openly-available research and open-source software for supporting democratic decision making and empowering ordinary people to make choices about their own data. Dr Teague’s research focuses primarily on cryptographic methods for achieving security and privacy, particularly for issues of public interest such as election integrity and the protection of government data. She was part of the team (with Chris Culnane and Ben Rubinstein) who discovered the easy re-identification of doctors and patients in the Medicare/PBS open dataset released by the Australian Department of Health. Joint work with Andrew Conway has identified several errors in deployed official Australian STV vote counting software, most of which was corrected as a consequence. She has co-designed numerous protocols for improved election integrity in e-voting systems, and co-discovered serious weaknesses in the cryptography of deployed e-voting systems in New South Wales, Western Australia and Switzerland.

 Prof. Willy Susilo  
 Keynote-4: Day-3, Wednesday, 4th December 2024, 9.00 AM- 9.45 AM  
  Topic: Cloud Computing Security: Past, Present and Future  
  Professor Willy Susilo, University of Wollongong  
   
 Cloud computing is considered as one of the most prominent paradigms in the information technology industry, since it can significantly reduce the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure. This convenience has enabled corporations to efficiently use cloud storage as a mechanism to share data and cloud computing as a mechanism to outsource computing. One of the most important works in the area of cloud computing is how to provide security protections. The work in the cryptography literature has been very rich in this area, as it has been studied in the past two decades. In this lecture, we will revisit the topics that researchers have been studying. Specifically, we will provide an overview on what research topic that was studied, and currently being studied in the literature. We provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing research based on the published papers spanning from 2007 to 2023. Furthermore, we also discuss the gap between theory and the implementation of the proposed solutions.

 Abstract:  The relative simplicity and lightweight nature of many IoT devices, and their widespread connectivity via the Internet and other wired and wireless networks, raise issues regarding both their performance and vulnerability. Indeed, their connectivity patterns based on the need to frequently forward and receive data have given rise to the « Massive Access Problem (MAP) of the IoT » which is a form of congestion caused by the IoT’s synchronized and repetitive data transmission patterns. On the other hand, the opportunity that IoT devices present to malicious third parties for generating highly contagious distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Botnet attacks, is also a subject of concern that is widely studied. Thus this presentation will discuss our recent results and research directions that address both of these issues. Regarding the MAP, we will outline the Quasi-Deterministic Transmission Policy (QDTP), and its main theoretical result, and present trace-driven measurements, which show that QDTP can effectively mitigate MAP. We will also show how a Machine Learning approach using novel Auto-Associative Dense Random Neural Networks can detect DDoS attacks with a high degree of accuracy, and discuss the potential of « low cost » online learning to protect IoT gateways and devices against Cyberattacks. The speaker gratefully acknowledges research funding from the EC as part of the H2020 GHOST, SerIoT, and IoTAC projects.

 “Random Neural Networks (RNN) for Accurate CyberAttack Detection and Mitigation at the Edge”  

 Abstract:  Even simple cyberattacks can impair the operation and performance of network systems substantially for many hours and sometimes days, and also increase the system's energy consumption. Their impact on data security, and the effects of the malware that they convey and install, are also well known. Thus there is a widespread need for accurate cyberattack detection, and rapid reaction and mitigation when attacks occur. On the other hand, the detection must avoid false alarms, to avoid impairing the smooth operation of a system which is not under attack. Thus considerable research has been conducted in this important field. Our presentation will briefly introduce the subject, and then focus on some recent results from the last 4-5 years, that are based on the Random Neural Network (RNN). The mathematical model will be described, and its extensions and deep learning algorithms will be discussed in the context of cyberattack detection and mitigation. The presentation will then focus on practical applications illustrated with different cyberattack datasets, showing the high accuracy and low false alarm rates that can be achieved. Measurements of active control schemes for attack mitigation will also be shown. Finally we will also show how the RNN can be used with Reinforcement Learning and SDN (Software Defined Networks), to dynamically control an Edge System that optimizes Security, QoS and Energy Consumption.  
  Note. The talk will be based on our publications in the following journals and conferences: Proceedings of the IEEE (2020), Sensors (2021, 2023), ACM SIGCOMM Flexnets (2021), ICC (2016, 2022), IEEE Access (2022, 2023), Performance Evaluation (2022).

 Abstract:  Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental protocol and backbone of the internet that translates domain names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Initially, it was only meant for mapping domain names, however, currently it is used to transfer data over the internet in the form of plain text. This attracts attackers to perform cyberattacks such as DNS spoofing, DNS amplification, and cache poisoning etc. Various solutions were proposed to protect DNS protocol from such attacks such as using DNS load balancers, OpenDNS by Cisco, DNSFilters etc. However, despite these security measures, the attackers can still easily modify the data packets over the network leading to security and privacy concerns. DNS-Over-HTTPS (DOH) is recently introduced protocol with encrypted DNS that defends against issues related to security and eavesdropping largely. However, some challenges are associated with it that need to be addressed for its proper functioning. In this work, an approach is presented to automatically detect DOH traffic using Ensemble-based machine learning framework. The proposed technique is tested on the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset and evaluated on classification metrics such as precision, recall, f-score, and confusion metrics. Further, to develop a reliable model that can detect anomalies efficiently, a detailed analysis of false positives and false negatives is done. The demonstrated results show that the presented ensembling techniques EL1 and EL2 outperform the existing approaches by achieving an overall accuracy score of 99.5% and 99.7% respectively and F-score of about 99.8% and 99.7% respectively.

 International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP)   
 The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia, computer vision pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that make use of similarity search as a necessary supporting service. From its roots as a regional workshop in metric indexing, SISAP has expanded to become the only international conference entirely devoted to the issues surrounding the theory, design, analysis, practice and application of content-based and feature-based similarity search.  
 The SISAP initiative has also created a repository serving the similarity search community. Source code for similarity indexes as well as experimental test beds and benchmark data sets are made available to all researchers wishing to evaluate and compare new applications, databases, indexes and algorithms for similarity search.

 17th International Conference on  
  Similarity Search and Applications, SISAP 2024  
 The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography biometrics, machine learning, and many others that need similarity searching as a necessary supporting service. Please see the call for papers (to be announced soon) for more details.  
 The SISAP initiative ( www.sisap.org  ) is a forum to exchange real-world, challenging and innovative examples of applications, new indexing techniques, common test-beds and benchmarks, source code and up-to-date literature through its web page, serving the similarity search community. Traditionally, SISAP puts emphasis on the distance-based searching, but in general the conference concerns both the effectiveness and efficiency aspects of any similarity search problem.  
 The series started in 2008 as a workshop and has developed over the years into an international conference with Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (LNCS) proceedings. SISAP is a CORE B conference.  
 A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems  . These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the journal.  
 There will be a Best Paper Award  .  
 SISAP 2024 will take place at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA  .  
 UPDATE APRIL 15th:  SISAP 2024 will follow a double-blind review process, meaning reviewers will not know the names of the authors and the authors will not know the names of their reviewers. Author submission guidelines will be released soon.

 Physics research at GSSI  
 Research in Astroparticle Physics at GSSI covers topics that range from neutrino physics and astrophysics to gravitational waves, from dark matter searches to cosmic ray physics and astrophysics. Below we briefly describe some of the most impressive activities we are involved in.  
  
 Reseach tracks   
 Neutrino Physics: nature, mass, oscillation 
  Dark Matter 
  Nuclear Astrophysics 
  High Energy Astrophysics and Cosmic Rays 
  Gravitational Waves 
  Multi-messenger Astrophysics 
  Physics beyond the Standard Model 
   Underground Physics   
 The research carried out at GSSI in this field exploits the strong synergy with the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), in terms of direct dark matter (DM) search, quantum representation of neutrinos and solar neutrinos. All these activities benefit from the unique low background environment that the LNGS is able to guarantee.  
  The CUORE, CUPID-0 and COSINUS experiments, with their prominent GSSI contribution, pioneered the application of low-temperature calorimeters to both dark matter and other rare events searches. In particular, the CUORE experiment demonstrated that a ton-scale detector based on low-temperature calorimeters can reliably operate at 10 mK. CUORE  is collecting data since 2017, setting one of the most stringent limits to the Majorana neutrino mass, one of the missing pieces in the Neutrino Physics puzzle. To further enhance the potential for discovery, an upgrade of CUORE including particle identification, named CUPID (pilot experiment CUPID-0  , was designed, aiming at a reduction of the background by about two orders of magnitude, thereby making bolometric calorimeters reach the level of radio purity of GERDA, which set the best limit on the half-life of the neutrino-less double beta decay. Low-temperature calorimeters were also chosen by the COSINUS  collaboration to probe the origin of the signal first measured since the ‘90s by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment and claimed to be evidence of DM. GSSI is also involved in the LEGEND  project, the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay search with germanium detectors based on the success of and on the pioneering work of the GERDA experiment.  
  The search for DM has been central to the research activity at GSSI/LNGS. GSSI scientists have the leadership of the DarkSide-20k  project, a direct DM search experiment that started construction and is foreseen to start operation in 2023. The unmatched background rejection provided by Argon, used in the DarkSide program, holds the promise of reaching the strongest potential for discovery of DM particles in the years to come. In the perspective of overcoming the neutrino floor, a severe limitation in the direct search for DM, an intensive effort is being put in place for the directional detection of DM, that aims at isolating the contribution of solar neutrinos, thereby enhancing our capability of detecting truly DM generated events. These efforts are pioneered with CYGNO  , a GSSI-led project aimed at developing high precision TPC for searches of rare events, and partially funded with an ERC (INITIUM).  
  Scientists and students from the GSSI have also been dealing, in the last few years, with the data collected by the Borexino  experiment, aimed at measuring the neutrinos produced by our own Sun. The measurement of the flux of pp neutrinos from the center of the Sun has recently been published in Nature, while the results of the measurement of the flux of neutrinos from the CNO cycle have recently been presented.  
  
  High Energy Astroparticle Physics   
  The high energy astroparticle physics group at GSSI is involved in both experimental and theoretical activities centred around the investigation of the origin of cosmic rays (CRs), gamma rays, ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and high energy phenomena around sources of non-thermal radiations. From the experimental point of view, the GSSI group has reached major achievements both in terms of detection of UHECRs from ground experiments, such as the Pierre AUGER Observatory, and from space, with the Dark Matter Particle Experiment (DAMPE). In both projects, an intensive effort from researchers and students at GSSI is being employed. AUGER  has recently published the first convincing evidence for large scale anisotropy of UHECRs with energy above 8 EeV, strongly suggesting an extragalactic origin for these very high energy particles. The DAMPE  experiment has recently confirmed the existence of a spectral feature in the spectrum of CR protons and extended the measurement to about 100 TeV, where an unexpected flux reduction, of so far unknown origin was found. These results have been recently published in Science Advances. The DAMPE satellite also achieved a remarkable measurement of the spectrum of CR leptons (electrons and positrons), that showed a steepening of the spectrum of these particles at >TeV energies, a long awaited for result in CR physics, published in Nature, with numerous implications for our understanding of CR origin and transport. The GSSI group is also involved in experimental efforts in developing the next generation of CR experiments in space. Much effort is being channelled into the design and construction of a large scale space calorimeter, HERD  , aimed at direct measurements of CR fluxes up to energies in excess of the knee. An intense R&D program is also going to start on a the technological pathfinder mission NUSES  that will test new techniques for space experiments and build prototypes towards different topics: space based UHE neutrinos and CR detectors, low energy CR detection for the study of the lithosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system, study of transient phenomena through the detection of MeV photons.  
  The theoretical activity carried out at GSSI is focused on the investigation of the acceleration and transport of CRs and UHECRs, with special emphasis on the non-linear effects induced by these particles on the environment in which particles move. These investigations are carried out both with semi-analytic techniques and with numerical approaches, often requiring access to high performance computing. These results have been published in high impact journals. Particularly well known is the work done to account for the features in the spectra of primary and secondary CRs and the work done to explain the anomalous positron fraction observed in CRs. The Group has pioneered the idea that CRs have a large impact on the environment in which they propagate, especially around sources, where they give rise to non linear effects with potentially large implications for the pillars that the field is based upon. Several researchers, students and postdocs are involved in this line of research.  
 Gravitation and Cosmology   
  On September 14 2015, the first observation of gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary system of black holes, by the Advanced LIGO detectors, concluded a long scientific quest and opened a new window to observe the universe. On August 17, 2017, the first detection of GWs from a binary system of neutron stars by LIGO  and Virgo  led to the most extensive observational campaign in the history of astronomy. The observation of the source of GW170817 at all electromagnetic wavelengths started the multi-messenger astronomy including GWs with huge impact on fundamental physics, relativistic astrophysics, nuclear physics and cosmology. Scientists at GSSI take important roles in the development and modeling of GW detectors, GW data analyses and observational science combining GW data with data from electromagnetic observatories. The analyses and interpretation of spectra from the European Southern Observatory revealed signatures of r-process nucleosynthesis elements, thereby providing precious information about how heavy elements are formed in the Universe. The GSSI group also took part in the XMM-Newton satellite and the very-long-baseline interferometry observations which demonstrated that the merger of two neutron stars produce a short jetted gamma-ray burst. In a few years, this research has led to tens of articles on high-impact journals, such as Nature, Science, Physical Review Letters, and Astrophysical Journal Letters, leading to international recognition of GSSI’s role in this new field.  
 The current implementation of detector technology at the European Gravitational Observatory  is known as Advanced Virgo+. The GSSI group is responsible for the development of a new sub-system to remove environmental noise from the GW data. This entails the deployment of large sensor arrays in optimal configurations and subsequent optimization of noise-cancellation filters. This system will lead to improved sensitivity of the Virgo detector at low frequencies, significantly improving our parameter estimation of compact-binary coalescences and our chances to observe intermediate-mass black-hole binaries. More broadly, the group is involved in technology developments to improve low-frequency sensitivity, e.g., quantum-non-demolition techniques and novel machine-learning based technologies for active seismic isolation and interferometer control. These activities seamlessly extend to the preparation of next-generation GW detector infrastructures. A proposal was submitted in 2020 to the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) of a new underground infrastructure called Einstein Telescope  hosting future-generations of GW detectors. If approved, the detector is expected to come online around 2035. Scientists at GSSI are strongly involved in the development of a technical design and in the development of the science case of the Einstein Telescope.  
 The GSSI GW group participates in the LISA science team. LISA will be the first space-borne GW detector.  It will observe signals in the millihertz band, which include galactic white-dwarf binaries and massive black-hole binaries. The mission is expected to launch in 2038. Scientists at GSSI also proposed an entirely new detector concept, the Lunar GW Antenna. It foresees the deployment of an array of next-generation seismometers on the Moon to monitor its vibrations caused by passing GWs. The effort currently focuses on the planning of R&D of the science payload and deployment technologies.

 SISAP 2018 – 11 th  International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications  
  The 11 th  International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that make use of similarity search as a necessary supporting service.  
 From its roots as a regional workshop in metric indexing, SISAP has expanded to become the only international conference entirely devoted to the issues surrounding the theory, design, analysis, practice, and application of content-based and feature-based similarity search. The SISAP initiative has also created a repository ( www.sisap.org  ) serving the similarity search community, for the exchange of examples of real-world applications, source code for similarity indexes, and experimental test beds and benchmark data sets.  
 The proceedings of SISAP will be published by Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (LNCS) series. For SISAP 2018, as in previous years, extended versions of 5 selected excellent papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of the journal Information Systems  . The conference will also confer a Best Paper Award, as judged by the Program Committee Co-Chairs and Steering Committee.

 Welcome  
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.  
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages.  
 Software language engineering  (SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasises the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.  
 Like its predecessors, the 18th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2025, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasises the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.  
 SLE 2025 will be co-located with STAF 2025 and take place in Koblenz, Germany.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE)  is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.  
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages.  
 Software language engineering (SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasises the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.  
 Like its predecessors, the 18th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2025, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasises the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.  
 SLE 2025 will be co-located with STAF 2025 and take place in Koblenz, Germany.

  Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance) 
  Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools | User studies evaluating usability 
  Performance benchmarks 
  Industrial applications 
  Synergies between Language Engineering and emerging/promising research areas | Generative AI in language engineering (e.g., AI-based language modelling, AI-driven code generation tools) 
  AI and ML language engineering (e.g., ML compiler testing, code classification) 
  Quantum language engineering (e.g., language design for quantum machines) 
  Language engineering for physical systems (e.g., CPS, IoT, digital twins) 
  Socio-technical systems and language engineering (e.g., language evolution to adapt to social requirements) 
  Types of Submissions   
 SLE accepts the following types of papers:  
 Research papers  : These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to SLE. Papers may range from 6 to 12 pages in length and may optionally include 2 further pages of bibliography/appendices. Papers will be reviewed with an understanding that some results do not need 12 full pages and may be fully described in fewer pages. 
  New ideas/vision papers  : These papers may describe new, unconventional software language engineering research positions or approaches that depart from standard practice. They can describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. They could also provide new evidence to challenge common wisdom, present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that provides novel insight or that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches, or apply SLE technology to radically new application areas. New ideas/vision papers must not exceed 5 pages and may optionally include 1 further page of bibliography/appendices. 
  SLE Body of Knowledge  : The SLE Body of Knowledge (SLEBoK) is a community-wide effort to provide a unique and comprehensive description of the concepts, best practices, tools, and methods developed by the SLE community. In this respect, the SLE conference will accept surveys, essays, open challenges, empirical observations, and case study papers on the SLE topics. These can focus on, but are not limited to, methods, techniques, best practices, and teaching approaches. Papers in this category can have up to 20 pages, including bibliography/appendices. 
  Tool papers  : These papers focus on the tooling aspects often forgotten or neglected in research papers. A good tool paper focuses on practical insights that will likely be useful to other implementers or users in the future. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages and may optionally include 1 further page of bibliography/appendices. They may optionally include an appendix with a demo outline/screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool. 
  Workshops  : Workshops will be organised by STAF. Please inform us and contact STAF 2025 organisers if you would like to organise a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found on the STAF 2025 Website.  
 Submission   
 SLE 2025 has a single submission round for papers, including a mandatory abstract registration and a rebuttal phase, where all authors of research papers will have the possibility of responding to the reviews on their submissions.  
 Authors of accepted research papers will be invited to submit artefacts.  
 Format   
 Submissions have to use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  ; please make sure that you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template, and that the document class definition is \documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}  . Do not make any changes to this format!  
 Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colours remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible.  
 To increase fairness in reviewing, a double-blind review process has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences. Accordingly, SLE will follow the double-blind process. Author names and institutions must be omitted from submitted papers, and references to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer their identities in implicit ways.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format. The submission website is: https://sle25.hotcrp.com   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.  
 Policy on Human Participant and Subject Research   
 Authors conducting research involving human participants and subjects must ensure that their research complies with their local governing laws and regulations and the ACM’s general principles, as stated in the ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . If submissions are found to be violating this policy, they will be rejected.  
 Reviewing Process   
 All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning soundness, relevance, novelty, presentation, and replicability. New ideas/vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning soundness, relevance, novelty, and presentation.

  The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.  
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages.  
 Software language engineering  (SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.  
 Like its predecessors, the 11th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2018, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasizes the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.  
 SLE 2018 is to be held on November 5th and 6th 2018, co-located with SPLASH  and GPCE  in Boston, USA.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Topics of Interest   
 SLE 2018 solicits high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of software language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in contributions from the following areas:  
 Software Language Design and Implementation | Approaches to and methods for language design 
  Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints) 
  Techniques for specifying behavioral / executable semantics 
  Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation) 
  Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches 
  Software Language Validation | Verification and formal methods for languages 
  Testing techniques for languages 
  Simulation techniques for languages 
  Software Language Integration and Composition | Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools 
  Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages) 
  Traceability between languages 
  Deployment of languages to different platforms 
  Software Language Maintenance | Software language reuse 
  Language evolution 
  Language families and variability 
  Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance) 
  Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools | User studies evaluating usability 
  Performance benchmarks 
  Industrial applications 
  Types of Submissions   
 Research papers:  These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Tool papers:  Because of SLE’s interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages excluding bibliography, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission. 
  New ideas / vision papers:  New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE research approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Workshops:  Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found at the SPLASH 2018 Website  .  
 Artifact Evaluation   
 For the third year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, please have a look at the Artifact Evaluation  page.  
 Submission   
 Format   
 Submissions have to use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  ; please make sure that you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template  , and that the document class definition is \documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}  . Do not make any changes to this format!  
 Using the Word template is strongly discouraged.  
 Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible.  
 SLE follows a single-blind review process. Thus, you do not have to blind your submission.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Site   
 Submissions will be accepted at https://sle18.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Reviewing Process   
 All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call. New ideas / vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning novelty, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call.  
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the PC chairs.  
 Awards   
 Distinguished paper: | Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee. 
  Distinguished reviewer: | Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs. 
  Distinguished artifact: | Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 SLE will, for the third year, use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of artifacts on which papers are based. The aim of this evaluation process is to foster a culture of experimental reproducibility and to provide a peer review process for artifacts as well as papers.  
 Authors of papers accepted for SLE 2018 will be invited to submit artifacts. Any kind of artifact that is presented in the paper, supplements the paper with further details, or underlies the paper can be submitted. This includes, for instance; tools, grammars, metamodels, models, programs, algorithms, scripts, proofs, datasets, statistical tests, checklists, surveys, interview scripts, visualizations, annotated bibliographies, and tutorials.  
 The submitted artifacts will be reviewed by a dedicated Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). Artifacts that live up to the expectations created by the paper will receive a badge of approval from the AEC. The approved artifacts will be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. This will ensure the permanent and durable storage of the artifacts alongside the published papers fostering the repeatability of experiments, enabling precise comparison with alternative approaches, and helping the dissemination of the author’s ideas in detail.  
 The AEC will award the artifact that most significantly exceeds the expectations with a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Participating in the artifact evaluation and publishing approved artifacts in the ACM Digital Library is voluntary. However, we strongly encourage authors to consider this possibility as the availability of artifacts will greatly benefit readers of papers and increase the impact of the work. Note that the artifact evaluation cannot affect the acceptance of the paper, because it only happens after the decision about acceptance has been made.  
 The artifact evaluation process of SLE borrows heavily from processes described at artifact-eval.org  and from previous experience in SLE, ECOOP, and ICSCME. The process is detailed in the below.  
 Submission   
 If and when your paper has been accepted for SLE 2018, you will be invited by the AEC chairs to submit the artifacts related to your work. This invitation will contain detailed instructions on how to submit your artifacts.  
 An artifact submission comprises the following components:  
 Paper: Preliminary PDF version of the accepted SLE 2018 paper. The paper will be used to evaluate the consistency of the accepted paper and the submitted artifact, as well as to assess whether the artifact lives up to the expectations created by the paper. 
  Authors of the artifact: This list may include people who are not authors of the accepted paper, but contributed to creating the artifact. 
  Abstract: A short description of the artifact to be used for assignments of artifacts to AEC members. 
  Artifact: An archive file ( | gz | , | xz | , or | zip | ) containing everything needed for supporting a full evaluation of the artifact. The archive file has to include at least the artifact itself and a text file | README.txt | that contains the following information: | An overview of the archive file documenting the content of the archive. 
  A setup / installation guide giving detailed instructions on how to setup or install the submitted artifact. 
  Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions given in the paper. 
  If multiple artifacts relate to an accepted SLE paper, all artifacts should be collected in one archive and submitted together in one single submission. For instance, if a tool has been developed, a tutorial has been authored with detailed instructions on how to use the tool, and user studies have been performed for evaluating the tool’s properties, the tool, the tutorial, and the raw data collected in the user study should be packed in one archive file and submitted together in one single submission to the SLE 2018 artifact evaluation.  
 When preparing your artifact, consider that your artifact should be as accessible to the AEC as possible. In particular, it should be possible for the AEC to quickly make progress in the investigation of your artifact. Please provide some simple scenarios describing concretely how the artifact is intended to be used. For a tool, this would include specific inputs to provide or actions to take, and expected output or behavior in response to this input.  
 For artifacts that are tools, it is recommended to provide the tool installed and ready to use on a virtual machine for VirtualBox, VMware, SHARE, a Docker image, or a similar widely available platform.  
 Please use widely supported open formats for documents (e.g., PDF, HTML) and data (e.g., CSV, JSON).  
 Evaluation Process   
 Submitted artifacts will be evaluated by the AEC concerning the following criteria. Artifacts should be:  
 consistent with the paper, 
  as complete as possible, 
  well documented, and 
  easy to (re)use, facilitating further research. 
  Each submitted artifact will be evaluated by at least two members of the AEC. Thereby, the artifacts will be treated confidentially, as with the submitted paper.  
 Artifacts that pass the evaluation will receive an “Artifact Evaluated - Functional” badge and be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. Artifacts that will be included in the ACM Digital Library or that will be made permanently available in another publicly accessible archival repository will also receive the “Artifact Available” badge. Detailed definitions of these badges and the respective evaluation criteria may be found at the ACM Artifact Review Badging site.  
 The evaluation consists of two steps:  
 Kicking-the-tires: Reviewers will check the artifact’s integrity and look for any possible setup problems that may prevent it from being properly evaluated (e.g., corrupted or missing files, VM won’t start, immediate crashes on the simplest example, etc.). In case of any problems, authors will be given a 48-hour period (September 14-15) to read and respond to the kick-the-tires reports of their artifacts and solve any issues preventing the artifact evaluation. 
  Artifact assessment: Reviewers evaluate the artifacts and decide on the approval of the artifact. 
  Notification about the outcome of the artifact evaluation and reviews including suggestions for improving the artifacts will be distributed about one week before the deadline for the final version of the research paper, such that the outcome can be mentioned in the paper and the final artifact can be uploaded for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library.

  Call for Papers 
  The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.  
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages.  
 Software language engineering  (SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.  
 Like its predecessors, the 11th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2018, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasizes the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.  
 SLE 2018 is to be held on November 5th and 6th 2018, co-located with SPLASH  and GPCE  in Boston, USA.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Topics of Interest   
 SLE 2018 solicits high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of software language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in contributions from the following areas:  
 Software Language Design and Implementation | Approaches to and methods for language design 
  Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints) 
  Techniques for specifying behavioral / executable semantics 
  Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation) 
  Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches 
  Software Language Validation | Verification and formal methods for languages 
  Testing techniques for languages 
  Simulation techniques for languages 
  Software Language Integration and Composition | Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools 
  Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages) 
  Traceability between languages 
  Deployment of languages to different platforms 
  Software Language Maintenance | Software language reuse 
  Language evolution 
  Language families and variability 
  Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance) 
  Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools | User studies evaluating usability 
  Performance benchmarks 
  Industrial applications 
  Types of Submissions   
 Research papers:  These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Tool papers:  Because of SLE’s interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages excluding bibliography, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission. 
  New ideas / vision papers:  New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE research approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Workshops:  Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found at the SPLASH 2018 Website  .  
 Artifact Evaluation   
 For the third year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, please have a look at the Artifact Evaluation  page.  
 Submission   
 Format   
 Submissions have to use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  ; please make sure that you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template  , and that the document class definition is \documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}  . Do not make any changes to this format!  
 Using the Word template is strongly discouraged.  
 Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible.  
 SLE follows a single-blind review process. Thus, you do not have to blind your submission.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Site   
 Submissions will be accepted at https://sle18.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Reviewing Process   
 All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call. New ideas / vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning novelty, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call.  
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the PC chairs.  
 Awards   
 Distinguished paper: | Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee. 
  Distinguished reviewer: | Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs. 
  Distinguished artifact: | Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, please contact the organizers by email: sle2018@googlegroups.com  .  

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 SLE will, for the third year, use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of artifacts on which papers are based. The aim of this evaluation process is to foster a culture of experimental reproducibility and to provide a peer review process for artifacts as well as papers.  
 Authors of papers accepted for SLE 2018 will be invited to submit artifacts. Any kind of artifact that is presented in the paper, supplements the paper with further details, or underlies the paper can be submitted. This includes, for instance; tools, grammars, metamodels, models, programs, algorithms, scripts, proofs, datasets, statistical tests, checklists, surveys, interview scripts, visualizations, annotated bibliographies, and tutorials.  
 The submitted artifacts will be reviewed by a dedicated Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). Artifacts that live up to the expectations created by the paper will receive a badge of approval from the AEC. The approved artifacts will be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. This will ensure the permanent and durable storage of the artifacts alongside the published papers fostering the repeatability of experiments, enabling precise comparison with alternative approaches, and helping the dissemination of the author’s ideas in detail.  
 The AEC will award the artifact that most significantly exceeds the expectations with a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Participating in the artifact evaluation and publishing approved artifacts in the ACM Digital Library is voluntary. However, we strongly encourage authors to consider this possibility as the availability of artifacts will greatly benefit readers of papers and increase the impact of the work. Note that the artifact evaluation cannot affect the acceptance of the paper, because it only happens after the decision about acceptance has been made.  
 The artifact evaluation process of SLE borrows heavily from processes described at artifact-eval.org  and from previous experience in SLE, ECOOP, and ICSCME. The process is detailed in the below.  
 Submission   
 If and when your paper has been accepted for SLE 2018, you will be invited by the AEC chairs to submit the artifacts related to your work. This invitation will contain detailed instructions on how to submit your artifacts.  
 An artifact submission comprises the following components:  
 Paper: Preliminary PDF version of the accepted SLE 2018 paper. The paper will be used to evaluate the consistency of the accepted paper and the submitted artifact, as well as to assess whether the artifact lives up to the expectations created by the paper. 
  Authors of the artifact: This list may include people who are not authors of the accepted paper, but contributed to creating the artifact. 
  Abstract: A short description of the artifact to be used for assignments of artifacts to AEC members. 
  Artifact: An archive file ( | gz | , | xz | , or | zip | ) containing everything needed for supporting a full evaluation of the artifact. The archive file has to include at least the artifact itself and a text file | README.txt | that contains the following information: | An overview of the archive file documenting the content of the archive. 
  A setup / installation guide giving detailed instructions on how to setup or install the submitted artifact. 
  Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions given in the paper. 
  If multiple artifacts relate to an accepted SLE paper, all artifacts should be collected in one archive and submitted together in one single submission. For instance, if a tool has been developed, a tutorial has been authored with detailed instructions on how to use the tool, and user studies have been performed for evaluating the tool’s properties, the tool, the tutorial, and the raw data collected in the user study should be packed in one archive file and submitted together in one single submission to the SLE 2018 artifact evaluation.  
 When preparing your artifact, consider that your artifact should be as accessible to the AEC as possible. In particular, it should be possible for the AEC to quickly make progress in the investigation of your artifact. Please provide some simple scenarios describing concretely how the artifact is intended to be used. For a tool, this would include specific inputs to provide or actions to take, and expected output or behavior in response to this input.  
 For artifacts that are tools, it is recommended to provide the tool installed and ready to use on a virtual machine for VirtualBox, VMware, SHARE, a Docker image, or a similar widely available platform.  
 Please use widely supported open formats for documents (e.g., PDF, HTML) and data (e.g., CSV, JSON).  
 Evaluation Process   
 Submitted artifacts will be evaluated by the AEC concerning the following criteria. Artifacts should be:  
 consistent with the paper, 
  as complete as possible, 
  well documented, and 
  easy to (re)use, facilitating further research. 
  Each submitted artifact will be evaluated by at least two members of the AEC. Thereby, the artifacts will be treated confidentially, as with the submitted paper.  
 Artifacts that pass the evaluation will receive an “Artifact Evaluated - Functional” badge and be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. Artifacts that will be included in the ACM Digital Library or that will be made permanently available in another publicly accessible archival repository will also receive the “Artifact Available” badge. Detailed definitions of these badges and the respective evaluation criteria may be found at the ACM Artifact Review Badging site.  
 The evaluation consists of two steps:  
 Kicking-the-tires: Reviewers will check the artifact’s integrity and look for any possible setup problems that may prevent it from being properly evaluated (e.g., corrupted or missing files, VM won’t start, immediate crashes on the simplest example, etc.). In case of any problems, authors will be given a 48-hour period (September 14-15) to read and respond to the kick-the-tires reports of their artifacts and solve any issues preventing the artifact evaluation. 
  Artifact assessment: Reviewers evaluate the artifacts and decide on the approval of the artifact. 
  Notification about the outcome of the artifact evaluation and reviews including suggestions for improving the artifacts will be distributed about one week before the deadline for the final version of the research paper, such that the outcome can be mentioned in the paper and the final artifact can be uploaded for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library.

  The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.  
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages.  
 Software language engineering  (SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.  
 Like its predecessors, the 11th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2018, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasizes the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.  
 SLE 2018 is to be held on November 5th and 6th 2018, co-located with SPLASH  and GPCE  in Boston, USA.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Topics of Interest   
 SLE 2018 solicits high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of software language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in contributions from the following areas:  
 Software Language Design and Implementation | Approaches to and methods for language design 
  Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints) 
  Techniques for specifying behavioral / executable semantics 
  Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation) 
  Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches 
  Software Language Validation | Verification and formal methods for languages 
  Testing techniques for languages 
  Simulation techniques for languages 
  Software Language Integration and Composition | Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools 
  Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages) 
  Traceability between languages 
  Deployment of languages to different platforms 
  Software Language Maintenance | Software language reuse 
  Language evolution 
  Language families and variability 
  Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance) 
  Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools | User studies evaluating usability 
  Performance benchmarks 
  Industrial applications 
  Types of Submissions   
 Research papers:  These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Tool papers:  Because of SLE’s interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages excluding bibliography, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission. 
  New ideas / vision papers:  New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE research approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Workshops:  Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found at the SPLASH 2018 Website  .  
 Artifact Evaluation   
 For the third year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, please have a look at the Artifact Evaluation  page.  
 Submission   
 Format   
 Submissions have to use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  ; please make sure that you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template  , and that the document class definition is \documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}  . Do not make any changes to this format!  
 Using the Word template is strongly discouraged.  
 Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible.  
 SLE follows a single-blind review process. Thus, you do not have to blind your submission.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Site   
 Submissions will be accepted at https://sle18.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Reviewing Process   
 All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call. New ideas / vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning novelty, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call.  
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the PC chairs.  
 Awards   
 Distinguished paper: | Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee. 
  Distinguished reviewer: | Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs. 
  Distinguished artifact: | Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 SLE will, for the third year, use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of artifacts on which papers are based. The aim of this evaluation process is to foster a culture of experimental reproducibility and to provide a peer review process for artifacts as well as papers.  
 Authors of papers accepted for SLE 2018 will be invited to submit artifacts. Any kind of artifact that is presented in the paper, supplements the paper with further details, or underlies the paper can be submitted. This includes, for instance; tools, grammars, metamodels, models, programs, algorithms, scripts, proofs, datasets, statistical tests, checklists, surveys, interview scripts, visualizations, annotated bibliographies, and tutorials.  
 The submitted artifacts will be reviewed by a dedicated Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). Artifacts that live up to the expectations created by the paper will receive a badge of approval from the AEC. The approved artifacts will be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. This will ensure the permanent and durable storage of the artifacts alongside the published papers fostering the repeatability of experiments, enabling precise comparison with alternative approaches, and helping the dissemination of the author’s ideas in detail.  
 The AEC will award the artifact that most significantly exceeds the expectations with a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Participating in the artifact evaluation and publishing approved artifacts in the ACM Digital Library is voluntary. However, we strongly encourage authors to consider this possibility as the availability of artifacts will greatly benefit readers of papers and increase the impact of the work. Note that the artifact evaluation cannot affect the acceptance of the paper, because it only happens after the decision about acceptance has been made.  
 The artifact evaluation process of SLE borrows heavily from processes described at artifact-eval.org  and from previous experience in SLE, ECOOP, and ICSCME. The process is detailed in the below.  
 Submission   
 If and when your paper has been accepted for SLE 2018, you will be invited by the AEC chairs to submit the artifacts related to your work. This invitation will contain detailed instructions on how to submit your artifacts.  
 An artifact submission comprises the following components:  
 Paper: Preliminary PDF version of the accepted SLE 2018 paper. The paper will be used to evaluate the consistency of the accepted paper and the submitted artifact, as well as to assess whether the artifact lives up to the expectations created by the paper. 
  Authors of the artifact: This list may include people who are not authors of the accepted paper, but contributed to creating the artifact. 
  Abstract: A short description of the artifact to be used for assignments of artifacts to AEC members. 
  Artifact: An archive file ( | gz | , | xz | , or | zip | ) containing everything needed for supporting a full evaluation of the artifact. The archive file has to include at least the artifact itself and a text file | README.txt | that contains the following information: | An overview of the archive file documenting the content of the archive. 
  A setup / installation guide giving detailed instructions on how to setup or install the submitted artifact. 
  Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions given in the paper. 
  If multiple artifacts relate to an accepted SLE paper, all artifacts should be collected in one archive and submitted together in one single submission. For instance, if a tool has been developed, a tutorial has been authored with detailed instructions on how to use the tool, and user studies have been performed for evaluating the tool’s properties, the tool, the tutorial, and the raw data collected in the user study should be packed in one archive file and submitted together in one single submission to the SLE 2018 artifact evaluation.  
 When preparing your artifact, consider that your artifact should be as accessible to the AEC as possible. In particular, it should be possible for the AEC to quickly make progress in the investigation of your artifact. Please provide some simple scenarios describing concretely how the artifact is intended to be used. For a tool, this would include specific inputs to provide or actions to take, and expected output or behavior in response to this input.  
 For artifacts that are tools, it is recommended to provide the tool installed and ready to use on a virtual machine for VirtualBox, VMware, SHARE, a Docker image, or a similar widely available platform.  
 Please use widely supported open formats for documents (e.g., PDF, HTML) and data (e.g., CSV, JSON).  
 Evaluation Process   
 Submitted artifacts will be evaluated by the AEC concerning the following criteria. Artifacts should be:  
 consistent with the paper, 
  as complete as possible, 
  well documented, and 
  easy to (re)use, facilitating further research. 
  Each submitted artifact will be evaluated by at least two members of the AEC. Thereby, the artifacts will be treated confidentially, as with the submitted paper.  
 Artifacts that pass the evaluation will receive an “Artifact Evaluated - Functional” badge and be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. Artifacts that will be included in the ACM Digital Library or that will be made permanently available in another publicly accessible archival repository will also receive the “Artifact Available” badge. Detailed definitions of these badges and the respective evaluation criteria may be found at the ACM Artifact Review Badging site.  
 The evaluation consists of two steps:  
 Kicking-the-tires: Reviewers will check the artifact’s integrity and look for any possible setup problems that may prevent it from being properly evaluated (e.g., corrupted or missing files, VM won’t start, immediate crashes on the simplest example, etc.). In case of any problems, authors will be given a 48-hour period (September 14-15) to read and respond to the kick-the-tires reports of their artifacts and solve any issues preventing the artifact evaluation. 
  Artifact assessment: Reviewers evaluate the artifacts and decide on the approval of the artifact. 
  Notification about the outcome of the artifact evaluation and reviews including suggestions for improving the artifacts will be distributed about one week before the deadline for the final version of the research paper, such that the outcome can be mentioned in the paper and the final artifact can be uploaded for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library.

  The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.  
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages.  
 Software language engineering  (SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.  
 Like its predecessors, the 11th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2018, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasizes the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.  
 SLE 2018 is to be held on November 5th and 6th 2018, co-located with SPLASH  and GPCE  in Boston, USA.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Topics of Interest   
 SLE 2018 solicits high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of software language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in contributions from the following areas:  
 Software Language Design and Implementation | Approaches to and methods for language design 
  Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints) 
  Techniques for specifying behavioral / executable semantics 
  Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation) 
  Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches 
  Software Language Validation | Verification and formal methods for languages 
  Testing techniques for languages 
  Simulation techniques for languages 
  Software Language Integration and Composition | Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools 
  Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages) 
  Traceability between languages 
  Deployment of languages to different platforms 
  Software Language Maintenance | Software language reuse 
  Language evolution 
  Language families and variability 
  Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance) 
  Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools | User studies evaluating usability 
  Performance benchmarks 
  Industrial applications 
  Types of Submissions   
 Research papers:  These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Tool papers:  Because of SLE’s interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages excluding bibliography, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission. 
  New ideas / vision papers:  New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE research approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages excluding bibliography. 
  Workshops:  Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found at the SPLASH 2018 Website  .  
 Artifact Evaluation   
 For the third year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, please have a look at the Artifact Evaluation  page.  
 Submission   
 Format   
 Submissions have to use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  ; please make sure that you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template  , and that the document class definition is \documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}  . Do not make any changes to this format!  
 Using the Word template is strongly discouraged.  
 Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible.  
 SLE follows a single-blind review process. Thus, you do not have to blind your submission.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Site   
 Submissions will be accepted at https://sle18.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Reviewing Process   
 All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call. New ideas / vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning novelty, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call.  
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the PC chairs.  
 Awards   
 Distinguished paper: | Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee. 
  Distinguished reviewer: | Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs. 
  Distinguished artifact: | Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Contact   
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, please contact the organizers by email: sle2018@googlegroups.com  .  

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 SLE will, for the third year, use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of artifacts on which papers are based. The aim of this evaluation process is to foster a culture of experimental reproducibility and to provide a peer review process for artifacts as well as papers.  
 Authors of papers accepted for SLE 2018 will be invited to submit artifacts. Any kind of artifact that is presented in the paper, supplements the paper with further details, or underlies the paper can be submitted. This includes, for instance; tools, grammars, metamodels, models, programs, algorithms, scripts, proofs, datasets, statistical tests, checklists, surveys, interview scripts, visualizations, annotated bibliographies, and tutorials.  
 The submitted artifacts will be reviewed by a dedicated Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). Artifacts that live up to the expectations created by the paper will receive a badge of approval from the AEC. The approved artifacts will be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. This will ensure the permanent and durable storage of the artifacts alongside the published papers fostering the repeatability of experiments, enabling precise comparison with alternative approaches, and helping the dissemination of the author’s ideas in detail.  
 The AEC will award the artifact that most significantly exceeds the expectations with a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Participating in the artifact evaluation and publishing approved artifacts in the ACM Digital Library is voluntary. However, we strongly encourage authors to consider this possibility as the availability of artifacts will greatly benefit readers of papers and increase the impact of the work. Note that the artifact evaluation cannot affect the acceptance of the paper, because it only happens after the decision about acceptance has been made.  
 The artifact evaluation process of SLE borrows heavily from processes described at artifact-eval.org  and from previous experience in SLE, ECOOP, and ICSCME. The process is detailed in the below.  
 Submission   
 If and when your paper has been accepted for SLE 2018, you will be invited by the AEC chairs to submit the artifacts related to your work. This invitation will contain detailed instructions on how to submit your artifacts.  
 An artifact submission comprises the following components:  
 Paper: Preliminary PDF version of the accepted SLE 2018 paper. The paper will be used to evaluate the consistency of the accepted paper and the submitted artifact, as well as to assess whether the artifact lives up to the expectations created by the paper. 
  Authors of the artifact: This list may include people who are not authors of the accepted paper, but contributed to creating the artifact. 
  Abstract: A short description of the artifact to be used for assignments of artifacts to AEC members. 
  Artifact: An archive file ( | gz | , | xz | , or | zip | ) containing everything needed for supporting a full evaluation of the artifact. The archive file has to include at least the artifact itself and a text file | README.txt | that contains the following information: | An overview of the archive file documenting the content of the archive. 
  A setup / installation guide giving detailed instructions on how to setup or install the submitted artifact. 
  Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions given in the paper. 
  If multiple artifacts relate to an accepted SLE paper, all artifacts should be collected in one archive and submitted together in one single submission. For instance, if a tool has been developed, a tutorial has been authored with detailed instructions on how to use the tool, and user studies have been performed for evaluating the tool’s properties, the tool, the tutorial, and the raw data collected in the user study should be packed in one archive file and submitted together in one single submission to the SLE 2018 artifact evaluation.  
 When preparing your artifact, consider that your artifact should be as accessible to the AEC as possible. In particular, it should be possible for the AEC to quickly make progress in the investigation of your artifact. Please provide some simple scenarios describing concretely how the artifact is intended to be used. For a tool, this would include specific inputs to provide or actions to take, and expected output or behavior in response to this input.  
 For artifacts that are tools, it is recommended to provide the tool installed and ready to use on a virtual machine for VirtualBox, VMware, SHARE, a Docker image, or a similar widely available platform.  
 Please use widely supported open formats for documents (e.g., PDF, HTML) and data (e.g., CSV, JSON).  
 Evaluation Process   
 Submitted artifacts will be evaluated by the AEC concerning the following criteria. Artifacts should be:  
 consistent with the paper, 
  as complete as possible, 
  well documented, and 
  easy to (re)use, facilitating further research. 
  Each submitted artifact will be evaluated by at least two members of the AEC. Thereby, the artifacts will be treated confidentially, as with the submitted paper.  
 Artifacts that pass the evaluation will receive an “Artifact Evaluated - Functional” badge and be invited for inclusion in the electronic conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. Artifacts that will be included in the ACM Digital Library or that will be made permanently available in another publicly accessible archival repository will also receive the “Artifact Available” badge. Detailed definitions of these badges and the respective evaluation criteria may be found at the ACM Artifact Review Badging site.  
 The evaluation consists of two steps:  
 Kicking-the-tires: Reviewers will check the artifact’s integrity and look for any possible setup problems that may prevent it from being properly evaluated (e.g., corrupted or missing files, VM won’t start, immediate crashes on the simplest example, etc.). In case of any problems, authors will be given a 48-hour period (September 14-15) to read and respond to the kick-the-tires reports of their artifacts and solve any issues preventing the artifact evaluation. 
  Artifact assessment: Reviewers evaluate the artifacts and decide on the approval of the artifact. 
  Notification about the outcome of the artifact evaluation and reviews including suggestions for improving the artifacts will be distributed about one week before the deadline for the final version of the research paper, such that the outcome can be mentioned in the paper and the final artifact can be uploaded for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library.

 Overview  
 The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. It provides an international forum for researchers, educators, and practitioners to learn, share knowledge, report most recent innovations and developments, and exchange ideas and advances in all aspects of systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and cybernetics. The theme of the IEEE SMC 2025 conference is “Navigating Frontiers: Smart Systems for a Dynamic World”.  

 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors must adhere to the IEEE conference written paper format (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) and they must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadlines (see dates below). These are submitted through the PaperCept submission system (see link above). IEEE is very strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.  We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word  and LaTeX  format provided by IEEE. A4 page size should be used. Please use them to create your paper, but don’t modify the style or the format under any circumstances.  
 Submit only original work, not previously published or copyrighted. Prospective authors are expected to submit only their original works. The conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to help verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE’s publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, then disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. For further details please have a look at the Conference Authors @ IEEE Author Center.   
 Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings, which will be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library  , once it meets the requirements of an IEEE quality review.  
 For paper or abstract submission, please use the template provided by the PaperCept system: https://conf.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl

 SJR   

 The SJR is a size-independent prestige indicator that ranks journals by their 'average prestige per article'. It is based on the idea that 'all citations are not created equal'. SJR is a measure of scientific influence of journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from It measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is.

 Code of conduct   
 SoCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants. Starting in 2025, CG Week including SoCG will be organized as an event of the CG Society  . All members of the Society are bound by its Code of Conduct  . Only members of the Society can give a presentation and hence at least one author of each accepted paper must become a member of the Society. Society membership is free.  

 Submission Guidelines   
 Paper types | When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission. | Mathematical Foundations: | A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm development. 
  Algorithmic Complexity: | A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the proposed new methods and techniques. 
  Experiments and Implementation: | A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluationp of geometric algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained. 
  Applications: | A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry tools to the specific area. 
  Double Blind and PC submissions | SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, funding information, and email addresses should not appear in the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). Particular care needs to be taken if there is any accompanying software or data, which needs to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox anonymous folder or Anonymous GitHub  , perhaps with a subset of synthetic data if the real data is not anonymized). Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest with PC members, as well as listing email address or domain level conflicts (i.e. “Haitao Wang (University of Utah)”, “All (Graz University of Technology)”) of other professional or personal conflicts. This includes past advisors and students, people with the same affiliation, and any recent/frequent coauthors and collaborators. Please refer to the SoCG 2025 Conflict of Interest Guidelines  for a detailed discussion of possible conflicts of interest. | The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs, or to see the more detailed discussion in the proposal  that preceded the vote to move to double blind. 
  Format | Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines  . Authors are required to use the LaTeX class file socg-lipics-v2021.cls  (V0.9, Sep 19, 2022), with the option “anonymous”; note that the class file is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class. The LIPIcs style and instructions are available here  ; the SoCG class file is available here  , and instructions on how to use it are available here  . Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further described below), but including all other lines (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.). The class files provide line counting which should be accurate in most cases. Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of text in parts in which lines are not counted automatically. If authors need constructs that contain uncounted lines of text, they should compensate for this by reducing the final line count accordingly. It is the sole responsibility of the authors not to exceed 500 lines even if some lines are not counted automatically. 
  Contents of the submission | Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. | In addition, authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. For instance, if the number of authors is large, consider writing "The authors in [#] show" instead of "A et al. [#] show". 
  Appendix and additional data | All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix. If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors of all types of papers are encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, if there is any, in a repository accessible to the reviewers. 
  Previous or simultaneous submissions | Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with handouts containing short abstracts. In particular, submissions of papers that have appeared or will be submitted to EuroCG are allowed, since EuroCG does not publish formal proceedings, while submissions of papers that have appeared in CCCG are not allowed. Results that have already been accepted (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their submission to the symposium are not allowed. 
  Strict guidelines | Submissions deviating from the above guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration. 
  Guidelines for reviewers | The guidelines for reviewers are available here  . 

 Accepted Papers   
 Presentation | An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes). Note that SoCG 2025 will be organized as an event of the CG Society  and hence the presenting author(s) must be a member of the Society. Society membership is free. 
  Best paper award | An accepted paper may be selected as the best paper. All papers are eligible. | Best student paper award | An accepted paper may be selected as the best student paper. A paper is eligible if all authors are students at the time of submission. This must be indicated in the submission process. There is a box provided for this purpose on the submission server. | Best student presentation award | Based on the feedback from the audience, a presentation during the symposium by a student may be selected as the best student presentation. | In exceptional cases, each of these awards may be granted to more than one paper/presentation. 
  Invited papers and special issues | Authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to the Journal of the ACM  , and authors of one (or more) most highly ranked papers may be invited to submit their full paper to the journal TheoretiCS  . Authors of a selection of accepted papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of Discrete & Computational Geometry  and Journal of Computational Geometry  . 
  Format | Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must respect the same formatting constraints as the submissions ( LIPIcs proceedings format  with socg-lipics-v2021  ; 500-line limit, excluding front matter and references), but must not comprise any appendix. If any supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the conference version and made available at a public repository, such as arXiv  , by the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with proper references in the paper.

 Service-oriented computing is considered today a key technology for the development of robust and high quality intelligent distributed and embedded applications. Extensive research and development in the past few years has pushed SOA technology into state-of-the-art application areas such as context-aware, cloud-connected, mobile enterprise systems. However, many of the critical components on building reliable, robust, and user-centric sensor-based SOA systems are still open for research. Hence, it is timely to reexamine SOA research opportunities and identify new research challenges for next generation SOA.  
 One of the future SOA applications is large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that include deep interactions between cyber-sides and physical-sides through massive sensors, actuators, mobile devices, and computing servers connected by heterogeneous networks. The services of large-scale CPSs have challenging requirements such as accurate timeliness, high reliability, and dynamic adaptability. Many of the service components are deployed on resource limited embedded systems and are performance sensitive; others are deployed on cloud servers providing highly parallel services. Thus, SOA may provide effective solutions for managing the ever-increasing complexity while meeting the challenging requirements of CPS services on largely distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic resource environments.  
 The 2013 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA 2013) will be held in Kauai, Hawaii, with topics of general service oriented computing and also the focused area of SOA for large-scale CPSs. The conference includes three days of parallel tracks program, special-topic workshops/ tutorials, and panel discussion. We invite submissions of high quality papers describing fully developed results or ongoing work on the topics such as:  
   
 Service-oriented architecture, engineering, and applications 
  Large-scale cyber-physical systems 
  Intelligent service composition, management and maintenance 
  Configurable and reconfigurable service middleware 
  Dependable and trustworthy services 
  Streaming and real-time data analytics 
  Mobile service engineering and applications 
  Security and privacy for intelligent service applications 
  Context-aware connected embedded computing 
  Service composition with multi-dimensional QoS 
  Service networks for smart home, smart transportation, and smart infrastructure 
  Sustainability issues on large-scale CPS applications 
   
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will be limited to 8 (IEEE style) pages. Please follow the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines to prepare your papers with 8.5'' x 11'', two-column format. The paper formatting instructions are available at http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF) is required through the paper submission system in the SOCA 2013 homepage http://conferences.computer.org/soca. All papers submitted to SOCA 2013 will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. Papers that are selected for presentation at SOCA 2013 will appear in the Proceedings of SOCA 2013 and be included in IEEE Xplore and indexed by EI. Each paper accepted for SOCA 2013 requires at least one author to register at the full rate (IEEE member or non-IEEE member). At least one author is required to attend the conference and present the paper. The best papers from the proceedings will be selected for publication in the Springer Journal on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA) as well as special issues in international journals to be announced. Furthermore, a Best Paper Award will be presented to the best paper selected from the accepted full papers. | Call for Papers | A pdf version of Call for Papers can be downloaded here

The services of large-scale CPSs have challenging requirements such as accurate timeliness, high reliability, and dynamic adaptability. Many of the service components are deployed on resource limited embedded systems and are performance sensitive; others are deployed on cloud servers providing highly parallel services. Thus, SOA may provide effective solutions for managing the ever-increasing complexity while meeting the challenging requirements of CPS services on largely distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic resource environments.  
 The 2013 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA 2013) will be held in Kauai, Hawaii, with topics of general service oriented computing and also the focused area of SOA for large-scale CPSs. The conference includes three days of parallel tracks program, special-topic workshops/ tutorials, and panel discussion. We invite submissions of high quality papers describing fully developed results or ongoing work on the topics such as:  
   
 Service-oriented architecture, engineering, and applications 
  Large-scale cyber-physical systems 
  Intelligent service composition, management and maintenance 
  Configurable and reconfigurable service middleware 
  Dependable and trustworthy services 
  Streaming and real-time data analytics 
  Mobile service engineering and applications 
  Security and privacy for intelligent service applications 
  Context-aware connected embedded computing 
  Service composition with multi-dimensional QoS 
  Service networks for smart home, smart transportation, and smart infrastructure 
  Sustainability issues on large-scale CPS applications 
   
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will be limited to 8 (IEEE style) pages. Please follow the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines to prepare your papers with 8.5'' x 11'', two-column format. The paper formatting instructions are available at http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF) is required through the paper submission system in the SOCA 2013 homepage http://conferences.computer.org/soca. All papers submitted to SOCA 2013 will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers.

 Service-oriented computing is considered today a key technology for the development of robust and high quality intelligent distributed and embedded applications. Extensive research and development in the past few years has pushed SOA technology into state-of-the-art application areas such as context-aware, cloud-connected, mobile enterprise systems. However, many of the critical components on building reliable, robust, and user-centric sensor-based SOA systems are still open for research. Hence, it is timely to reexamine SOA research opportunities and identify new research challenges for next generation SOA.

50. Conference SoCS_0:
So CS    

 International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS)   
   
 Welcome!  
 Heuristic search and combinatorial optimization  are currently very active areas of research. For example, researchers investigate how to search in real-time, how to search with limited (possibly external) memory, how to solve sequences of similar search problems faster than with isolated searches, how to improve the runtime of the searches over time, how to trade-off between the runtime and memory consumption of the search and the resulting solution quality, and how to focus the searches with sophisticated heuristics such as pattern databases. Their results are published in different conferences such as IJCAI, AAAI, ICAPS, NIPS, ICRA, and IROS.  
 The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring these researchers together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field. Thus, in addition to seeking separate answers to questions like how to design more accurate memory-based heuristics, more I/O-efficient disk-based search algorithms, or more efficient clause-learning strategies, the symposium is intended to stimulate thoughts on combining various techniques that originated in different areas of search.  
 The Eighteenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2025)  will be held from 11 to 15 August in Glasgow, Scotland. SoCS 2025 is co-located with CP 2025  and SAT 2025  .  
 To stay informed on search-related events, please join the search-list on Google groups  .
