  The term “human agent” combines concepts such as artificial societies, virtual crowds and synthetic populations. These concepts are used in various fields, such as smart city planning, emergency management and national security. Agent-based simulation models involving human agents can capture the decision-making processes of individuals as they interact with and respond to other individuals and their environment. They are also used for various research tasks, such as policy decision support, what-if scenarios, predictive modeling, and guiding data collection.  
 Of particular interest are artificial societies in which the behavior of individual agents is guided by findings from computational social sciences and calibrated using data from the real world. These heterogeneous, often cooperative agents participate in social networks, which can be physical (e.g. workplaces, schools, sporting events) or virtual (e.g. chat groups with shared interests). Human agents are generally mobile in an environment where they are exposed to social factors and physical constraints. Since multi-agent systems are based on the distributed AI paradigm, autonomy and learning, e.g. in the form of reinforcement learning, are essential components of the system.  
 Despite the many applications and resulting publications, there remain basic methodological challenges in modeling realistic human behavior. These challenges include agent representation, construction of behavioral rules, incorporation of behavioral theories and their assumptions, validation and calibration of models representing complex social phenomena, and the detection and management of emergent behavior at the societal level.  
 Therefore, authors are encouraged to submit papers related to, but not limited to, the following areas:  
 Design and implementation of human agents and artificial societies (e.g., case studies, analyses of moral and ethical considerations). 
  LLM (Large Language Model)-based agents. 
  Learning / intelligent agents. 
  The role of the non-stationary environment for the simulation result. 
  Applications of human agents and cooperative artificial societies (e.g. modeling of group decisions and collective behavior, emergence of social structures and norms, dynamics of social networks). 
  Data collection for artificial societies (e.g., using simulations to identify data gaps, population simulations with multiple data sources, use of the Internet of Things). 
  Participatory modeling and simulation 
  Policy development and evaluation through simulations 
  Improved models of social behavior 
  Simulations of societies as public educational tools 
  Mixed-methods (e.g., analyzing or generating text data with artificial societies, combining machine learning and artificial societies) 
  Models of individual decision-making, mobility patterns, or socio-environmental interactions 
  Testbeds and environments to facilitate artificial society development 
  Addressing longstanding challenges (model validation, re-use, communication)

 The past two decades have brought about a dramatic increase in the deployment of simulation-based techniques in medicine, healthcare, and human performance models. Simulation scenarios are used extensively for training of medical personnel, students, first responders, and emergency response coordinators. Rapid advances in computer technologies, biomedical engineering, and systems engineering drive the development of cyber-physical systems that serve as simulation-based training platforms. Discrete-event and agent-based models are applied to representing population-based scenarios ranging from clinics to geographical epidemiology scenarios and asking what-if questions for improved outcomes. Physiological processes are modeled and discretized through coupled equations, both in isolation and in integrative physiology contexts. Increasingly, there is also an interest in modeling these processes at several scales, spanning the molecular, to cellular, to tissue and organ-wide scales. However, it is clear that methodological and theoretical foundations need to be strengthened to provide integrated, connected, and cross-cutting solutions for modeling and simulation in medicine, healthcare and human performance optimization. Thus, this meeting will attempt to “connect” researchers, developers, and medical practitioners to define unifying themes conducive to such solutions.  
 The conference will focus on (but is not limited to) the following topical areas:  
 Modeling and simulation in medicine: fundamental research. 
  Training and education. 
  Care delivery, outcomes, and patient’s safety. 
  Robotics and its applications in training and “in vivo”. 
  Life-critical systems. 
  Systems integration: “connected health”. 
  Cybersecurity and healthcare. 
  Human performance and ergonomics models. 
  Discrete-event and agent-based approaches to healthcare. 
  Physiological modeling, from single-system to integrative approaches.

 Simulation-Based Learning (SBL): SBL refers to the use of simulation models and tools to enrich teaching and learning. SBL offers a wide range of opportunities for experiential learning and to practice critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. Research shows that SBL is among the most effective ways to learn complex skills across different domains as it enables knowledge application in a virtual yet realistic environment. Moreover, SBL educational experiences can be made available to geographically dispersed students in support of remote and online learning. All learning situations are of interest (formal/informal, in-person/distance learning, K-12, Higher Education, Professional Training, Continuing Education, etc.)  
 We encourage contributions that explore emerging trends in both Simulation Education and SBL, highlighting the potential of these tools to reshape education in the years ahead. Submissions from educators, academic researchers, industry professionals, instructional designers, educational technologists, and interdisciplinary teams are welcome, as we seek to uncover the full potential of simulation in transforming educational practices.

  The Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM) offers conference attendees a stimulating and informative selection of tutorials reflecting current topics in the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) domain. Therefore, we invite experts in the M&S domain to present engaging tutorials at the ANNSIM 2025 conference. Tutorials provide researchers and practitioners with the opportunity to introduce their applications, tools, methodologies, or theories in 90-120 minute sessions.  
 Tutorials can be introductory, oriented toward participants who are interested in broadening their knowledge, or advanced, for participants who seek the latest advances in M&S. We encourage M&S researchers and practitioners in academia, government agencies, or industry to submit proposals for tutorials. Topics of interest include M&S theories, methodologies, and tools applied to any domain.  
 While both tutorials and workshops are designed to educate participants, they differ in their format and focus. A tutorial typically focuses on teaching specific skills, tools, or methodologies through structured presentations and demonstrations. It is more lecture-based, with the primary goal being to provide practical knowledge or insights to the attendees. In contrast, a workshop is more interactive and collaborative, often involving group discussions, hands-on activities, or problem-solving sessions. Workshops aim to engage participants more directly and may include the submission of papers or other contributions.  
 Proposals should be one to two pages and must include the following information:  
 Title of the workshop/tutorial and description (max 2 pages) 
  Organizers and their affiliations (including short bios)

 General Process to Prepare and Submit a Paper      
   
 Once you decide on a paper template, the general process for preparing and submitting a conference paper is as follows:   
 Decide on a format (LaTeX is recommended but Word and Overleaf is allowed). The overleaf template is a quick way to start. 
  Modify those files to produce your submission. Remember to stay within the page limit and to remove all identifying information, as submissions are double-blind. 
  If your paper is accepted, you will have to submit to the paper submission site the final material: final version of paper (ZIP file), completed & signed Transfer of Copyright form, completed & signed Author Certification form, and a copy of your registration receipt. At least one author must register in advance for each accepted paper and come present it at the conference. 
  Submission link for ANNSIM 2025: | https://softconf.com/sim/ANNSIM25 | to submit your paper. 
    
 Policy on the use of AI in research papers:  The use of Generative AI to help with writing some of the paper must be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an SCS publication. Generative AI includes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT. If this use is specific to certain sections of the paper, we encourage authors to identify such sections (e.g., “We used GPT 4 to draft section 3.2”). The policy applies to conferences such as the Annual Modelling & Simulation Conference (ANNSIM), or extended versions submitted to the Society’s journals (Simulation: Transactions of the SCS, The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation).  

 Since 1952, SCS has been a multidisciplinary society made up of working scientists, researchers, designers, and managers that are focused on promoting the use of computer simulation. Each year, our organization holds multiple events where M&S professionals from around the world come together to advance their career development, share ideas, benchmark processes, and network with each other.  
 SCS hosts or sponsors a number of conferences each year where participants may do the following:  
  • Present Papers  
  • Attend Technical Sessions  
  • Visit Exhibit Areas  
  • Interface with Vendors  
  • Network with Other M&S Professionals  

 What We Do  
 At any of the SCS-sponsored conferences, you may present a paper or attend technical sessions. Either way, you benefit from the professional exchange of information and camaraderie created by the social environment. The conference locations are picked with the family in mind so that they can enjoy the surroundings while you participate in the event.  
 SCS also publishes the proceedings of each conference for distribution to attendees and resale to other M&S professionals. A listing of all our international publications, provided to members free of charge, can be obtained from our office.

 Publisher Description   

 This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Enterprise and Organizational Modeling and Simulation, EOMAS 2015, held at CAiSE 2015, in June 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden. EOMAS was founded with the purpose to become a forum among researchers and practitioners to share their research and practical findings by encouraging the dissemination of research results under a more generic umbrella called enterprise engineering, which encompasses internal factors ranging from organizational complexity to intricacy of business processes and sophistication in workflows as well as external factors and uncertainties such as competition, politics, or the emergence of innovative technologies. The 15 papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 28 submissions. They were organized in topical sections named: enterprise conceptual modeling and simulation; enterprise modeling formal foundation; and enterprise optimization.

  International Conference on Conceptual Modeling ER 2024 Opens Call for Papers 

 International Conference on Conceptual Modeling ER 2024 Opens Call for Papers  
      March 25, 2024  •  Article  
 Note: The deadline to submit workshop proposals has been extended to April 19.   
 March 25, 2024—  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) will host the 43rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling  from October 28-31 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The conference, also called ER 2024 after its original focus on the entity-relationship model, is accepting submissions  for papers through May 19 and workshop proposals through April 5.  
 ER 2024’s theme is Conceptual Modeling, Artificial Intelligence, and Beyond. Papers  should focus on how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing conceptual modeling. Established topics such as modeling languages, theories, and methods are also encouraged. Accepted papers will appear in a special issue of Data & Knowledge Engineering   .   
 Proposed workshops  should be interactive, collaborative forums on new, emerging, or established topics in conceptual modeling or its application in specific domains. Workshops aligned with the conference theme are especially encouraged.  
 Conceptual modeling describes “the semantics of software applications at a high level of abstraction,” according to the parent ER conference website  . Hasan Yasar  , the SEI’s technical director of continuous deployment of capability within the Software Solutions Division and the conference’s general chair, said the practice is vital for software engineering. “It provides a high-level framework for understanding and specifying the structure and behavior of the system being developed and deployed. Conceptual modeling also helps identify the key concepts and relationships in the problem domain, facilitate communication among stakeholders, guide the development process, and ensure that the software aligns with user needs and business goals.”  
 This level of rigor early in the software engineering lifecycle is especially important for new or less predictable kinds of software systems, such as those relying on ML and AI. “Conceptual modeling provides clear definitions and structures for the data and processes that ML algorithms leverage,” said Yasar. “It establishes a shared understanding of the domain, which is crucial for data preparation, feature selection, and the interpretation of AI outcomes, leading to more accurate, reliable, and transparent AI solutions.” Software engineering researchers and practitioners at ER 2024 will discuss the ontology of events and relationships as well as knowledge representation in current AI paradigms.  
 The SEI advances research in ontology and modeling across several domains, including cyber-physical systems  , large-scale applications, and digital engineering  . This research helps develop timely, effective, and reliable solutions for mission-specific challenges within Department of Defense systems.  
 The SEI joins a long list  of organizations from around the world that have hosted the ER conference since the first event in 1979. The SEI has a history of active and impactful contributions to the software engineering community and a relationship with Carnegie Mellon University, one of the world’s leading AI research institutions.  
 Learn more about ER 2024 on the SEI’s conference website  . Submit papers and workshop proposals via EasyChair  . For more information on software modeling  , model-based systems and software engineering  , and DevSecOps  , visit the SEI Blog  and Digital Library  .

 Call for Papers (Closed)  
 Conceptual Modeling, AI, and Beyond  
 As AI and ML reshape technology, they're also revolutionizing conceptual modeling. We call for papers exploring this change, particularly how AI and ML integrate with and expand conceptual modeling. Submissions should cover established topics like modeling languages, theories, and methods, as well as AI/ML's novel contributions to the field. We encourage papers that push the boundaries of conceptual modeling and demonstrate AI/ML's transformative effects. Contributions should reflect the current state and forecast the future of conceptual modeling, setting the stage for pioneering research. We also invite industry reports, vision papers, and additional “hackathon” papers.

 Since its first happening in 1993, the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks has become the reference for researchers on fundamentals and theoretical aspects of artificial neural networks, computational intelligence, machine learning and related topics. Each year, around 100-140 specialists attend ESANN, in order to present their latest results and comprehensive surveys, and to discuss the future developments in this field.  
 The ESANN 2025 conference will follow this tradition, while adapting its scope to the recent developments in the field. The ESANN conferences cover artificial neural networks, machine learning, statistical information processing and computational intelligence. Mathematical foundations, algorithms and tools, and applications are covered.  
 Papers will be presented orally (single track) and in poster sessions; all posters will be complemented by a short oral presentation during a plenary session. The selection of papers will differentiate between oral and posters presentations according to the topics, and not to the level of quality.  
 The following is a non-exhaustive list of machine learning, computational intelligence and artificial neural networks topics covered during the ESANN conferences:  
 Neural networks; Deep learning; Kernel machines; Signal processing and modeling; Transfer learning; Graphical models, EM and Bayesian learning; Classification and clustering; Vector quantization and self-organizing maps; Recurrent networks and dynamical systems; Time series forecasting; Single- and zero-shot learning; Ensemble learning; Feature selection; Graphs and networks: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction; manifold learning; Statistical and mathematical aspects of learning; Trustworthy AI; Image processing; Natural Language Processing; Data mining; Machine learning for signal processing; Multimodal interfaces and multichannel processing; Vision and sensory systems; Data visualization; Identification of non-linear dynamical systems; Machine learning for healthcare; Evolutionary computation for machine learning; Bioinformatics; Bio-inspired systems; Brain-computer interfaces

  Streaming Continual Learning: fast adaptation and knowledge consolidation in dynamic environment  
 Organized by Andrea Cossu (University of Pisa, Italy), Federico Giannini (Politecnico di Milano, Italy), Giacomo Ziffer (Politecnico di Milano, Italy), Alessio Bernardo (Politecnico di Milano, Italy), Alexander Gepperth (University of Applied Sciences Fulda, Germany), Barbara Hammer (CITEC - Bielefeld University, Germany), Emanuele Della Valle (Politecnico di Milano, Italy), Davide Bacciu (Università di Pisa, Italy)  Continual Learning (CL) and Streaming Machine Learning (SML) deal with the adaptation of learning agents in dynamic environments that change over time. However, these two communities have rarely interacted, mostly because they leverage different learning approaches and evaluate performance according to different metrics. While CL mostly focuses on consolidating knowledge over time without forgetting, often irrespective of  
  real-time requirements, SML focuses on fast and efficient adaptation on a high-frequency stream of data.  
 This special session aims to connect the CL and SML communities. While we welcome works that push the state of the art in either topic, we strongly encourage novel works at their intersection. For example, applying deep neural networks in SML scenarios could be particularly valuable in contexts where complex patterns or temporal dependencies in the data need to be captured and effectively modeled. Since memory consolidation with such models is heavily studied in CL, many existing approaches may be directly used in SML. Vice versa, the fast adaptation ability of SML models and concept drift detection methodologies can be leveraged to improve the convergence speed and forward transfer of CL. This is particularly interesting for challenging scenarios like Online CL, where the  
  high-frequency data stream is fully compatible with SML.  
 Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Continual / Lifelong learning 
  Streaming machine learning 
  Continual / Streaming Machine Learning benchmarks 
  Continual / Streaming Machine Learning libraries 
  Applications of Streaming Continual Learning 
  Online learning 
  Learning in non-stationary environments 
  Test-Time adaptation

 Foundation and Generative Models for Graphs  
 Organized by Davide Rigoni (University of Padova, Italy), Luca Pasa (University of Padova, Italy), Federico Errica (NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH, Germany), Daniele Zambon (The Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, Switzerland), Davide Bacciu (Università di Pisa, Italy), Stefano Moro (University of Padova, Italy)  Graphs are versatile abstractions that model complex systems of inter- acting entities, where interactions imply functional and/or structural depen- dencies among them. Molecular compounds and social networks are two particularly relevant instances of graph-structured data: the former can be viewed as a system of interacting atoms, where chemical bonds are influenced by factors like inter-atomic distances and atomic energies/forces depend on long-range electrostatic interactions. Instead, social networks manifest in terms of user-user and user-content interactions, where content is multimodal and includes pictures, movies, and songs. Other practical examples include the encoding of symmetries and constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, which serve as proxies for apriori knowledge.  
 The field of deep learning for graph-structured data focuses on adapt- ing deep learning techniques, such as convolutional operators, to the analysis and processing of graphs. Recent advancements in foundation and generative models for non-graph data have significantly impacted businesses, with an unprecedented speed of adoption in production environments. It is therefore natural to ask ourselves whether such advances can be readily transferred to the domain of graphs, and what the best way to do so would be, opening new avenues for research and applications. In this respect, there are high expectations in areas such as drug discovery, where the ability to generate molecular constraint-preserving graphs with desired properties might reduce the humongous amount of money and compute time needed to screen candi- date drugs.  
 This special session aims to gather valuable contributionsbac and new find- ings in the field of deep learning for graphs. It will also emphasize the integration of foundation and generative models to enhance the creation and manipulation of graph-structured data, unlocking new possibilities in areas such as molecular and material design.  
 In particular, we look for contributions in the following areas:  
 Architectures for foundation models operating on graphs; 
  Graph generation (e.g., probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, normalizing flow, diffusion models); 
  Graph representation learning; 
  Graph structure learning and relational inference; 
  Graph coarsening and pooling in graph neural networks; 
  Theory of graph neural networks (e.g., expressive power, learnability, negative results); 
  Learning on complex graphs (e.g., dynamic graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and spatio-temporal data); 
  Anomaly and change detection in graph data; 
  Randomized neural networks for graphs (e.g., reservoir computing); 
  Recurrent, recursive, and contextual models; 
  Scalability, data efficiency, and training techniques of graph neural net- works; 
  Tensor methods for structured data; 
  Graph datasets and benchmarks. 

 Graph Generation for Life Sciences  
 Organized by Pietro Bongini (SAILAB - University of Siena, Italy), Niccolò Pancino (University of Siena, Italy), Veronica Lachi (università degli studi di Siena, Italy), Caterina Graziani (Università degli Studi di Siena, Italy), Elia Giuseppe Ceroni (Università degli Studi di Siena, Italy), Franco Scarselli (University of Siena, Italy)  Graph generation is developing fast as a new research branch for deep learning models, leading to remarkable solutions across various application domains, including Social Network Analysis, Recommendation Systems, Telecommunications and Power Grids, Supply Chain & Logistics, and others.  
  Graph generators can create graph structures with different characteristics and purposes. This special session is dedicated both to theoretical advancements in algorithms and models that are driving these innovations, as well as practical applications and real-world results, with a particular interest in life sciences.  
 This special session welcomes contributions that explore various graph generation methodologies in life sciences, such as sequential methods, graph variational autoencoders, and graph diffusion models. A particular emphasis will be devoted to new and promising directions for future exploration in the research community, such as, for example: conditional and hierarchical graph generation techniques, graph diffusion models, very deep networks for graph generation.

 Statistical learning and modelling with longitudinal data for socio-economic and biomedical applications  
 Organized by Miguel Atencia (Universidad de Málaga, Spain), Madalina Olteanu (CEREMADE - Université Paris Dauphine PSL, France)  Longitudinal data arise in a variety of real-life applications where individuals are observed during their lifetime or some given timespan. Their modelling represents a challenging topic, due to their complexity (temporal, censored, multivariate, possibly irregularly sampled, possibly multimodal information including text, images, …). For example, aging is the human temporal process par excellence, and projects like ARLES aim at exploring Aging Risks and their Long-term impact on the Economy and Society by means of mathematical models. In this session, we welcome both theoretical and methodological contributions, as well as practical implementations related to or applicable to the analysis of longitudinal data in social and biomedical sciences. Particular interest will be given to proposals focusing on the analysis of stochastic processes for population evolution, heavy tailed distributions, change-point detection, hybridisation with functional data methods, and the use of neural networks for modelling and forecasting these specific data. On the side of applications, we expect contributions using data from the social or the biomedical fields, like for instance, the design of aging clocks from the statistical analysis of biomarkers. Eventually, through this session we wish to enhance the availability of data and methods in these domains and foster multidisciplinary collaboration among research groups.  

 Machine learning and applied Artificial Intelligence in cognitive sciences and psychology  
 Organized by Caroline König (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain), Alfredo Vellido (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC BarcelonaTech), España), Steffen Moritz (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany), Susana Ochoa Güerre (Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain)  On the wake of the finalisation of the European flagship Human Brain Project and similar initiatives around the world, it has become clear that Cognitive Science has become a data-centric endeavour. Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary research field comprising neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. In particular, mental health is an important topic both for Cognitive Science and Healthcare. Data-based approaches stemming from Artificial Intelligence and particularly from Machine Learning are important tools in the pursuit of personalized medicine goals as means for improvement in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. In the medical domain in general, both the trustworthiness of models and the explainability of methods are relevant for the adoption of such machine learning-based approaches in clinical diagnosis and treatment. This session will consider developments in the field of applied Artificial Intelligence for Cognitive Science, with a focus on medical applications. Topics of interest are, among others:  
 Neuroscience 
  Psychology and Psychiatry 
  Neurodegenerative diseases 
  Linguistics 
  Philosophy 
  Artificial Intelligence applications for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cognitive impairments and pathologies. 
  Patient cohort analysis. 
  Interpretable and explainable artificial intelligence methods in Cognitive Science. 
  Personalized medicine. 
  Artificial Intelligence–based medical devices regulation. 

 Network Science Meets AI  
 Organized by Matteo Zignani (University of Milan, Italy), Fragkiskos D. Malliaros (Université Paris-Saclay, France), Ingo Scholtes (Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany), Roberto Interdonato (CIRAD, France), Manuel Dileo (University of Milan, Italy)  The intersection of Network Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a burgeon- ing field that promises to revolutionize our understanding and management of complex systems. This special session, titled ”Network Science Meets AI,” aims to bring together researchers from both disciplines to explore the synergies and innovative applications that arise from their convergence. Network Science has provided a unified framework for representing complex systems through the lens of interactions among elements, often captured by networks that evolve over time and different types of relationships among the same set of elements. This framework has revealed universal properties such as scale-free nature, robust- ness, resilience, and modular structure. It has also deepened our understanding of the dynamics and controllability of complex networks, particularly in areas like contagion processes and epidemic models. On the other hand, AI is transforming various scientific disciplines by introducing new paradigms for scientific discovery. The capabilities of AI to solve highly complex problems, such as protein structure prediction, drug discovery, and content creation through generative AI, are nearing human-level performance.  
 This special session is aimed at contributions at the intersection between net- work science and AI, where AI offers new tools to tackle problems in network science, or, vice versa, network science supports the design and understanding of AI methods. There are multiple areas where a stronger interaction between network science and AI is promising: For instance, novel paradigms to describe high-order interactions through hypergraphs or simplicial complexes are closely linked to current challenges in the domain of representation learning. This also influences solutions for problems such as label, link, and network property prediction, or for combinatorial optimization problems on networks. Simulating and understanding dynamical processes in complex networks is another key challenge in network science that can benefit from AI, particularly from the capacity to handle non-linear relationships among system elements and non- linearity in the system dynamics. Being able to infer dynamical equations in a data-driven fashion is crucial for the simulation of network dynamics and node/link attribute dynamics along with generating plausible networks related to real-world systems, such as proteins, molecules, transportation systems, or even social networks. Moreover, it is equally important to consider the contribution of network science to advance methods in AI and machine learning. The development of graph neural networks that are based on neural message passing is an important research theme in the deep learning community. Existing insights into the topology of complex networks can greatly assist the design of such deep neural networks for graph-structured data. Moreover, recent works have shown that objective functions for community detection originally devised in the network science community can be repurposed for cluster detection based on deep graph learning. Finally, deep neural networks themselves are becoming instances of complex systems, thus turning into a subject of interest in network science. To this end, network science methods can be used to understand or optimize the structure of deep neural networks. Furthermore, methods for the analysis of dynamics processes can advance the comprehension of the learning processes of the parameters as well as the dynamics of the inference phases. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Optimizing GNN architectures using Network Science principles 
  Novel message passing schemes inspired by complex network dynamics 
  Topology-aware neural network design 
  Representation learning for hypergraphs and simplicial complexes 
  Deep learning models for higher-order interactions 
  AI-driven prediction of network evolution 
  Deep learning approaches for temporal network embedding 
  Neural ODEs for network dynamics 
  Explainable graph machine learning algorithms 
  Explainability techniques for graph machine learning 
  Network Generation and Synthesis 
  Topological analysis of deep neural networks 
  Transfer of network science objectives to deep learning (e.g. community detection, influence maximization, epidemic modeling) 
  Theoretical foundations of graph machine learning methods 
  Causal discovery in complex networks 
  Topology-aware optimization algorithms

 Quantum, Quantum Inspired and Hybrid Machine Learning  
 Organized by Hans-Martin Rieser (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) - Institut für KI-Sicherheit, Germany), Markus Lange (Institute for AI-Safety and Security German Aerospace Center (DLR) , Germany), M. Lautaro Hickmann (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) - Institut für KI-Sicherheit , Germany)  Quantum physics offers a new paradigm that promises to make certain computations faster and more efficient. The recent progress of quantum computers allows for more com- plex applications which lead to a rising interest in transferring machine learning methods to quantum hardware for practical applications. However, the development of quantum computers is still in its beginnings and currently these approaches requires synergy with classical computers. Moreover, many fundamental questions have not yet been answered. In this session, we would therefore not only look into machine learning on quantum computers themselves, but also into their efficient interplay with classical computers and the open questions that need to be answered on the way to genuine Quantum Machine Learn- ing. These includes topics like classical pre-processing, efficient encoding strategies, and quantum-classical hybrid models, as well as, purely classical machine learning approaches inspired by quantum physics, such as tensor networks.

 ESEM  
 ESEM, the International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, is the premier empirical software engineering and measurement conference.  
 The objective of the International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) is to provide a forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can report and discuss the most recent research results, innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the field of empirical software engineering and metrics.  
 ESEM conference encourages the exchange of ideas that help explore, understand, and model phenomena in software engineering from an empirical viewpoint. The conference focuses on the processes, design and structure of empirical studies, and the results of specific studies. Studies may vary from controlled experiments to field studies and from quantitative to qualitative studies.  
 ESEM committees care about fundamental ethical values related to diversity, as gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and similar personal traits. Diversity will be sought at different levels, remarkably including conference committees' composition.  
 ESEM conference organizers will set as highest priority to provide a welcoming, respectful and positive atmosphere to all attendees. Aggressive or offensive language will not be allowed in talks, questions or answers. Aggressive or offensive behaviour, including any type of harassing, will not be allowed in the event, being a justified reason for expulsion without any compensation.  
 All ESEM conference committees as well as authors are obliged to follow and apply Ethical Guidelines as available at ACM  and IEEE  .  
 On this web site you can find information about the ESEM conference series as well as useful information for organizing a future ESEM conference.

 ESEIW 2024 & ESEM 2024  
   
 Welcome to the joint website of ESEIW 2024  , the Empirical Software Engineering International Week 2024, and ESEM 2024  , the 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement.  
 The ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) is the premier conference for presenting research results related to empirical software engineering. ESEM provides a stimulating forum where researchers and practitioners can present and discuss recent research results on a wide range of topics, in addition to exchanging ideas, experiences, and challenging problems.  
 Program Overview   
   
  Keynotes   
 Sira Vegas (UPM): The Method Behind the Magic: Ensuring Reliability in Software Engineering Empirical Results   

  Empirical software engineering research plays a critical role in advancing the field, but the reliability of findings depends heavily on the rigor of the methodology. In this keynote, I will discuss the importance of addressing key aspects of validity—internal, construct, and statistical conclusion validity—when conducting empirical studies. Using two prevalent research areas, Mining Software Repositories (MSR) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, I will illustrate common methodological challenges. Through these examples, I will explore potential strategies and considerations for improving study design and analysis, aiming to enhance the reliability and scientific contribution of empirical software engineering studies, ultimately driving more robust insights and advancements in the field.  
  
 David Lo (Singapore Management University): Charting New Frontiers: Exploring Limits, Threats, and Ecosystems of LLMs in Software Engineering   

  Large language models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering, but their adoption brings critical challenges. In this keynote, I will explore three key thrusts: the limits  of LLMs, including their struggles with long-tailed data distributions and the quality of generated outputs; the threats  they pose, such as their robustness, vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks and the memorization of sensitive information; and the emerging ecosystems  surrounding their reuse, licensing, and documentation practices. Empirical research plays a pivotal role in uncovering these challenges and guiding the responsible development of LLMs in software engineering. By addressing these issues, we can chart a path forward for future research and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

 ESEIW 2024 & ESEM 2024  
   
 Welcome to the joint website of ESEIW 2024  , the Empirical Software Engineering International Week 2024, and ESEM 2024  , the 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement.  
 The ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) is the premier conference for presenting research results related to empirical software engineering. ESEM provides a stimulating forum where researchers and practitioners can present and discuss recent research results on a wide range of topics, in addition to exchanging ideas, experiences, and challenging problems.  
 Program Overview   
   
  Keynotes   
 Sira Vegas (UPM): The Method Behind the Magic: Ensuring Reliability in Software Engineering Empirical Results   

  Empirical software engineering research plays a critical role in advancing the field, but the reliability of findings depends heavily on the rigor of the methodology. In this keynote, I will discuss the importance of addressing key aspects of validity—internal, construct, and statistical conclusion validity—when conducting empirical studies. Using two prevalent research areas, Mining Software Repositories (MSR) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, I will illustrate common methodological challenges. Through these examples, I will explore potential strategies and considerations for improving study design and analysis, aiming to enhance the reliability and scientific contribution of empirical software engineering studies, ultimately driving more robust insights and advancements in the field.  
  
 David Lo (Singapore Management University): Charting New Frontiers: Exploring Limits, Threats, and Ecosystems of LLMs in Software Engineering   

  Large language models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering, but their adoption brings critical challenges. In this keynote, I will explore three key thrusts: the limits  of LLMs, including their struggles with long-tailed data distributions and the quality of generated outputs; the threats  they pose, such as their robustness, vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks and the memorization of sensitive information; and the emerging ecosystems  surrounding their reuse, licensing, and documentation practices. Empirical research plays a pivotal role in uncovering these challenges and guiding the responsible development of LLMs in software engineering. By addressing these issues, we can chart a path forward for future research and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

  Call for Papers   
 The International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement  (ESEM) Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection papers track features submissions that describe current work in progress from research or practice. Papers should clearly state the longer-term objectives and outline a plan for working towards those objectives.  
 Emerging Results  communicate initial research results of new ideas to obtain feedback from the empirical software engineering community. Vision papers  must describe long-term challenges and opportunities in empirical software engineering research and practice that are outside of current mainstream topics. Reflection  papers discuss the current impact and implications of studies published in a partnered journal (TSE, IST, EMSE, JSS, TOSEM) from between 3 and 10 years ago (i.e., 2014-2021).  

 General Scope of Submissions   
 Submissions should not  be under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In addition to the specific scope of this track, submissions may address any aspect of software engineering but must tackle the problem from an empirical perspective and using a rigorous empirical method, including:  
 Empirical studies using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods 
  Cross- and multi-disciplinary methods and studies 
  Formal experiments and quasi-experiments 
  Case studies, action research, ethnography and field studies 
  Survey research 
  Simulation studies 
  Artifact studies 
  Data mining using statistical and machine learning approaches 
  Secondary and tertiary studies including | Systematic literature reviews and rapid reviews, that include a strong synthesis part 
  Meta-analyses, and qualitative, quantitative or structured syntheses of studies 
  Replication of empirical studies and families of studies 
  Topics commonly addressed using an empirical approach include, but are not limited to:  
 Evaluation and comparison of software models, tools, techniques, and practices 
  Modeling, measuring, and assessing product or process quality and productivity 
  Continuous software engineering 
  Software verification and validation, including analysis and testing 
  Engineering of software systems which include machine learning components and data dependencies 
  Applications of software engineering to different types of systems and domains (e.g. IoT, Industry 4.0, Context-awareness systems, Cyber-physical systems) 
  Human factors, teamwork, and behavioral aspects of software engineering 
  We welcome submissions on these research meta-topics:  
 Development, evaluation, and comparison of empirical approaches and methods 
  Infrastructure for conducting empirical studies 
  Techniques and tools for supporting empirical studies 
  Empirically-based decision making 
  We also welcome submissions that:  
 demonstrate multi-disciplinary work, 
  transfer and apply empirical methods from other disciplines, 
  replication studies, and 
  studies with negative findings.

  Notification:  July 17, 2024  July 22, 2024  
  Camera-ready:  September 6, 2024  

 How to Submit   
 Submissions to this track are limited to 6 pages plus one page with references and must be submitted through EasyChair by selecting the track “Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection Papers”. All submissions must be written in English and must be submitted via EasyChair  in PDF format.  
 Please note:   
 Make sure the paper follows the standard ACM Proceedings template (see https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ). 
  Make sure your paper follows the double-blind instructions and does not reveal the authors’ identities. 
  The submission must also comply with the IEEE ethics guidelines IEEE ethics guidelines  . In particular, it must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review elsewhere while under review for ESEM. 
  The ESEM 2024 Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection Papers track will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, submissions may not reveal their authors’ identities. The authors must make an acceptable effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person. More details on author ethics and peer review can be found at https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/  .  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three experts from the international program committee of the track and will receive an additional meta-review. Any papers that are outside the scope of the symposium, exceed the maximum number of pages for the respective category, or do not follow the formatting guidelines will be desk rejected without review. The PC members’ bidding information may be used to assess what is considered out of scope.  
 Finally, please note that each accepted contribution must have a minimum of one author registered by the deadline for the camera-ready submission for their respective paper type. Also, each paper must be presented by one of the authors. Failure to meet these criteria will result in the paper’s removal from the proceedings.  

 Open Science Policy   
 Openness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. While all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether or not they disclose their tools, data, and code, we expect authors to include a data availability statement in their submissions that either provides links to the open data/replication package or that explains why data cannot be disclosed  (e.g., due to the sensitivity of the data or due to existing non-disclosure agreements). We recommend adding the data availability statement in the submission at the end of the introduction section explaining whether and where the data and related material is available and under which conditions the data/material can be accessed. For submissions based on open data sources, the publication of any cleaned or filtered data is mandatory.   
 To submit your tools, data, and code while still following the double-blind process, please refer to these guidelines  .  
 Authors are requested to share their tools, data, and code in the form of a replication package, and provide explanations on how to use and navigate it.  
 Qualitative studies should provide explanations about the study protocol, coding and transcription schemas, and further relevant information. 
  Quantitative studies should include information about the source code and its main dependencies (incl. version), description of input/output relevant to every step of data cleaning and labeling, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 
  We recommend providing these explanations in the method section of the paper, while further explanations and concrete instructions on how to navigate and use the replication package can be detailed in a README file.  
 We recommend to:  
 Share pre-prints in a non-commercial repository (e.g., arXiv) using an appropriate license (e.g., arXiv default non-exclusive license, Creative Commons CC-BY). When sharing pre-prints, authors must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to ESEM 2024. We recommend against anonymizing them (i.e., by changing authors, title, abstract). The review committee members are instructed NOT to try to find out the identity of authors. 
  Share replication packages in an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo) using an appropriate license (e.g., based on Creative Commons). 
  For further information, please refer to “Open Science in Software Engineering”  book chapter and feel free to approach the Open Science chairs (Davide Fucci < davide.fucci@bth.se  > and Martin Solari < martin.solari@ort.edu.uy  >)

  Call for Papers   
 The International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement  (ESEM) Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection papers track features submissions that describe current work in progress from research or practice. Papers should clearly state the longer-term objectives and outline a plan for working towards those objectives.  
 Emerging Results  communicate initial research results of new ideas to obtain feedback from the empirical software engineering community. Vision papers  must describe long-term challenges and opportunities in empirical software engineering research and practice that are outside of current mainstream topics. Reflection  papers discuss the current impact and implications of studies published in a partnered journal (TSE, IST, EMSE, JSS, TOSEM) from between 3 and 10 years ago (i.e., 2014-2021).  

 General Scope of Submissions   
 Submissions should not  be under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In addition to the specific scope of this track, submissions may address any aspect of software engineering but must tackle the problem from an empirical perspective and using a rigorous empirical method, including:

 How to Submit   
 Submissions to this track are limited to 6 pages plus one page with references and must be submitted through EasyChair by selecting the track “Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection Papers”. All submissions must be written in English and must be submitted via EasyChair  in PDF format.  
 Please note:   
 Make sure the paper follows the standard ACM Proceedings template (see https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ). 
  Make sure your paper follows the double-blind instructions and does not reveal the authors’ identities. 
  The submission must also comply with the IEEE ethics guidelines IEEE ethics guidelines  . In particular, it must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review elsewhere while under review for ESEM. 
  The ESEM 2024 Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection Papers track will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, submissions may not reveal their authors’ identities. The authors must make an acceptable effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person. More details on author ethics and peer review can be found at https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/  .  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three experts from the international program committee of the track and will receive an additional meta-review. Any papers that are outside the scope of the symposium, exceed the maximum number of pages for the respective category, or do not follow the formatting guidelines will be desk rejected without review. The PC members’ bidding information may be used to assess what is considered out of scope.  
 Finally, please note that each accepted contribution must have a minimum of one author registered by the deadline for the camera-ready submission for their respective paper type. Also, each paper must be presented by one of the authors. Failure to meet these criteria will result in the paper’s removal from the proceedings.  

 Open Science Policy   
 Openness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. While all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether or not they disclose their tools, data, and code, we expect authors to include a data availability statement in their submissions that either provides links to the open data/replication package or that explains why data cannot be disclosed  (e.g., due to the sensitivity of the data or due to existing non-disclosure agreements). We recommend adding the data availability statement in the submission at the end of the introduction section explaining whether and where the data and related material is available and under which conditions the data/material can be accessed. For submissions based on open data sources, the publication of any cleaned or filtered data is mandatory.   
 To submit your tools, data, and code while still following the double-blind process, please refer to these guidelines  .  
 Authors are requested to share their tools, data, and code in the form of a replication package, and provide explanations on how to use and navigate it.  
 Qualitative studies should provide explanations about the study protocol, coding and transcription schemas, and further relevant information. 
  Quantitative studies should include information about the source code and its main dependencies (incl. version), description of input/output relevant to every step of data cleaning and labeling, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 
  We recommend providing these explanations in the method section of the paper, while further explanations and concrete instructions on how to navigate and use the replication package can be detailed in a README file.  
 We recommend to:  
 Share pre-prints in a non-commercial repository (e.g., arXiv) using an appropriate license (e.g., arXiv default non-exclusive license, Creative Commons CC-BY). When sharing pre-prints, authors must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to ESEM 2024. We recommend against anonymizing them (i.e., by changing authors, title, abstract). The review committee members are instructed NOT to try to find out the identity of authors. 
  Share replication packages in an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo) using an appropriate license (e.g., based on Creative Commons). 
  For further information, please refer to “Open Science in Software Engineering”  book chapter and feel free to approach the Open Science chairs (Davide Fucci < davide.fucci@bth.se  > and Martin Solari < martin.solari@ort.edu.uy  >)

 Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action   .   Th  e aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in computer security by fostering a European community that bridges academia and industry in this realm. Sequentially hosted across various European nations, the symposium has solidified its position as one of Europe's most prominent conferences on computer security. Currently, the symposium delves into research and developmental avenues encompassing AI, machine learning, technologies that enhance privacy, network safeguards, software and hardware protection in practical scenarios.    
 After successful events at Fraunhofer (Germany, 2021), DTU (Denmark, 2022), TU Delft (The Netherlands, 2023) and Bydgoszcz University   ( Poland, 2024),   the 30th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) 2025  will be held at U niversité Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier  in Toulouse, France  .    
    
 Let's meet from 22 to 26 September 2025 (22-24 Main Conference, 25-26 Workshops).

  Rebuttal: | December 3-5, 2024 
  Notification: | December 19, 2024 
  The important dates are available in the Joint Call for Papers  .  

 Submission Categories  
 Submit paper   
   
 ESOP 2025 solicits three forms of contributions:  
 Research Papers  are articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of programming languages and systems. | For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, ACM’s PACMPL, or ACM’s TOPLAS format. There is no page limit for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are likely to balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready papers may not exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS. 
  Experience Reports  are articles reporting on systems and techniques developed in practice, such as artifacts tools, mechanized proofs, and educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported. Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Fresh Perspectives  are articles that promote new insights on programming languages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer new tutorial perspectives of known concepts, or they may introduce fresh new insights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments. Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  The paper review process will be double-blind  . Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).  
 Accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Springer’s formatting style files and other information can be found on the Springer website.  
 The papers can be submitted here  .  

 Paper Submission And Evaluation  
   
 We welcome paper submissions at both submission rounds. Submissions of each round will be reviewed by the PC and external reviewers for their technical soundness and originality.  
 Round 1 submissions will receive one of three outcomes: Accept, Reject, Revise. In the latter case, the PC will provide a concrete list of revision requests to be completed by the Round 2 submission deadline. Such revised submissions will be reviewed by the same set of reviewers and will either be accepted or rejected. Rejected Round 1 submissions may NOT  be resubmitted to Round 2.  
 Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected.  

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 ESOP 2025 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision. Note: artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including 1-page bibliography), that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 Detailed information can be found here  .

 Journal-First Submissions  
   
 ESOP research papers submitted by the round 1 deadline are eligible to the Journal First channel, if marked so at submission time. The requirements of TOPLAS apply to these submissions. Accepted Journal First papers will appear in the ESOP proceedings as a 3-page extended abstract (excluding bibliography), will be presented at the conference, and published at TOPLAS. ESOP Journal First submissions will be reviewed by the ESOP PC, with an additional review coordinated with TOPLAS. After submission, Journal-First papers will not be allowed to switch to a different paper category; yet the ESOP PC reserves the right to treat a Journal-First submission as a regular ESOP submission, in which case, the paper will be eligible for the Journal-After publication scheme.  

 Journal-After Submissions  
   
 Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January at a predefined date after the ESOP notification, and to which all accepted papers may apply. A first light review round will be performed by the ESOP PC, to reach Reject or Revise decisions. Papers with Revise decisions will proceed to a second thorough review round, in which additional reviews will be coordinated with TOPLAS towards a final Reject or Accept decision.

 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

 Call for Papers: Research Track  
  
 The research track of ESWC 2025 is looking for contributions addressing theoretical, analytical, and empirical aspects of the Semantic Web, knowledge graphs and semantic technologies in general and their relation with AI. We also encourage contributions at the intersection of these domains and other scientific disciplines. Submissions to the research track should describe novel, significant research, and are expected to provide a principled evaluation.  
 Submissions are solicited in the following domains of interest:  
 Semantic Web Foundations and Semantic Technologies   
 Knowledge representation, ontologies, rules, shapes, and reasoning (within and beyond Description Logics) 
  Ontology analysis and design 
  Reuse, modularization, matching, integration, and fusion of ontologies 
  Ontology-based data access 
  Knowledge Graphs   
 Knowledge graph construction 
  Query processing over knowledge graphs 
  Provenance and management 
  Reuse, modularization, matching, integration, and fusion of knowledge graphs 
  Structured, semi-structured and unstructured data to knowledge graph matching 
  Knowledge Graphs construction and probing with Foundational Language Models 
  Decentralized and federated knowledge graphs 
  Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Semantics    
 Generative AI and semantics 
  Machine learning on or for semantic sources 
  Hybrid learning and reasoning systems (explainability, neuro-symbolic) 
  Natural Language Processing for semantic sources 
  (Large) Language Models for semantic sources 
  Retrieval Augmented Generation with knowledge graphs 
  Representation learning and embeddings for knowledge graphs 
  Data Quality, Privacy, and Trust   
 Data quality, transparency, ethics and trust 
  Fairness and bias 
  Privacy and security 
  Semantics on the Web and Interoperability   
 Linked data 
  FAIR data management 
  Internet of things 
  Information retrieval 
  Data dynamics, streaming data, and mobile platforms 
  Science and research data management 
  Human and Social Aspects   
 Social and human aspects of the Semantic Web 
  Crowdsourcing and human-in-the-loop for knowledge engineering 
  User interfaces, usability, and accessibility 
  Positioning and delineations  
 Other tracks | : We strongly recommend that prospective authors carefully check the calls of the other main tracks of the conference in order to identify the optimal track for their submission. Papers that propose new algorithms and architectures should continue to be submitted to the regular research track. 
  Papers that reuse and apply state-of-the art semantic technology or resources in practical settings should be submitted to the in-use track (i.e., the novelty falls into the in-use application of the semantic technology or resource). 
  Authors who want to present an interesting industry application but who do not want to submit a full paper should submit to the industry track. 
  Papers describing concrete resources (datasets, ontologies, vocabularies, annotated corpora, workflows, knowledge graphs, evaluation benchmarks, etc.) should be submitted to the resources track. 
  Note that research, in-use and resource papers are published within the same proceedings by Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Positioning with respect to the Machine Learning Community  : Contributions should be clearly related to the Semantic Web or have an impact in the field of semantics. The scope of the conference is semantic technologies and how they enable new research and applications. While semantic technologies are part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including aspects of Data Management and Artificial Intelligence, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), it remains a distinct scholarly field, with its own research methods, tools, and challenges. Therefore, contributions to other disciplines that have no direct impact on the landscape of semantic technologies are not relevant to the ESWC conference.  
 Use of LLM generated text  : For ESWC 2025, we adhere to the principles and guidelines stated in the ACM Policy on Authorship  specifically about “Criteria for Authorship” regarding the use of Generative AI technologies for authoring papers: “ Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work. (…) Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work. As the line between Generative AI tools and basic word processing systems like MS-Word or Grammarly becomes blurred, this Policy will be updated.  ”  
 In case of any questions regarding this policy, please contact the organizing committee.  
 Review Criteria  
 Papers in the research track will be reviewed according to the following criteria:  
 Relevance to the Semantic Web conference 
  Novelty 
  Originality 
  Impact of the research contributions 
  Soundness 
  Design and execution of the evaluation of the work 
  Clarity and quality of presentation 
  Grounding in the literature and related work 
  Reproducibility and availability of resources 
  We also encourage the submission of interesting and sound approaches, even if these do not fully outperform the state of the art. All papers should include evaluations of the approaches described in the paper. Evaluation metrics should be explained and justified.  
 Negative results should be reported as well. Evaluations should be repeatable, and papers should provide links to the data sets, source code (including all the external dependencies and versions, as well as the necessary parameters), queries, and other resources.

The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

  Call For Papers   
   
 The research track of ESWC 2025 is looking for contributions addressing theoretical, analytical, and empirical aspects of the Semantic Web, knowledge graphs and semantic technologies in general and their relation with AI. We also encourage contributions at the intersection of these domains and other scientific disciplines. Submissions to the research track should describe novel, significant research, and are expected to provide a principled evaluation. Submissions are solicited in the following domains of interest: Semantic Web Foundations and Semantic Technologies Knowledge representation, ontologies, rules, shapes, and reasoning (within and beyond Description Logics) Ontology analysis and design Reuse, modularization, matching, integration, and fusion of ontologies Ontology-based data access Knowledge Graphs Knowledge graph construction Query processing over knowledge graphs Provenance and management Reuse, modularization, matching, integration, and fusion of knowledge graphs Structured, semi-structured and unstructured data to knowledge graph matching Knowledge Graphs construction and probing with Foundational Language Models Decentralized and federated knowledge graphs Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Semantics Generative AI and semantics Machine learning on or for semantic sources Hybrid learning and reasoning systems (explainability, neuro-symbolic) Natural Language Processing for semantic sources (Large) Language Models for semantic sources Retrieval Augmented Generation with knowledge graphs Representation learning and embeddings for knowledge graphs Data Quality, Privacy, and Trust Data quality, transparency, ethics and trust Fairness and bias Privacy and security Semantics on the Web and Interoperability Linked data FAIR data management Internet of things Information retrieval Data dynamics, streaming data, and mobile platforms Science and research data management Human and Social Aspects Social and human aspects of the Semantic Web Crowdsourcing and human-in-the-loop for knowledge engineering User interfaces, usability, and accessibility Positioning and delineations Other tracks: We strongly recommend that prospective authors carefully check the calls of the other main tracks of the conference in order to identify the optimal track for their submission. Papers that propose new algorithms and architectures should continue to be submitted to the regular research track. Papers that reuse and apply state-of-the art semantic technology or resources in practical settings should be submitted to the in-use track (i.e., the novelty falls into the in-use application of the semantic technology or resource). Authors who want to present an interesting industry application but who do not want to submit a full paper should submit to the industry track. Papers describing concrete resources (datasets, ontologies, vocabularies, annotated corpora, workflows, knowledge graphs, evaluation benchmarks, etc.) should be submitted to the resources track.

 The Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC)  , formerly the European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), the European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), and initially the European Semantic Web Symposium (ESWS), aims to bring together researchers and practioners dealing with different aspects of semantics on the Web.  
 Until 2007 ESWC was organized by the SDK project cluster (SDK Cluster projects: Semantic Knowledge Technologies (SEKT), Data, Information, and Process Integration with Semantic Web Services (DIP), Knowledge Web (KW)) and its successor, the European Semantic Systems Initiative (ESSI). Since 2008 ESWC is organized by the Semantic Technology Institute International (STI International).  
 From 2010-2012 the “European” became the “Extended” Semantic Web Conference to underline the extended scope and international character behind this event, “to extend its focus by engaging with other communities within and outside ICT, in which semantics can play an important role.”, but also due to the acquisition of the European Semantic Technology Conference (ESTC) by Mediabistro in 2011. In 2023 the name was changed again from “European” to “Extended” Semantic Web Conference but it is still listed as “European” conference.

 Call for Participation: Peace!

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

Logic List Mailing Archive  
 CfP: ESOP 2025: 34rd European Symposium on Programming, 5–8 May 2025, Hamilton (Canada)  
 ******************************************************************************* ESOP 2025 34rd European Symposium on Programming Hamilton, Canada, 5–8 May 2025 Call for Papers ******************************************************************************* What is new in 2025? ==================== ESOP features two submission rounds in 2025. ESOP introduces an optional journal-first channel on round 1. Scope ===== ESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems. ESOP is a part of the ETAPS conference. ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming language research including, but not limited to, the following areas: * programming paradigms and styles * methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages * programming language foundations * methods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution * applications and emerging topics Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly welcome. Important Dates - ESOP ====================== ESOP 2025 features a two-round submission scheme. Round 1: Submission deadline: May 30, 2024 Rebuttal: July 23-25, 2024 Notification: August 8, 2024 Round 2: Submission deadline: October 10, 2024 Rebuttal: December 3-5, 2024 Notification: December 19, 2024 Important Dates - ETAPS ======================= Submission deadline for TACAS, FoSSaCS, FASE: 10 October 2024, 23:59 AoE TACAS mandatory artifact submission deadline: 24 October 2024 Rebuttal (ESOP, FoSSaCS, partially TACAS): Tuesday 3 December - Thursday 5 December 2024 Paper notification and TACAS mandatory artifact notification: 20 December 2024 ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS artifact, TACAS voluntary artifact submission deadline: 9 January 2025 Artifact notification ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS, TACAS (voluntary artifacts): 13 February 2025 Main Conference: 5–8 May 2025 Submission Categories ===================== ESOP 2025 solicits three forms of contributions: * Research Papers are articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of programming languages and systems. * For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, ACM’s PACMPL, or ACM’s TOPLAS format. There is no page limit for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are likely to balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready papers may not exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS. * Experience Reports are articles reporting on systems and techniques developed in practice, such as artifacts, tools, mechanized proofs, and educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported. Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography). * Fresh Perspectives are articles that promote new insights on programming languages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer new tutorial perspectives of known concepts, or they may introduce fresh new insights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments. Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography). Accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Springer’s formatting style files and other information can be found on the Springer website. The papers can be submitted here: https://esop25.mpi-sws.org/ Paper Submission And Evaluation =============================== We welcome paper submissions at both submission rounds. Submissions of each round will be reviewed by the PC and external reviewers for their technical soundness and originality. Round 1 submissions will receive one of three outcomes: Accept, Reject, Revise. In the latter case, the PC will provide a concrete list of revision requests to be completed by the Round 2 submission deadline. Such revised submissions will be reviewed by the same set of reviewers and will either be accepted or rejected. Rejected Round 1 submissions may NOT be resubmitted to Round 2. Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected. Artifact Evaluation =================== ESOP 2025 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision. Note: artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including 1-page bibliography), that will appear in the conference proceedings. Program Committee ================= PC Chair: Viktor Vafeiadis (Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Kaiserslautern) PC Members: Kazuyuki Asada (Tohoku University) Dariusz Biernacki (University of Wrocław) Laura Bocchi (University of Kent) James Cheney (University of Edinburgh) Brijesh Dongol (University of Surrey) Jana Dunfield (Queen’s University at Kingston) Javier Esparza (Technical University of Munich) Simon Fowler (University of Glasgow) Jacques-Henri Jourdan (CNRS) Burcu Kulahcioglu Ozkan (Delft University of Technology) Hongjin Liang (Nanjing University) Umang Mathur (National University of Singapore) Peter Müller (ETH Zürich) David Pichardie (Meta) Jean Pichon (Aarhus University) Noam Rinetzky (Tel Aviv University) Amr Sabry (Indiana University) Michael Sammler (ETH Zürich) Sam Staton (Oxford) Milijana Surbatovich (University of Maryland College Park) Niki Vazou (IMDEA Software Institute) Tobias Wrigstad (Uppsala University) Journal-First Submissions ========================= ESOP research papers submitted by the round 1 deadline are eligible to the Journal First channel, if marked so at submission time. The requirements of TOPLAS apply to these submissions. Accepted Journal First papers will appear in the ESOP proceedings as a 3-page extended abstract (excluding bibliography), will be presented at the conference, and published at TOPLAS. ESOP Journal First submissions will be reviewed by the ESOP PC, with an additional review coordinated with TOPLAS. After submission, Journal-First papers will not be allowed to switch to a different paper category; yet the ESOP PC reserves the right to treat a Journal-First submission as a regular ESOP submission, in which case, the paper will be eligible for the Journal-After publication scheme. Journal-After Submissions ========================= Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January at a predefined date after the ESOP notification, and to which all accepted papers may apply. A first light review round will be performed by the ESOP PC, to reach Reject or Revise decisions. Papers with Revise decisions will proceed to a second thorough review round, in which additional reviews will be coordinated with TOPLAS, towards a final Reject or Accept decision. -- [LOGIC] mailing list, provided by DLMPST More information (including information about subscription management) can be found here: http://dlmpst.org/pages/logic-list.php

 Conflict of Interest  
 The program co-chairs are seeking collaboration from authors and PC members to avoid having papers reviewed by individuals with a conflict of interest (CoI). PC members will need to point out possible CoIs during the bidding phase. Meanwhile, authors will be prompted during submission to identify any PC members they have CoIs with and to specify the nature of those CoIs.  
  
 This means a CoI exists if an author and a PC member:  
 are currently affiliated with the same institution; 
  have previously had a supervisor/PhD student dynamic; 
  have co-authored or collaborated in the past two years; 
  have or had a financial tie within the last two years; 
  are related or share a close personal friendship. 
   
 If there are other types of conflicts not listed, authors should reach out to the chairs to discuss and clarify the potential issue.  
  
 PC members, including the program co-chairs, with conflicts of interest related to a submission will not participate in its discussion or review. Additionally, authors are obligated to inform the PC Chairs of any situations or reasons that might compromise or potentially sway professional judgment.  
  
 The chairs hold the authority to seek additional clarification and may choose to dismiss non-critical conflicts based on their judgement.  

 How to submit your paper  
 Papers submitted need to use the LNCS format   from the start. They should be no longer than 16 pages in a 10-point font, not counting references and clearly marked appendices, and should not go over 20 pages in total. While the committee might not read the appendices, the main paper should make sense without them. All papers should be in English.  
  
 Submit your papers to this EasyChair link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esorics2024     
  
 EasyChair - how to Submit     
  
 We are only accepting PDF formats. Your submissions will not be anonymous.   
 If your submission does not follow these rules, it might be rejected without a review. If your paper is accepted, you will need to agree to Springer LNCS copyright terms and make sure your paper is presented at the conference.   

 Paper submissions  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings. Papers that either lack originality, clarity in presentation, fall outside the scope of this call for papers or were already rejected in the first review cycle, might be rejected without a review. Authors will be promptly informed in such cases.  

 Topics of Interest  
  
 We are actively seeking contributions in all realms of computer security. This encompasses a broad spectrum, including but not restricted to:  

 Seeking submissions of premier, novel, and previously unreleased research papers! The Symposium will start on September 16, 2024 with an exciting technical program.

45. Conference ETRA_1:
Submission Process  
  
  Full & Short Papers   
 ETRA 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle the submission and reviewing process: https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=etra  .  
  Please ensure that you are making a submission to Society=ETRA, Conference=ETRA 2025, Track={ETRA 2025 Full Papers, ETRA 2025 Short Papers, etc.}, and choose the respective track. Please create an account if you do not already have one. Edit your submission by including the required information by the respective due date(s). As long as the status of your submission is "incomplete", PCS will provide a note of what information is required by what deadline.  
   
  Please upload a 150-maximum word abstract reflecting your expected contribution by the Paper Abstract due date (mandatory submission). Your abstract submission will allow us to prepare for the review process. An abstract is required before the actual paper is submitted.  
   
  Paper Template  
 We use the ACM article template  for all submissions.  
   
  To prepare your paper for submission, please use the single column format  using the provided Word or LaTeX templates. Therefore, the correct template for submission is: single column Word Submission Template and single column LaTeX (using the “manuscript,review,anonymous” style available in the template). Please use the "author year" citation and reference format.  
   
  Please submit just the PDF version of your manuscript to PCS. When generating the PDF file, please make sure that the fonts are embedded in the PDF file. This will ensure that reviewers can view the paper without problems. Reviewers will review your paper in the single column format.  
   
  Please observe the following page limits in the single-column format  : Full Papers: max. 14 pages (plus any number of additional pages for references), max. 150 words abstract 
  Short Papers: max. 8 pages (plus any number of additional pages for references), max. 150 words abstract 
   
  Submitted papers must be anonymized  for double-blind peer review, i.e., paper submissions must be appropriately anonymized to conceal the authors' identities and institutions. This means that authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document's meta-data (e.g., the 'Authors' field in your word processor's 'Save As' dialog box). Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper is left to the authors' discretion. We do expect that authors leave in citations to their previous work, so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Nonetheless, please avoid phrases such as "In this paper we build on top of our previous work presented in [reference]…" and, instead, use constructions such as "We extend the work presented in [reference]… ". Observe that you are allowed to extend anyone's work, and only the first phrase reveals that you are the author of the previous work.  
   
  Links to Paper Templates:

 Research  
  
 In the last decade, more and more devices (such as mobile phones, smart meters, or RFID cards) have been designed and deployed in order to collect rich information about users and their environment. While primarily targeting to offer tailored services and innovative applications, such data collection inherently also represents a danger to user privacy. Often, sensitive information can be inferred from the data easily, such as users’ whereabouts or fine-grained activity information.  
 In the context of this application domain, our research is primarily focused on the following points:  
 Exploring threats to privacy 
  Increasing the users’ awareness of these threats 
  Developing countermeasures to preserve user privacy 
  Understanding the factors that motivate users to reveal sensitive information 
  Empowering users to protect their privacy by providing innovative and usable methods 
  Our general research interests are privacy, anonymity and pseudonymity, trust and reputation, and usability in computer networks.

 Call For Papers  
 Last updated on June 28, 2024  

 Conflict of Interest  
 The program co-chairs are seeking collaboration from authors and PC members to avoid having papers reviewed by individuals with a conflict of interest (CoI). PC members will need to point out possible CoIs during the bidding phase. Meanwhile, authors will be prompted during submission to identify any PC members they have CoIs with and to specify the nature of those CoIs.  
  
 This means a CoI exists if an author and a PC member:  
 are currently affiliated with the same institution; 
  have previously had a supervisor/PhD student dynamic; 
  have co-authored or collaborated in the past two years; 
  have or had a financial tie within the last two years; 
  are related or share a close personal friendship. 
   
 If there are other types of conflicts not listed, authors should reach out to the chairs to discuss and clarify the potential issue.  
  
 PC members, including the program co-chairs, with conflicts of interest related to a submission will not participate in its discussion or review. Additionally, authors are obligated to inform the PC Chairs of any situations or reasons that might compromise or potentially sway professional judgment.  
  
 The chairs hold the authority to seek additional clarification and may choose to dismiss non-critical conflicts based on their judgement.  

 How to submit your paper  
 Papers submitted need to use the LNCS format   from the start. They should be no longer than 16 pages in a 10-point font, not counting references and clearly marked appendices, and should not go over 20 pages in total. While the committee might not read the appendices, the main paper should make sense without them. All papers should be in English.  
  
 Submit your papers to this EasyChair link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esorics2024     
  
 EasyChair - how to Submit     
  
 We are only accepting PDF formats. Your submissions will not be anonymous.   
 If your submission does not follow these rules, it might be rejected without a review. If your paper is accepted, you will need to agree to Springer LNCS copyright terms and make sure your paper is presented at the conference.   

 Paper submissions  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings. Papers that either lack originality, clarity in presentation, fall outside the scope of this call for papers or were already rejected in the first review cycle, might be rejected without a review. Authors will be promptly informed in such cases.  

 Topics of Interest  
  
 We are actively seeking contributions in all realms of computer security. This encompasses a broad spectrum, including but not restricted to:  

 Seeking submissions of premier, novel, and previously unreleased research papers! The Symposium will start on September 16, 2024 with an exciting technical program.  
 This includes rigorously reviewed papers, keynote addresses and the associated workshops.
