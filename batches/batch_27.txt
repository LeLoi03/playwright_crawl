This is fostered through panel discussions, keynotes, invited talks, and industry exhibits, where academia is exposed to state-of-the-practice and results from trials and interoperability experiments. The industry, in turn, benefits from exposure to leading-edge research as well as an opportunity to communicate and collaborate with academic researchers regarding practical problems. This year the theme is Ubiquitous networking for seamless connectivity. Technical papers are invited which have special focus on enabling technologies that are aligned with the theme of the conference.

 This Special Issue (SI) focuses on microphysiological systems that can be used to characterize, study and experiment natural bio-communications, as well as artificial molecular communication and computing. Microphysiological systems are infrastructure that interconnects a sequence of organs-on-chips or in vitro constructs to enable deep understandings of two- or three-dimensional cellular models. Such systems can facilitate deep understandings of molecular communications not only within homogeneous tissues, but also between different organs. The SI aims to attract submissions on the use of microphysiological system to understand molecular communication, as well as new technologies that can be integrated into microphysiological system to sense communication molecules.  
 We wish to investigate using microphysiological systems that can be used for studying biological intelligence. The concept revolves around using in vitro models to extract natural computing functions and one example is organoid intelligence. This can be used for natural cell models or engineered synthetic systems that lead to new forms of biological computations. This can result in new understanding of how synthetic biology used to engineer biological communications, can lead to new insights for biological intelligence, which can lead to new discoveries for the field of Artificial Intelligence. The SI is also open to using microphysiological systems to understand the underlying principles that control life based on cell communication. The knowledge gained from works on this SI has the potential to lead to revolutionary advancements in a variety of fields, including medicine, environmental science, and information technology.  
 To this end, we invite submissions on the following topics (but are not limited to):  
 Using microphysiological systems to understand natural and engineered bio-molecular communications 
  Advanced design and new technologies for microphysiological systems 
  Integration of AI and machine learning tools with microphysiological system for bio-molecular communications and computing analysis 
  Organoid and biological intelligence 
  Novel applications and paradigms in biological AI 
  AI in imaging and molecular data analysis of bio-molecular communications 
  Ethical and safety considerations of using microphysiological systems for studying bio-molecular communications

 Overview  
 Graphics Interface is the oldest continuously-scheduled conference in computer graphics and human-computer interaction. The conference dates back to 1969, when it was the "Canadian Man-Computer Communications Seminar", changing its name in 1982 to Graphics Interface. Graphics Interface 2020 was the conference's 46th year, and took place from May 28th – 29th, 2020. While the global pandemic forced the conference to assume a virtual format in 2020, the event was free to all to attend with a selection of high quality papers in computer graphics, visualization, and human-computer interaction. Paper presentations were pre-recorded and available on the Graphics Interface YouTube channel and are linked from the Graphics Interface archive.

HOME     
 Green computing, in the context of cloud and pervasive computing, is an emerging research field in computer science and engineering. Pervasive computing and cloud computing are two promising paradigms that have been seeing exponential growth in the deployments and which, poised to take major roles in human's daily life. But in order to realize this potential, both will have to face the critical challenges related to energy consumption, for example, controlling the energy spent by the large-scale cloud data centers and prolonging the battery life of mobile devices in pervasive computing and Internet of Things (IoT). New concepts and technologies such as mobile cloud computing (MCC), software-defined networking (SDN), Edge/Fog and hybrid cloud services can be leveraged to make cloud data centers and pervasive wireless devices more energy efficient. They aid us shape a "green" world in the future.  
   
  The 17th International Conference on Green, Pervasive, and Cloud Computing (GPC 2022) is the next event in a series of highly successful events focusing on pervasive and environmentally sustainable computing. The main conference of GPC 2022 will be held on 2-4 December 2022 at Chengdu, China, and will provide a high-profile, leading-edge forum for scientists, engineers and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences and work-in-process around the Green, Pervasive, and Cloud Computing.  
   
  GPC-2022 will be hosted in Chengdu.

  15th International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experience   
 Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are revolutionizing software development just as automation and componentization revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of abstraction in software specification has been a fundamental goal of the computing community for several decades. Key technologies for automating program development and lifting the abstraction level closer to the problem domain are Generative Programming  for program synthesis, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)  for compact problem-oriented programming notations, and corresponding Implementation Technologies  aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and evolution. As the field matures Applications  and Empirical Results  are of increasing importance.  
 The International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the programming languages research communities.

 Call for Papers  
  
 15th International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experience   
 Topics of Interest   
 GPCE seeks contributions on all topics related to generative software and its properties. As technology is maturing and sophisticated but increasingly complex applications and services are realized in a variety of application areas (e.g., Cloud Computing, Mobile Computing, Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, Software Defined Networking, etc), this year, we are particularly looking for empirical evaluations in this context. Key topics include (but are certainly not limited too):  
 Generative software | Domain-specific languages (language extension, language embedding, language design, language theory, language workbenches, interpreters, compilers) 
  Product lines (domain engineering, feature-oriented and aspect-oriented programming, preprocessors, feature interactions) 
  Metaprogramming (reflection, staging, partial evaluation) 
  Program synthesis 
  Implementation techniques and tool support (components, plug-ins, libraries, metaprogramming, macros, templates, generic programming, run-time code generation, model-driven development, composition tools, code-completion and code-recommendation systems) 
  Practical applications and empirical evaluations | Empirical evaluations | of all topics above (user studies, substantial case studies, controlled experiments, surveys, rigorous measurements) 
  Application areas and engineering practice | (Cloud Computing, Mobile Computing, High Performance Computing, Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, Software Defined Networking, Patterns and Middleware, Reactive Programming, Development methods, etc) 
  Properties of generative software | Correctness of generators and generated code (analysis, testing, formal methods, domain-specific error messages, safety, security) 
  Reuse and evolution 
  Modularity, separation of concerns, understandability, and maintainability 
  Performance engineering, nonfunctional properties (program optimization and parallelization, GPGPUs, multicore, footprint, metrics) 
  We particularly welcome papers that address some of the key challenges in field, for example  
 Synthesizing code from declarative specifications 
  Supporting extensible languages and language embedding 
  Ensuring correctness and other nonfunctional properties of generated code; proving generators correct 
  Improving error reporting with domain-specific error messages 
  Reasoning about generators; handling variability-induced complexity in product lines 
  Providing efficient interpreters and execution languages 
  Human factors in developing and maintaining generators 
  Note on empirical evaluations:  GPCE is committed to the empirical evaluation of generative software and use in practical applications. Publishing empirical papers at programming-language venues can be challenging. We understand the frustration of authors when, for example, reviews simply recommend repeating entire experiments with human subjects with slight deviations in execution. To alleviate such problems, we will recruit program committee experts who routinely work with empirical methods, and we will actively seek external reviews where appropriate. During submissions, authors can optionally indicate that a paper contains substantial empirical work, and we will endeavor to have the paper reviewed by experts familiar with the empirical research methods that are used in the paper. The program committee discussions will reflect on both technical contributions and research methods. For more context, see also Hints for Reviewing Empirical Work in Software Engineering  .  
 Policy:  Incremental improvements over previously published work should have been evaluated through systematic, comparative, empirical, or experimental evaluation. Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’s republication policy ( http://www.sigplan.org  ). Please contact the program chair if you have any questions about how this policy applies to your paper ( chairs@gpce.org  ).  
 Types of Submissions   
 GPCE distinguishes the following types of submissions:  
 Research Papers:   
 Full Papers  reporting original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, or experimental research that contribute to scientific knowledge in the areas listed below (the PC chair can advise on appropriateness). Full paper submissions are limited to 10 pages + 2 extra pages for references. 
  Short Papers  The goal of short papers is to promote current work on research and practice. Short papers represent an early communication of research and do not always require complete results as in the case of a full paper. In this way, authors can introduce new ideas to the community, discuss ideas and get early feedback. Please note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented with a smaller time slot at the conference. Short papers are limited to 4 pages + 1 extra page for references. 
  Tool demonstrations  Tool demonstrations should present tools that implement generative techniques, and are available for use. Any of the GPCE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations, although purely commercial tool demonstrations will not be accepted. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (see above), excluding 1 extra page for references and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 4 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 4-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission. 
  Tech talks:  Depending on whether there is space in the program, GPCE may solicit Tech talks. See the GPCE’15 tech talks call for contributions for details. For now, if you are interested in presenting a Tech talk, please contact the chairs.  
 Workshops:  Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the GPCE audience.  
 When submitting your paper, make sure to indicate the category (research full, research short, tool demonstration paper)

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 Please take a moment to read the instructions below before using the submission site  . When submitting your paper, make sure to indicate the category (research full, research short, tool demonstration paper). Note that camera ready versions will be collected by Conference Publishing Consulting.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  .  
 Format   
 Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format  , 10 point font  , using the font family Times New Roman  . All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the provided ACM SIGPLAN Templates provided here  . Otherwise, follow the author instructions.  
 Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the preprint option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 Full paper submissions are limited to 10 pages + 2 extra pages for references. Short papers and tool demonstrations are limited to 4 pages + 1 extra page for references.  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE  : The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development.  
 More details on the next edition in 2025: https://2025.ecoop.org/track/ecoop-2025-gpce   
 Topics of Interest   
 GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:  
 program transformation, staging, 
  macro systems, preprocessors, 
  program synthesis, 
  code-recommendation systems, 
  domain-specific languages, 
  generative language workbenches, 
  language embedding, language design, 
  domain engineering, 
  software product lines, configurable software, 
  feature interactions, 
  applications and properties of code generation, 
  language implementation, 
  AI/ML techniques for generative programming, 
  generative programming for AI/ML techniques, and 
  low code / no code approaches. 
  GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense. Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope.  
 Paper Categories   
 GPCE solicits four kinds of submissions:  
 Full Papers: reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topic. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography. 
  Short Papers: presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles. 
  Tool Demonstrations: presenting tools for any GPCE topic. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used to evaluate the planned demonstration. 
  (NEW!) Generative Pearl: is an elegant essay about generative programming. Examples include but are not limited to an interesting application of generative programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data structure using generative programming (similar to Functional Pearl in ICFP and Pearl in ECOOP). Accepted Generative Pearl papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Generative Pearl)” appended to their titles. 
  Paper Selection   
 The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:  
 Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field. 
  Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways. 
  Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies. 
  Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly. 
  Best Paper Award   
 Following the tradition, the GPCE program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.  
 Paper Submission   
 Papers must be submitted using HotCRP: https://gpce24.hotcrp.com   
 All submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”. Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files, the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex template and use the document-class \documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}.  
 To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE uses the double-blind review process which has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences:  
 Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers, and references to the authors’ own work should be in the third person. 
  No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors’ identities in implicit ways.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, contact the program chair.  
 ACM Artifact Badges (New!)   
 There as been quite some momentum in recent years to improve replication and reproducibility in software engineering. Starting this year with the 2024 edition, we want to give authors the chance to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge. Even though the artifact submission is not mandatory, we recommend authors to submit their artifacts to reach a higher impact with their research.  
 Authors that want to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge are asked to add a brief paragraph in the ACKs section of their submission. The paragraph should indicate which ACM Badge is the submission aiming for (see ACM page linked below) and what is part of the artifact. The paragraph may be removed for the final version of the paper, if it is clear from the manuscript what constitutes the artifact.  
 The review of artifact badges will not be available during the author rebuttal period and received artifacts will be announced shortly before the camera ready version is due to by authors of accepted submissions only. Hence, artifacts for rejected submissions may not be reviewed at all.  
 More information on ACM Artifact Badges: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current

 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  ECOOP 2025  ( series  ) /  Technical Papers ECOOP 2025   
   
 Call for Papers   
 ECOOP is a conference about programming originally focused on object orientation, but now including all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions.  
 Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:  
 Research. | The most traditional category for papers that advance the state of the art. 
  Replication. | An empirical evaluation that reconstructs a published experiment in a different context in order to validate the results of that earlier work. 
  Experience. | Applications of known PL techniques in practice as well as tools. Industry papers will be reviewed by practitioners. We welcome negative results that may provide inspiration for future research. 
  Pearls/Brave New Ideas. | Articles that either explain a known idea in an elegant way or unconventional papers introducing ideas that may take some time to substantiate. These papers may be short. 
  Submissions   
 Submission must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work. In case of doubt, contact the chairs. Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template  . To reduce friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will be reformatted).  
 ECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the FAQ  . If in doubt, contact the chairs.  
 There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue. Authors also have to consider that the camera-ready version must be (at most) 25 pages  in LIPIcs format (not including references).  
 Authors will be given a three-day period to read and respond to the reviews of their papers before the program committee meeting. Responses have no length limit.  
 ECOOP will continue to have two deadlines for submissions. Papers submitted in each round can be (a) accepted, (b) rejected, or (c) asked for revisions. Rejected papers that are submitted to the immediate next round can be desk-rejected if they do not sufficiently differ from the previous submission. Revisions can be submitted at any later round. Papers retain their reviewers during revision.  
 Review Criteria   
 Each paper will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 Soundness: How well the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods; 
  Significance: The extent to which the paper’s contributions are novel, original, and important, with respect to the existing body of knowledge; 
  Presentation: Whether the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of ECOOP. 
  After author response and reviewer discussion, papers will be accepted if the PC decides that the paper meets our high bar for Soundness and Presentation, and if ONE reviewer judges the paper to meet the bar for Significance. The goal of this process is to ensure quality of writing and confidence in results, while assuming that if one reviewer finds the paper to be significant then there will be readers who do so as well.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Intent   
 To support replication of experiments, authors of research papers may submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. They will be asked whether they intend to submit an artifact at submission time. It is understood that some papers do not have artifacts. AEC members will serve on the extended review committee.  
 Journal First and Journal After   
 We have Journal First/After arrangements with ACM’s Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Elsevier’s Science of Computer Programming (SCP) and AITO’s Journal of Object Technology (JOT).  
 Only new research papers are eligible to be Journal First (JF). JF papers will have an extended abstract in the ECOOP proceedings. The deadline is the same as Round 1 of submissions and the notification is aligned with Round 2 notification. TOPLAS JF papers should be submitted according to this announcement. SCP JF papers should follow this call for papers. JF papers are presented at the conference and eligible for awards.  
 Journal After (JA) papers are papers for which the authors request to be considered for post conference journal publication. Once accepted by the ECOOP PC, these papers will be forwarded to the journal editors. Reviews and reviewers will be forwarded and used at the editor’s discretion. JA papers will have an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) in the conference proceedings.

  Call for Papers 
  The two-day program of GPCE 2022 is over. Thank you very much to all attendees and contributors. The proceedings are available on ACM Digital Library. URL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3564719   
 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the programming languages research communities.  
 Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are revolutionizing software development just as automation and componentization revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of abstraction in software specification has been a fundamental goal of the computing community for several decades. Key technologies for automating program development and lifting the abstraction level closer to the problem domain are Generative Programming for program synthesis, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for compact problem-oriented programming notations, and corresponding Implementation Technologies aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and evolution. As the field matures Applications and Empirical Results are of increasing importance.  
 GPCE 2022 will be co-located with SPLASH, APLAS, DLS, SAS, and SLE. The conference will be hosted in Auckland, New Zealand. Any author who cannot travel is allowed to “Zoom in” during the allocated slot.

 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development.  
 GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:  
 program transformation, staging, macro systems, preprocessors, program synthesis, and code-recommendation systems, 
  domain-specific languages, language embedding, language design, and language workbenches, 
  feature-oriented programming, domain engineering, and feature interactions, 
  applications and properties of code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. 
  GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense.  
 Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope.  
  Paper Categories   
 GPCE solicits three kinds of submissions:  
 Full Papers  reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topics. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography. 
  Short Papers  presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles. 
  Tool Demonstrations  presenting tools for any GPCE topics. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used for evaluating the submission. 
   Paper Selection   
 The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:  
 Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field. 
  Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways. 
  Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies. 
  Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly. 
   Best Paper Award   
 Following the tradition, the GPCE 2022 program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.  
  Paper Submission   
 Papers must be submitted using HotCRP: https://gpce2022.hotcrp.com/   
 All submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  . Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files  , the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex  template and use the document-class \documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}  .  
 To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE 2022 uses the double-blind review process  which has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences:  
 Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers, and 
  references to the authors’ own work should be in the third person. 
  No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors’ identities in implicit ways.  
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, contact the program chair: kameyama (at) acm.org  
  Authors Take Note   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. Papers must describe work not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  . Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism as described by the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  .

 Title: Language Design meets Verifying Compilers  
 Date: December 6th, 2022  
 Abstract: The dream of developing compilers that automatically verify whether programs meet their specifications remains an ongoing challenge.  
 Such ``verifying compilers'' are (finally) on the verge of entering mainstream software development. This is partly due to advancements made over the last few decades but also the increasingly significant and complex role software plays in the modern world. As computer scientists, we should encourage this transition and help relegate many forms of software errors to the history books. One way of increasing adoption is to design languages around these tools, which look, on the surface, like regular programming languages. That is, to seamlessly integrate specification and verification and offer something that, for the everyday programmer, appears as nothing more than glorified type checking. This requires, amongst other things, careful consideration as to which language features mesh well with verification and which do not. The design space here is interesting and subtle but has been largely overlooked. In this talk, I will attempt to shed light on this murky area by contrasting the choices made in two existing languages: Dafny and Whiley.  
   
 Best Paper Award  
   
 The Program Committee of GPCE 2022 has decided to give the GPCE 2022 Best Paper Award to:  
 Type System for Four Delimited Control Operators by Chiaki Ishio and Kenichi Asai (Ochanomizu University).  
 Reviewers’ recommendation: “Type System for Four Delimited Control Operators” introduces a language that incorporates four well-known control operators (shift, control, shift0, control0) with a new unified type system derived from a double-CPS interpreter. The reviewers appreciated the technical depth of the work, the thorough comparison to previous systems, and the well-structured exposition. One particularly impressive aspect of the work is the mechanization of the main theorems in Agda, which lends significant credibility to the results. The system is likely to serve as a useful basis for type systems that support additional control features such as answer-type polymorphism and algebraic effects."  
 Congratulations!  
 Yukiyoshi Kameyama, on behalf of the GPCE2022 Program Committee

 About 
  Program 
  Accepted Papers 
  Several SIGPLAN conferences have been held virtually or in hybrid mode since March 2020.  
 We invite authors of papers from ICFP, OOPSLA, POPL, and PLDI conferences who were previously only able to present their work in a virtual track, to come to Auckland and present their work in person at SPLASH 2022.  
 NB!  Only papers never presented in past SIGPLAN Tracks of the other conferences are eligible.   
 These presentations will be given during the main conference days, in parallel with OOPSLA and Onward! 2022 presentations. They will not be streamed, since they were already streamed at their respective conferences in a virtual track.  
 Registration deadline: October 1st, 2022  
 Registration to present SIGPLAN OOPSLA/Onward!/POPL/PLDI/ICFP covid-affected papers: please fill up this form  .  
 UPDATE:  We are providing the same opportunity to the COVID-affected authors of GPCE, DLS, SAS, and SLE. To register, please fill up this form  .

 The Non-Uniform Distribution of User’s Calls in Time & Space: heterogeneous wireless networks  
 In heterogeneous network environment integrated multiple radio access technology, the nonuniform distribution of users’ calls in time and space is the important factor affecting the performance of heterogeneous wireless network. In order to improve the performance of heterogeneous wireless network, a novel dynamic load balance scheme based on access selection and calls transfer was proposed. In this paper, access selection was modeled as a constrained optimization problem, the access calls was assigned to all base station evenly in accordance with the optimization result. In addition, in order to weaken the destructiveness of sudden calls from hot area to the system load balance, a calls transfer strategy based on the threshold of base station load rate was given. Experimental result shows that the proposed solution performs better than literature solutions in access blocking rate, calls dropping rate, load balance and system utilization rate, and has the advantage of good application value

Note  : Applications for oversubscribed meetings will only be considered by the conference chair if more seats become available due to cancellations.  

 Conference Description  
    
 The Visualization in Science and Education GRC is a premier, international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages. The conference program includes a diverse range of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field. The conference is five days long and held in a remote location to increase the sense of camaraderie and create scientific communities, with lasting collaborations and friendships. In addition to premier talks, the conference has designated time for poster sessions from individuals of all career stages, and afternoon free time and communal meals allow for informal networking opportunities with leaders in the field.  
 The 2025 Gordon Research Conference on Visualization in Science and Education will continue the tradition of bringing together a multi-disciplinary group including researchers from the social and natural sciences, artists, technologists, journalists, educators from formal and informal settings, and others engaged in the production, study, and application of visualizations to advance and promote scientific understanding. The theme for the 2025 conference is “Visualization for Impact,” which is designed to explore an array of transdisciplinary and multi-dimensional topics such as machine learning and visualization, visualization for impact in AR/VR/XR, visualization for action and social good, visualization for education (literacy, activities, pedagogy), visualization of earth and environmental science, and visualization of uncertainty and qualitative data. The conference will explore Visualization for Impact as a means of inspiring change, influencing policies, and informing better and smarter decision-making. The Gordon Research Conference offers an ideal format for examining such topics due to its residential setting and highly collaborative atmosphere that promotes discovery of new intersections between fields. In the 2025 Gordon Research Conference on Visualization in Science and Education, speakers will apply technical, ethical, artistic, scientific, educational and philosophical lenses as to how visualizations can clarify or intensify the uncertainty inherent in natural, engineered, social, and biological data. We will also consider how the mind understands complex data and how visualizations support or obstruct mental models. We will apply the collective wisdom of speakers and participants to understand how visualizations can impact both scientific analysis and public decision making around pressing socio-scientific issues.  

 Related Meeting  

 This GRC will be held in conjunction with the "Visualization in Science and Education" Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). Those interested in attending both meetings must submit an application for the GRS in addition to an application for the GRC. Refer to the associated GRS program page  for more information.  

 Conference Program  
    
 The conference chair is currently developing their preliminary program, which will include 9 sessions and the names of the invited speakers and discussion leaders for each of these sessions. Please check back regularly for updates to this information.

  About GRC 
  Seed Funding for Gordon Research Seminars 

 Seed Funding for Gordon Research Seminars ®   
 More than 80% of Gordon Research Conferences now have a corresponding Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a two-day meeting designed specifically for graduate students, post-doctoral students, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience. At these seminars, which take place immediately prior to the associated GRC, young investigators present and discuss cutting-edge, unpublished research and build collaborative relationships with colleagues and peers in a non-intimidating environment. GRSs are particularly important, however, because they allow the next generation of scientists to network and discuss their research at a critical time in their careers. Ninety-five percent of GRS participants continue on and attend the associated Gordon Research Conference.  
 Kenan Institute for Engineering, Technology, and Science (KIETS) at North Carolina State University  
  The growth of the GRS program was made possible through our continuing partnership with the Kenan Institute for Engineering, Technology, and Science  (KIETS) at North Carolina State University. Since 2001, KIETS has provided limited seed funding for communities hosting their first GRS.  
 The Kenan Institute is dedicated to “encouraging multidisciplinary, multi-institutional teams involving government, university, and corporate partners to solve scientific and societal problems, generate technology-based economic development, and bring together the public and private resources necessary to tackle successfully the emerging issues of our time.” The Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GKRS) funding is highly valued for its contribution to the exponential growth of the GRS program.

 Welcome to GROUP 2025!  
 ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work, a PACM:HCI Affiliated Conference will be held at Omni Hilton Head Oceanfront Resort, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA, January 12-15, 2025.  
 The ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP) is a premier yet intimate and welcoming venue for research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Sociotechnical Studies, Practice-Centered Computing, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, Open Source Software, and related endeavors. Details about the conference organization and attendance are currently work in progress and more information will be provided on demand and on the conference website in the coming months.  
 Key goals for the program are to encourage and facilitate researchers within CSCW, HCI for practice-centered computing, and sociotechnical studies to interact and to present recent research contributions. We also encourage research contributions from interdisciplinary groups to present work that might be difficult to place within one simple category. We are open to diverse and innovative research methods, and to contributions across broad areas such as systems, societies, participation, critique, collaboration, and human interaction. GROUP 2025 in particular would like to encourage cross-disciplinary research across computing, social science, law, and algorithmic systems design, as well as researchers from industry, academia, government, and other interested groups to participate.  
 Our hope is that GROUP 2025 will be held as an in-person, physical event.

 Doctoral Consortium - Call for Participation  
 GROUP 2025 Doctoral Consortium Call  for Participation! (Please circulate to your University Listservs or other spaces where we can work to broaden participation)  
 Important Dates   
 Monday, 23 September 2024, 11:59 pm ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD:  Deadline for submissions  
 Monday, 7 October 2024:  Notification of decision  
 Thursday, 10 October 2024:  Camera-ready due  
 Sunday, 12 January 2025:  Doctoral Consortium  
 Call for Participation   
 The GROUP 2025 Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to discuss their research in an international forum under the guidance of a panel of experienced HCI and CSCW researchers. The Doctoral Consortium will be held on 12 January as part of the ACM 2025 Conference on Supporting Group Work in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA. Selected applicants will be asked to give short, informal presentations during the Consortium. These will be followed by extensive group discussion in a friendly and constructive workshop. Participants will also present their research in an interactive poster session during the main technical program of the conference.  
 We welcome applicants from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform human-centered computing, including anthropology, sociology, information science, computer science, cognitive science, organizational studies, design and related fields. We are particularly interested in applications from institutions and groups that have not traditionally been well-represented at past GROUP conferences.  
 Applicants should be Ph.D. students with an already established direction of research relevant to HCI and CSCW, but whose research would benefit from guidance provided by peers and senior colleagues at the Doctoral Consortium. Preference will be given to students who have a defined topic and program of work, i.e., who have proposed their topics and are within 2 years of graduation within a 5-year program or are half way through a 3 (or 4) year program. Upon the acceptance of your application, registration fees must be paid.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 GROUP 2025 is using the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0. To submit, log in to PCS, click on “Submissions”, and then make a new submission to Group -> Group 2025 -> Group2025 Doctoral Consortium.  
 You will be asked to provide:   
  A FOUR-page overview (including references) of your doctoral research that describes your research question(s), work in progress, and expected contributions. This overview should also include (1) a paragraph that articulates what you hope to gain from attending the GROUP Doctoral Consortium, and (2) an abstract of no more than 100 words. This overview should be single-authored, and no co-authors (including doctoral advisors) should be included.   
 The writeup should be in the single-column ACM Master Article Submission Template. Authors can use their preferred platform to prepare their document, though LaTeX/Overleaf tends to generate the fewest errors. Authors can use the following links to find their preferred template file:  
 Microsoft Word (docx) 
  LaTex zip file | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf | (or search for ACM Conference Proceedings "Master" Template) 
  The writeup should include the author's names and affiliations - these are not anonymous submissions. Authors of accepted doctoral research overview will have their extended abstract published as part of the conference companion which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Supplementary material   
 A short (2-3 paragraph) biographical sketch. 
  Two publications: (1) One publication that best illustrates your research interests + (2) one paper or book that you find most inspiring (perhaps something that you draw on to inform your work, or something that pushed your research in a given direction). 
  A letter from your advisor/supervisor indicating that they support your application to the Consortium and they agree that your research is at an appropriate stage for participation. This letter should also make reference to how you might benefit from the Doctoral Consortium and how they expect that you might benefit the other students in this group experience. The letter should also comment on the availability of financial support for the student's travel to the Doctoral Consortium. See below under "Important Note on Funding." 
  Comments about the availability of funds to attend the Consortium (e.g., complete funds available through the university/research grant, partial funds available, applied for the SIGCHI Student Travel Grant and was awarded, applied for a travel grant but was not awarded, etc.). See below under “Important Note on Funding.” 
  The deadline for submitting is Monday, 23 September 2024, 11:59 pm ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD  . After this date, the system will be closed.  
 All questions should be directed to [email protected]    
 Important Note on Funding   
 We have secured financial support for United States (US)-based participants who are accepted into the 2025 cohort to attend the Doctoral Consortium through the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award No. 2436143. Due to NSF rules, this funding can only be used on US-based Doctoral students. In addition, US-based participants's advisor letter should also describe the availability (of lack thereof) of travel funds for the students from NSF and other funding sources. A backup plan should be provided in case the travel costs are higher than the award amount the student receives. For example, the advisor can show commitment to covering the cost of travel in excess of the travel award will suffice.  
 We strongly encourage students outside of the US to seek funding, such as the Gary Marsden Travel Awards ( https://sigchi.org/resources/gary-marsden-travel-awards  ).

 Application Information  
    
 Applications for this meeting must be submitted by June 14, 2025  . Please apply early, as some meetings become oversubscribed (full) before this deadline. If the meeting is oversubscribed, it will be stated here. Note  : Applications for oversubscribed meetings will only be considered by the conference chair if more seats become available due to cancellations.  
 GRS Speaker Abstract Deadline  : Although applications will be accepted until the date noted above, any applicants who wish to be considered for an oral presentation should submit their application by April 6, 2025  . Please refer to the application instructions in the Conference Description  section below for more details (if available).  

 Conference Description  
    
 The Visualization in Science and Education GRS provides a unique forum for young doctoral and post-doctoral researchers to present their work, discuss new methods, cutting edge ideas, and pre-published data, as well as to build collaborative relationships with their peers. Experienced mentors and trainee moderators will facilitate active participation in scientific discussion to allow all attendees to be engaged participants rather than spectators.  
 As a community, the Visualization in Science and Education GRC is unique in its multidisciplinary  constituency. Together we span research, design, and practice; across a variety of academic disciplines, industries, formal and informal education spaces. In this first associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), early career professionals will have the opportunity to learn from both peers and mentors about how to navigate the processes and pathways of this multidisciplinary milieu.  
 Recognizing that communication and collaboration are key to the success of interdisciplinary projects, we plan to split our session time between: (1) professional development: presentations and panels focusing on skills and career exploration, and (2) cutting edge visualization research and practice. Throughout all presentation, panel and poster sessions, GRS attendees will be active participants, sharing their unique perspectives and innovative ideas.  
 You are an ideal candidate for the 2025 Visualization in Science and Education Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) if you are an early career researcher, designer or practitioner of visualization.  We recognize that the definition of early career may differ between fields, and as we navigate changes in career paths. To maximize the diversity of experiences from which we can learn, we suggest that a period of 5 years  since either: (1) having finished a degree in your area of study, or (2) entering your current career path, be used as a heuristic. We actively invite participation from early career scientists, as well as anyone who creates, studies, or uses visualizations for impact: including journalists, designers, policymakers and science communicators.  If you are interested in attending but are not sure if this GRS is right for you, please reach out to the co-chairs to discuss your interests. The GRS is a great opportunity to present new or in-progress work and cultivate your professional network in a supportive and collaborative environment.  
   
  Note that GRS participants are strongly encouraged to attend both the early career seminar (GRS) as well as the associated GRC (in the days that follow). Applicants must submit an abstract (for a poster presentation), although the same abstract may be submitted to both the GRS and GRC. Unique to Gordon Research Seminars  , invited oral presentations are selected from the submitted poster abstracts. We will prioritize abstracts that align with this year's GRC VSE conference theme: Visualizations for Impact  . If you would like to be considered for an oral presentation, please submit your abstract by March 30, 2025.  If you are interested in contributing to our professional development sessions about career pathways and collaboration skills, please reach out to the GRS co-chairs and make a note in your abstract submission.  
   
  We look forward to seeing you in Maine in July 2025!  
   
 Application Instructions  
 The seminar will feature approximately 10 talks and 2 poster sessions. All attendees are expected to actively participate in the GRS, either by giving an oral presentation or presenting a poster. Therefore, all applications must include an abstract.  
 The seminar chair will select speakers from abstracts submitted by April 6, 2025  . Those applicants who are not chosen for talks and those who apply after the deadline to be considered for an oral presentation will be expected to present a poster. In order to participate, you must submit an application by the date indicated in the Application Information  section above.  
 Program Format  
 Gordon Research Seminars are 2-day meetings which take place on the Saturday and Sunday just prior to the start of the associated GRC. The GRS opens with a 1-hour introductory session on Saturday afternoon, followed by a poster session, dinner and a 2-hour session in the evening. Sunday morning begins with breakfast and is followed by another 2-hour session, a second poster session, and lunch. A final 1-hour session takes place just after lunch, and the associated GRC begins later that evening.  

 Related Meeting  

 This GRS will be held in conjunction with the "Visualization in Science and Education" Gordon Research Conference (GRC). Those interested in attending both meetings must submit an application for the GRC in addition to an application for the GRS. Refer to the associated GRC program page  for more information.  

 Conference Program  
    
 An outline of the program components for this GRS is displayed below. The seminar chair is currently developing their detailed program schedule, which will include the speakers they select from submitted abstracts, in addition to any additional components outlined below. The detailed program will be available by May 13, 2025  . Please check back for updates.

  About GRC 
  Seed Funding for Gordon Research Seminars 

 Seed Funding for Gordon Research Seminars ®   
 More than 80% of Gordon Research Conferences now have a corresponding Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a two-day meeting designed specifically for graduate students, post-doctoral students, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience. At these seminars, which take place immediately prior to the associated GRC, young investigators present and discuss cutting-edge, unpublished research and build collaborative relationships with colleagues and peers in a non-intimidating environment. GRSs are particularly important, however, because they allow the next generation of scientists to network and discuss their research at a critical time in their careers. Ninety-five percent of GRS participants continue on and attend the associated Gordon Research Conference.  
 Kenan Institute for Engineering, Technology, and Science (KIETS) at North Carolina State University  
  The growth of the GRS program was made possible through our continuing partnership with the Kenan Institute for Engineering, Technology, and Science  (KIETS) at North Carolina State University. Since 2001, KIETS has provided limited seed funding for communities hosting their first GRS.  
 The Kenan Institute is dedicated to “encouraging multidisciplinary, multi-institutional teams involving government, university, and corporate partners to solve scientific and societal problems, generate technology-based economic development, and bring together the public and private resources necessary to tackle successfully the emerging issues of our time.” The Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GKRS) funding is highly valued for its contribution to the exponential growth of the GRS program.

 Message from the Special Interest Group Chairs   
 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) provide an opportunity to attract a group of conference attendees who share a common interest and engage them in face-to-face discussions. Organizing a SIG is a great way to start or extend your involvement in the CHI conference program. Several SIGs have evolved into other successful contribution types at subsequent conferences. In addition to interesting, timely and novel SIG topics, we also encourage creative approaches to conducting the SIG itself. While the SIG should provide a structure for discussion, successful SIGs have used exciting approaches to promote lively debate. For instance, previous years formats for the SIG session included a designathon, a reflection exercise, and a sketching group.   
 If you have any doubts regarding SIGs, we welcome you to contact us before submitting your proposal to discuss your ideas for innovative and attractive SIGs!   
   
 ACM’s Publication Policies   
 It is critical that authors review ACM’s publications policies. Please read this separate page  for them.  
   
 What is a Special Interest Group?   
 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) enable conference attendees sharing a common interest to meet informally for 75 minutes of facilitated discussion during a scheduled session at the conference. SIGs offer excellent opportunities for dialog and deliberation on a specific topic. The conference provides each SIG with meeting space and advertises SIG meetings to the rest of the conference in the Extended Abstracts and Conference Program.   
   
 Should I Consider the Workshops, Courses, Special Interest Group, or Panel track?   
 Special Interest Groups enable attendees with a common interest to meet for informal but facilitated discussions during the main conference program. Workshops are meetings of subject matter experts exploring new knowledge. Courses are delivered by expert instructors, typically with established reputations, teaching people who are new to a topic. Panels are interactive, discussion-oriented forums in which audience members are participants in the discussion. See  Courses vs. Workshops vs. SIGs   for more information.   
   
 Preparing and Submitting Your Special Interest Groups Proposal   
 SIG submissions must be submitted via the  PCS Submission System   . The submission must have the following components:   
 SIG Proposal: A 5-page description of the SIG (excluding references), suitable for publication in the | ACM Master Article Submission Templates | (single column). 
  Supplementary Material (also mandatory) using the same template and up to 2-pages. | A brief description of the community (or communities) to which this SIG would be of interest and why it is of interest. 
  Assumed attendee background. 
  The approach you will use for organizing and presenting the SIG. 
  An informal schedule of discussion topics. 
  Your plan to attract a reasonable number of attendees. 
  Which organizer should serve as the primary contact. 
  While not strictly required, we prefer that proposals be authored by a minimum of two individuals representing at least two different organizations. We also encourage prospective SIG organizers to examine examples of accepted SIG abstracts from recent CHI conferences, which are listed below:   
 CHI 2023: Human-Centered Responsible Artificial Intelligence: Current & Future Trends | https://doi.org/10.1145/3544549.3583178 
  CHI 2023: Games and Play SIG: Connecting Through Social and Playful Technologies | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3583176 
  CHI 2023: Reflecting on Hybrid Events: Learning from a Year of Hybrid Experiences | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3583181 
  CHI 2021: Queer in HCI: Strengthening the Community of LGBTQIA+ Researchers and Research | https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3450403 
  CHI 2021: Creative Immersive AI: Emerging Challenges and Opportunities for Creative Applications of AI in Immersive Media | https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3450399 
  CHI 2021: Physiological I/O | https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3450407 
  Authors are strongly encouraged to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions, using recommendations found in the  Guide to an Accessible Submission   . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at  accessibility@chi2025.acm.org  .   
   
 Metadata Integrity   
 All submission metadata, including required fields in PCS like author names, affiliations, and order, must be complete and correct by the submission deadline. This information is crucial to the integrity of the review process and  author representation   . The submission deadline is a hard deadline for listing all  author names  ; there are  no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only during the Publication-Ready submission phase. Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the Publication-Ready submission phase.   
   
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models   
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for  purposes beyond editing the author’s own text.  Please carefully review the April 2023  ACM Policy on Authorship   before you use these tools. The  SIGCHI blog post   describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and  desk reject  papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.   
   
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regards to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on  research involving humans   before submitting.   
   
 Accessibility   
 Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. Authors are expected to follow  SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission   . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at  accessibility@chi2025.acm.org  early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests).   
   
 Selection Process   
 Submissions are  Reviewed   ; although the process is highly selective, it does not necessarily follow a reviewing process by a committee, and authors should not expect to receive formal feedback on their submission other than the selection decision.   
 We consider the following criteria, in descending order of priority:   
 Appeal to the community: | Is the topic both timely and of wide enough appeal to attract a significant audience? At the same time, is the topic sufficiently focused to allow for productive discussion during the SIG meeting? Too narrow, and the SIG might attract too few people; too broad, and it is difficult for progress to be made in the relatively short duration of a SIG. 
  Format: | Is the proposed format conducive to discussion and shared insight? Will it be possible to achieve its aims? SIGs are not workshops, nor project showcases, nor tutorials. 
  Diversity of perspective: | It helps to be able to show that the SIG will be able to encompass a wide perspective, and that the organizers can accommodate and facilitate discussion across this breadth. Places to show this are in the description of the intended community, the assumed attendee background, and the home institutions and disciplines of the organizers. 
  Continuity: | Does the SIG support the development of a longer term interest group, for example follow-on SIGs or other types of contributions at subsequent CHI and other conferences, or a SIGCHI Community? If the topic is a very recent or new one, or a revival of an old topic, then arguments will need to be made, to demonstrate that it is a topic that will persist, rather than simply being this year’s fashion. If the topic is a continuation of previous SIG(s), then it is necessary to present the latest developments of the topic and their projection into the future. 
  Submissions should not contain sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time. Submissions should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference, with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference.   
   
 Upon Acceptance of Your Submission   
 The corresponding author of a conditionally accepted paper has to follow the  instructions   (link tba) on preparing and submitting a final version by the Publication-Ready Deadline. If the authors cannot meet these requirements by the Publication-Ready deadline, the venue chairs will be notified and may be required to remove the paper from the program. The publication-ready version has to follow the LaTeX and Word templates from ACM. Should you need technical assistance, please direct your technical query to: publications@chi2025.acm.org   .   
   
 At the Conference   
 Accepted SIGs will have a scheduled session at the conference. After your SIG is accepted, we will notify you what technical support will be available. Rooms will be set up to facilitate discussion.   
 Note that all SIGs are fully in-person only. In case none of the SIG organizers becomes unable to attend the conference in person due to unavoidable reasons (e.g., visa denial), please contact the SIG chairs at sigs@chi2025.acm.org  .   
   
 After the Conference   
 After the conference, the organizers are encouraged to continue their SIG by organizing a workshop at a future conference or creating and maintaining a website. Accepted SIG proposals will be published in CHI Conference Extended Abstracts in the  ACM Digital Library   .

 Papers  
 You must submit the abstract/metadata by the 5th Sept AoE in order to submit the full paper by the 12th Sept AoE.   
   
 Please submit papers through the Precision Conference Submission Portal    
   
 CHI 2025 papers will follow the same revise & resubmit process from CHI 2024. Authors can read more about the rationale behind CHI 2024’s updates in this post by the CHI 2024 Papers Chairs  .  
   
 Important Facts   
 Revise and Resubmit: | CHI 2025 Papers will continue with a revise and resubmit phase for papers above a certain threshold, where authors have the opportunity to respond to reviewer feedback and improve their paper as part of our | review cycle | . 
  Paper Length: | Concise and succinct writing are strongly encouraged. | There are two paper length categories. The paper length should be counted excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. 
  Short Papers: | Submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
  Standard-Length Papers: | Submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words (about 7,000-8,000 words on average). 
  Submissions with Excessive Length: Submissions of more than 12,000 words will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. | In a very exceptional case, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear strong justification for why submissions are required to be more than 12,000 words. 
  A paper must be stand alone. | All important information to understand the contributions of their work must be in the main paper excluding appendices, videos, and supplemental materials. Reviewers/ACs expect the relevant details to be in the main text of the paper itself. Any extra materials helpful for understanding the work but not necessary (e.g., interview script, coding, additional results, etc.) may be added as an appendix at the end of the main paper, but note that reviewers/ACs are | NOT | required to read the appendices and supplementary materials for review. 
  Accessibility: | Paper submissions are expected to follow the | SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission | . 
  Inclusivity: | Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible. 
  Mandatory Video Presentation: | All accepted authors are required to upload a video presentation by the video presentation deadline, | Thursday, March 13, 2025 | . Note that this deadline for submitting a video presentation is earlier than in 2024. 
  No Video Previews: | Unlike previous years, CHI 2025 has decided NOT to collect video previews (30-second videos to show the core idea of your work), and authors do not need to prepare them. 
    
 Important Dates   
 All times are in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone. When the deadline is day D  , the last time to submit is when D  ends AoE. Check your local time in AoE.

 ACM Selection Process Category   
 Refereed   
   
 Introduction   
 CHI Papers present excellent original research from all areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). CHI Papers are read and cited worldwide and have a broad impact on the development of HCI theory, method, and practice.  
 Authors must  present accepted papers at the CHI Conference either in person or virtually. Accepted manuscripts appear in the Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  , which appears in the ACM Digital Library  . The ACM supports Gold and Green open access options  , and the papers by corresponding authors from ACM Open  institutions will be published as Gold Open Access.  
 Accepted papers may come from any area of HCI activity: academia or industry; science, engineering, or craft; analysis or design. Acceptance is highly competitive: accepted papers will excel in originality, significance, validity, research quality, and presentation clarity. We are looking forward to seeing your best work!  
   
 ACM’s Publication Policies   
 It is critical that authors review ACM’s publications policies. Please read this separate page  for them.  
   
 Metadata Integrity   
 The abstract/metadata deadline is a hard deadline for listing all author names  ; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only during the Publication-Ready submission phase. The abstract/metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the abstract/metadata deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.   
 Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
   
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models   
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text  . Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject  papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
   
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regards to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
   
 Preparing and Submitting Your Paper   
 Step 1. Write Your Paper   
 Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you make multiple submissions to CHI 2025 Papers, they must be distinct from each other. Please refer to the | Guide to a Successful Paper Submission | . 
  Please ensure that you use the correct | template | ; a single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase. | Use of different templates or formats may result in desk rejection. 
  Your submission must be anonymized; please ensure that your submission conforms to the | Anonymization Policy | . | Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. 
  Concise and succinct writing are strongly encouraged in any submission. | Short submissions with a length of 5,000 words or less are strongly welcomed. These papers will go through exactly the same review process although reviewers will be encouraged to ensure that evaluation expectations are commensurate with length and contribution size. 
  Authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of CHI papers is approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words (two standard deviations above the average) will be desk rejected, except in circumstances where the authors are able to provide a strong justification. Authors may contact the relevant subcommittee chairs for guidance on appropriate justification. Submissions that are clearly not complete research papers (e.g., abstracts, work-in-progress, entire theses, extensive journal articles) will be desk rejected. | Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contributions, will be desk rejected. 
  Your paper must be stand alone. | You may use appendices and/or supplementary materials to share additional information about your work, but all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection. 
  If you have any concurrent submissions to CHI or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. | Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. | The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on work currently under review at other venues. Please see | ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions | . 
  Research Quality: Papers must include enough detail that the research can be reviewed for research quality, given the norms and expectations of the relevant subcommittee (e.g., design papers will be judged as rigorous according to the expectations of the design community, not by the expectations of the computational interaction community). Papers that do not include enough detail to adequately assess research quality may be rejected; | papers that are clearly not situated in relevant research literature may be desk rejected. 
  Reproducibility: Where relevant, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible. Please refer to the requirements for supplementary materials below. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. Authors are expected to follow | SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission | . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at | accessibility@chi2025.acm.org | early | in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will have to be reassigned. Note that subcommittees strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – | the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission. 
  Inclusivity: Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible; where this is not possible, it should be acknowledged. For example, authors should use gender-inclusive language when developing their papers (see e.g., | HCI Guidelines for Gender Equity and Inclusivity | ) and consider what communities their work is – and is not – supporting, as well as their geographical context. 
  Questions regarding the submission templates can be addressed by the Publications Chairs at | publications@chi2025.acm.org | . All additional questions regarding the paper submissions process should be directed to the Papers Chairs at | papers@chi2025.acm.org | . 
  Step 2. Prepare Supplementary Materials (Optional)   
 All video figures and supplementary material must be anonymized. Non-anonymized supplemental materials will result in desk rejection of the entire submission. 
  Video figures (optional) do not have a specified time limit for the duration, although we recommend staying within 5 minutes. Details are available in the | Guide to Submitting a Video | . 
  Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help reviewers assess your work as well as allow other researchers to replicate your work. Any non-video supplementary material should be submitted as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. 
  Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main submission file. That is, the paper submission must stand on its own without the supplementary material. 
  Step 3. Select a Subcommittee   
 CHI 2025 expects to receive over 4,000 submissions, as it did in 2024. In order to provide high-quality reviews by experts for all submissions, the CHI program committee is divided into topical subcommittees  . When you submit a paper, you can state a preference of up to two subcommittees whose mandates you believe your topic fits into. It is your responsibility to select the subcommittees that offer the best expertise to assess your research, and that you believe will most fully appreciate your contribution. If you are unsure, you can email the subcommittee chairs for advice. The program committee may re-assign submissions to a different subcommittee if neither of the subcommittees selected by the authors possesses adequate expertise in the submission’s topic.  
 Step 4. Complete Submission   
 Make your submission. Authors may submit and edit their materials via | Precision Conference Submission Portal | until the deadlines. The submission system will open for submissions approximately four weeks before the abstract/metadata submission deadline. 
  Abstract/Metadata Submission Deadline: | Authors must submit their title, abstract (150 words max), list of authors, subcommittee selections, and other metadata before this deadline. Only the contact author can edit the submission files. | No new submissions will be allowed after this deadline. Placeholder metadata (e.g. ‘abstract todo’) are not acceptable and will be desk rejected. 
  Listed authors cannot be changed after the abstract/metadata deadline. | No new authors can be added even during the revise and resubmit period or for the camera-ready version. Making changes to the author list can be used to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper, can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers, and can be used to unethical publication practices. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors | including yourself | , and b) that your PCS account email address is valid. | There are no exceptions. 
  Main Paper Deadline: | Authors must submit the pdf of their paper, and related form data, before this deadline. No extensions will be granted. Any submissions showing ‘incomplete’ after the deadline will be deleted. 
  Video and Supplementary Material Deadline: | As described above, authors can submit optional video figures and any other optional supplementary materials before the deadline. 
  Details on the review process itself are described in the Papers Review Process  .  
   
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper   
 Contact authors of accepted papers will receive instructions  (link tba) on how to prepare and submit a final version by the Publication-Ready Deadline. If the authors are unable to meet these requirements by the Publication-Ready deadline, the Papers Chairs will be notified and may be required to remove the paper from the program. For any issues relating to the publication phase, please contact publications@chi2025.acm.org  .  
 The publication-ready version has to follow the LaTeX and Word templates from ACM. Should you need technical assistance, please direct your technical query to publications@chi2025.acm.org  .  
 Authors will also be required to assign either copyright or license to the ACM or to pay a fee to ACM for Open Access (details about ACM rights management: http://authors.acm.org  , and about the ACM Author-Izer service: http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service  ). Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the CHI conference.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.  
   
 Video Presentations   
 All accepted authors are required to upload a video presentation (a presentation video of your accepted work) by the video presentation deadline of Thursday March 13, 2025.  See technical requirements for video content at CHI  as a guidance for preparing a video presentation. Accepted authors will receive the details of video presentations separately.  
 If authors fail to submit their video presentations by the deadline, their accepted work would be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library.  
 Unlike previous years, CHI 2025 has decided NOT to collect video previews (30-second videos to show the core idea of your work), and authors do not need to prepare them.  
   
 Your Paper at the Conference   
 Authors of accepted papers are required to present their work at CHI 2025, and the presenting author must register for their paper presentations. Those who cannot attend in-person will have the option to present virtually with a virtual registration rate. Further instructions regarding the presentation of the work will be shared closer to the conference dates. If authors fail to participate in presenting their work, their accepted work would be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library.  
   
 Your Paper After the Conference   
 Accepted papers will be distributed in the CHI Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. Video presentations of accepted papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.

 The biennial ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP)  , supported by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (ACM SIGHCI), formerly the ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP), the Conference on Organizational Computing Systems (COOCS), and the ACM SIGOIS (and IEEE CS TC-OA) Conference on Office Information Systems (COCS), is a premier venue for research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and Socio-Technical Studies. A strong emphasis of GROUP conferences is to foster a discourse on collaborative technology that bridges the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Information Systems (IS), Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), and “Learning at the workplace” (CSCL@Work). Relevant issues include the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and impact of these systems as well as examinations of relevant research methodologies. The conference integrates work in social science, computer science, engineering, design, values, and other diverse topics related to group work, broadly conceptualized.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 Overview  
  
 In recent years anthropomorphic, mechanic and pet-like agents have spread globally, which allows various types of ordinary end user to interact with them. Although interaction design for robots and software agents has been investigated in different research fields, few studies were done on the subject for various agents in a unified aspect.  
 HAI (Human-Agent Interaction) is a novel research field to investigate and develop interaction design methods across conventional interactive platforms including robots, software agents and human-human communication through digital media. In HAI, mixtures of interactions of these platforms (human-robot, human-software agent, and human-human through agents) are studied. We aim to collect ideas of and clarify the common design policies through these interactions to further generate and develop HAI design methods based-on knowledge obtained from state of the art research and studies presented in this conference.

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series dedicated to exploring AI systems that work collaboratively, proactively, and purposefully alongside humans, enhancing rather than replacing human intelligence. The goal of HHAI is to develop AI systems that complement human abilities, highlighting the importance of adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive, and human-centered intelligence. These systems leverage human strengths and compensate for weaknesses, while also considering social, ethical, and legal implications.  
 The fourth HHAI conference will take place from June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy.   
 Though the HHAI field is propelled by advances in AI, it requires fundamentally innovative approaches and solutions. We encourage collaboration across various research areas such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy, ethics, and complex systems. For this fourth international conference, we invite researchers from these fields to submit their best original or ongoing work, as well as forward-looking ideas, on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI 2025)    

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series that focuses on the study of Artificial Intelligence systems that cooperate synergistically, proactively and purposefully with humans, amplifying instead of replacing human intelligence. HHAI aims for AI systems that work together with humans, emphasizing the need for adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems. HHAI systems leverage human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses, while taking into account social, ethical and legal considerations.  
 HHAI 2025 will be held on June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy, and is the fourth conference in the series.   
 The HHAI field is driven by developments in AI, but it also requires fundamentally new approaches and solutions. Thus, we encourage collaborations across research domains such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy and ethics, complex systems, and others. In this fourth international conference, we invite scholars from these fields to submit their best original – new as well as in progress – works, and visionary ideas on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 Admission Requirements  
 Introduction to Programming (course).  
 Without having passed this course, participation is not  possible.  
 Description  
 Robots and other intelligent agents are playing an increasing role in our society. Think about chatbots, telephone bots, robots in education at school, and robots in airports or restaurants, and even elderly with dementia. Some of these technologies even serve a social function for example as companions. But how do you actually program or script human-agent interaction (HAI)? How do you ensure a pleasant dialogue? How do you respond to a human? How do you measure what a human thinks, and how do you do it in a smart way so that the human doesn't find it annoying? Often, developing a pleasant interaction means dealing with different AI techniques, all of which are powerfull but not perfect. Further, novel techniques such as LLMs and TTS change the way we interact with AI rapidly. In this course, you will learn how to shape and program the interaction between humans and intelligent agent by making use of AI techniques,copnversational principles, and different modalities, and you learn how to evaluate your design using test subjects using an appropriate experimental setup.  
 Recommended prior knowledge:   
 Human cognition (Course: Intro Cognitive Science) 
  Programming, Python, (Course: Introduction to programming) 
  Course Objectives  
 Remember and understand the different theoretical concepts underlying Human agent interaction 
  Apply these theoretical concepts in the design of in interactive agent 
  Implement the design using suitable technology including but not limited to social robots, chat bots, virtual agents, TTS, STT, computer vision, etc... 
  Analyse and evaluate the implemented design using an appropriate experimental setup with human test subjects. 
  Collaborate as a group.

39. Conference HASKELL_0:
The Haskell Symposium |  
  
   The Haskell  Symposium is an annual symposium organized in affiliation with the International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP  ). The symposium is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ).  
 Scope  
 The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experience with Haskell, and future developments for the language. The scope of the symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, implementation and teaching of Haskell.  
 Past Haskell Workshops and Symposia  
 Before 2008, the Haskell Symposium was known as the Haskell Workshop. The name change reflects the steady increase of influence of the Haskell Workshop on the wider community, as well as an increasing numbers of high quality submissions making the acceptance process highly competitive. Starting in 2019, the Haskell Implementors' Workshop  has been orchestrated by the Haskell Symposium steering committee, while remaining a distinct event.

  Xu hướng công nghệ 2025: bùng nổ phát triển AI Agents  
 pv -  Thứ ba, ngày 03/12/2024 09:00 GMT+7   

 VTV.vn - AI Agents với khả năng hoạt động chủ động, ứng biến các tình huống linh hoạt, đang trở thành xu thế mới tạo đột phá trong năng suất lao động của doanh nghiệp.  
 Trong tương lai, những người đồng nghiệp AI có thể giúp thay đổi cách chúng ta đưa ra quyết định và thậm chí cả cách chúng ta tương tác.  
 AI Agents là gì?   
 AI Agents (tạm dịch: nhân sự AI) là một loại hệ thống trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) có khả năng hiểu và phản hồi các yêu cầu của khách hàng mà không cần sự can thiệp của con người. Chúng được tạo ra dựa vào công nghệ học máy (machine learning) và công nghệ xử lý ngôn ngữ tự nhiên (NLP) để thực hiện nhiều nhiệm vụ khác nhau. Các AI Agents này có thể thực hiện từ việc trả lời câu hỏi đơn giản đến giải quyết các vấn đề phức tạp — thậm chí làm nhiều việc cùng lúc. Quan trọng nhất, các nhân sự AI này có thể tự cải thiện hiệu suất thông qua việc tự học. Điều này khác biệt với AI truyền thống, vốn cần sự can thiệp của con người để thực hiện các nhiệm vụ cụ thể.  
 Một hệ thống AI Agents sẽ sở hữu khả năng đặc trưng như tự chủ, lập luận, học tăng cường, hiểu ngôn ngữ và tuân theo các chỉ dẫn phức tạp, tối ưu hóa quy trình làm việc.  
 Xây dựng đội ngũ AI Agents là một trong những xu hướng công nghệ nổi bật trong năm 2025   
 Theo Gartner, Nhân sự AI đứng đầu trong danh sách xu hướng công nghệ chiến lược vào năm sau. Tổ chức này cũng dự đoán đến năm 2028, ít nhất 15% các quyết định công việc hàng ngày sẽ được thực hiện tự động bởi AI Agents. Bên cạnh đó, báo cáo của Insider cũng cho thấy thị trường AI Agents được định giá lên đến 3,7 tỷ USD vào năm 2023 và dự kiến sẽ đạt 103,6 tỷ USD vào năm 2032, với tỷ lệ tăng trưởng kép hàng năm (CAGR) là 44,9% (giai đoạn 2024 đến 2032).  
 Giá trị mà các AI Agents có thể mang lại cho doanh nghiệp nằm ở khả năng tự động hóa một loạt các trường hợp sử dụng phức tạp, giúp tiết kiệm chi phí hoặc thời gian. Các nghiệp vụ phổ biến được hỗ trợ bởi AI Agents có thể kể đến như: phát triển phần mềm, hỗ trợ khách hàng tự động, vận hành doanh nghiệp, an ninh mạng & phát hiện rủi ro,..  
 Trên thế giới đã có nhiều doanh nghiệp bắt đầu khai phá năng lực của các AI Agents, trong đó Lenovo. Doanh nghiệp này đã tận dụng hệ thống các Nhân sự AI để kết kết nối nhiều ứng dụng nhằm cải tiến quy trình cấu hình sản phẩm, nâng cao hiệu quả tổng thể và tăng sự hài lòng của khách hàng.  
 Lenovo đã thiết lập một hệ thống AI Agents nhằm đơn giản hóa quá trình tạo ra các gợi ý sản phẩm. Đầu tiên, đội ngũ Lenovo xây dựng một cơ sở dữ liệu tri thức được thu thập từ dữ liệu mua hàng, chi tiết sản phẩm, chiến lược marketing và hồ sơ khách hàng. Sau khi có dữ liệu, hệ thống AI Agents được tích hợp với nhiều hệ thống của Lenovo ví dụ như bộ công cụ kiểm tra chính sách cập nhật, mức tồn kho, v.v. Cuối cùng là áp dụng khung LangGraph để cho phép các nhân sự AI khác nhau làm việc cùng nhau, cải thiện hiệu quả và độ chính xác của các gợi ý.  
 AI Agents giúp Lenovo giảm thời gian thiết lập trung bình từ 12 phút xuống còn 2 phút, dẫn đến sự cải thiện hiệu quả công việc của đội ngũ bán hàng. Do đó cũng cải thiện trải nghiệm khách hàng, tỷ lệ đơn hàng đáp ứng KPI giao hàng trong vòng 17 ngày đã tăng 12%.  
 Theo tính toán của Gartner, việc triển khai đội ngũ AI Agents giúp Lenovo tạo ra giá trị tương đương 5,88 triệu USD trong một năm.  
   
 Triển vọng thị trường AI tại Việt Nam khi phát triển các AI Agents   
 Theo Tập đoàn tư vấn toàn cầu IMARC, thị trường AI tại Việt Nam đã đạt giá trị 547,1 triệu USD vào năm 2023 và dự kiến sẽ tăng vọt lên 2,06 tỷ USD vào năm 2032, tương ứng với tỷ lệ tăng trưởng hàng năm kép (CAGR) là 15,8%.  
 Các ông lớn công nghệ Việt đã và đang "mạnh tay" đầu tư cho cuộc chiến phát triển AI Agents. Điển hình như tập đoàn FPT đã công bố ra mắt hai nhà máy AI (FPT AI Factory) tại Nhật Bản và Việt Nam trong tháng 11 vừa qua. Bên cạnh đó, FPT Smart Cloud (thuộc tập đoàn FPT) cũng đã giới thiệu FPT AI Agents - Nền tảng tạo lập và vận hành AI Agents đa ngôn ngữ, bao gồm: Tiếng Anh, Tiếng Việt, Tiếng Nhật và Tiếng Indonesia.

 Với bước tiến công nghệ này, mỗi doanh nghiệp có thể tạo lập AI của riêng mình chỉ trong vài phút hoặc vài giờ. Đặc biệt, đội ngũ AI Agents mang cá tính riêng và sở hữu sự khác biệt, bởi lẽ, các AI Agents được tạo nên dựa trên đầu vào là Dữ liệu, Tri thức và Văn hóa đặc thù của từng tổ chức. Từ đó kiến tạo một giá trị cạnh tranh hoàn toàn mới giữa các doanh nghiệp, và rộng hơn là hành trình xây dựng chủ quyền AI giữa các quốc gia.  
 Được xây dựng trên hạ tầng mạnh mẽ của FPT AI Factory, FPT AI Agents hứa hẹn mang lại bước nhảy vọt về hiệu suất vận hành, kiến tạo trải nghiệm khách hàng vượt trội và thúc đẩy sáng tạo không giới hạn cho mọi doanh nghiệp.

  Introduction  
 The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024) combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both, our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way.  
 HAIS Series of Conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 Identification and Behavior Pattern Recognition of Cows in Intensive and Extensive Farms Using Intelligent Collars and Dimensional Reduction Techniques  
  Abstract   
 The Spanish livestock sector plays a key role in European agricultural production, recently benefiting from investments in advanced technologies to optimize the management and sustainability of the sector. This research work focuses on the analysis of animal behavior, using smart monitoring collars to collect data from dairy cows in intensive and extensive farms. Using dimensional reduction techniques such as PCA, Isomap and t-SNE, this paper compares behavioral patterns between both kinds of farms. The main goal is to identify significant differences in behavior that may influence animal health and efficiency. The results indicate that these techniques can effectively discern between behaviors under different management regimes, which is essential for the implementation of future intelligent models to aid in the early detection of abnormal events such as disease or reproductive changes.he ability to characterize and differentiate these behaviors underscores the importance of advanced data analysis techniques in the continuous improvement of livestock management, aligning production with more sustainable and responsible practices.

 A Supervised Clustering Approach for Subrole Discovery in a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Game  
  Abstract   
 The video game industry, particularly electronic sports, has experienced significant growth, with League of Legends emerging as a leading Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. Success in professional matches heavily depends on strategic character selection during the draft phase. This paper uses data mining to identify and group similar characters’ play styles in professional League of Legends games. The proposed method refines traditional game roles into specific categories based on actual gameplay. The solution combines feature engineering, supervised classification, latent feature extraction with Shapley Additive Explanations, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Results show that this approach performs better than traditional clustering methods, as indicated by higher silhouette indices and meaningful cluster distinctions. The solution aims to provide insights into character usage and potential replacements during drafts.

 Evaluating the Privacy and Security Implications of AI-Based Medical Chatbots on Android Platforms  
  Abstract   
 The rapid expansion of mobile apps on Android platforms, particularly AI-based medical chatbots, presents both remarkable opportunities and significant privacy challenges within the healthcare sector. This paper explores the complex privacy issues arising from the use of such chatbots, focusing on the sensitive nature of health information exchange. We critically assess the effectiveness of current dynamic analysis techniques and the limitations they face in addressing the unique privacy concerns associated with medical chatbots, including third-party integration, encryption of user interactions, and data sharing practices. Our research introduces a novel methodology that employs network packet capture and analysis, using the HTTP Toolkit to scrutinize data traffic between mobile apps and servers in real-time. Through the detailed examination of HAR files and the incorporation of ChatGPT 4.0, our study provides insights into the web interactions and data handling processes of AI-based medical chatbots.

 A Graph Data Model Creation Methodology for Accident Hotspot Prediction in Urban Areas  
  Abstract   
 Reducing road accidents remains a paramount concern worldwide, given their profound impact on public safety and well-being. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for creating a labelled graph data model to predict accident hotspots in urban areas, leveraging accident and road network infrastructure data. The proposed methodology focuses on the creation of a labelled graph where intersections serve as nodes and road segments as arcs by associating accident data with intersections. In order to demonstrate the usability of the proposed methodology, experiments are conducted using simple Machine Learning models to predict accident hotspots, which serve to identify high-risk areas.

 A New Ensemble with Partition Size Variation Applied to Wind Speed Time Series  
  Abstract   
 Wind speed time series exhibit complex patterns, thus integrating wind energy into the electrical system is challenging. This requires specialized skills for operations and planning practices. Training expert predictors on different parts of the time series enables the identification of complex local patterns. However, the partitioning procedure reduces the number of training instances. So, investigating the size of training partitions for an ensemble is desirable for predicting wind speed. Therefore, this paper proposes a homogeneous ensemble for local pattern recognition denoted as LocPart, that varies in partition size. The results of the Diebold-Mariano hypothesis test show promise for the LocPart method applied to three wind speed time series. The comparison was made relative to individual and bagging methods that use a global mapping of the respective base model of the proposal. The LocPart method with LSTM, ARIMA, and ELM base models won in 100%, 83%, and 50% of the cases, respectively.

 BatNoiseDL: Discrimination of Bat Signals Through an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models  
  Abstract   
 Wind energy has become a key driver of economic growth in Spain, as evidenced by the growing number of wind farms, with approximately 22,000 wind turbines spread across 1,500 installations. Despite its benefits, the proliferation of wind farms poses a substantial threat to bat populations as it is estimated that, in Spain alone, one million bats per year may fall victim to the blades of these turbines. Current methods of monitoring bat populations involve laborious analysis of huge ultrasonic data sets, which poses a significant challenge due to the diversity of bat species, background noise, and the different characteristics of their calls. To address this problem, this work proposes the development of deep learning models capable of accurately discerning bat calls from ambient noise. More than 150 models were evaluated, incorporating various neural network architectures and combinations of hyper-parameters. The five best models were selected to form an ensemble, called BatNoiseDL  , which achieved an accuracy rate of \(97.1\%\)  on 500 difficult audio files where bat identification was especially challenging due to high noise levels. In addition, BatNoiseDL  doubled the prediction improvement over three popular commercial tools on an audio sample of 5618 where these tools failed in a high percentage of cases. Therefore, comparative analysis with existing software tools highlighted the superior filtering capability and efficiency of the proposed method against them. The potential of this method is not only accuracy, but also speed improvement through the use of dedicated GPU servers.

 Missing Meteorological Data Imputation for Mini Eolic Electrical Power Prediction  
  Abstract   
 The continuous rising trend shown by greenhouse emissions has led to a global situation in which the promotion of clean alternative technologies is crucial. In this context, small green power self-consumption installations represent an effective and clean solution to reduce climate change. However, they must be subjected to exhaustive supervision of the process, from mechanical, electrical, or electronic components, to ensure good performance and economic feasibility. This work proposes different data imputation techniques to deal with missing data derived from sensor missreadings in a minieolic installation. The performance of regression techniques over each reconstructed set is evaluated with successful results.

 Characterization of Water Consumers in Urban Areas Based on Data Visualization Techniques  
  Abstract   
 The current growth in population density has increased the demand for potable water and aggravated water scarcity in reservoirs, especially in urban and metropolitan areas. This problem, coupled with other aspects such as climate change and rain irregularity, has proven that current water management techniques, which rely on human operator knowledge, are insufficient and inefficient. Observing the development of Data Science and Machine Learning techniques, these intelligent algorithms seem to be an interesting approach that could support water management operations by predicting water usage depending on several factors. A first step involves characterizing user consumption behaviors by applying feature extraction and data visualization techniques to discover similarities and common patterns among users.

 GenAI-Powered Analysis of GIS App Privacy Policies for GDPR Compliance  
  Abstract   
 This paper presents an AI-based analysis of privacy policies in geographic information systems applications (called GIS apps) on the Android platform, with a focus on compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The study utilizes the GenAI - ChatGPT model to examine the linguistic and structural aspects of privacy policies, identifying their adherence to or deviation from GDPR Article 5 principles. Unlike previous research, which predominantly focused on the technical compliance of mobile applications, this study delves into the qualitative assessment of privacy policies, evaluating their clarity and compliance. The research reveals the multifaceted nature of privacy challenges in GIS apps and highlights the gap in current literature regarding the quality of privacy policy writing. The integration of advanced AI methods in this study not only enhances traditional compliance checking techniques but also provides a novel perspective in legal and regulatory analysis. By focusing on GIS applications within the Android ecosystem, the paper contributes to a better understanding of how GDPR principles are incorporated into privacy policies and addresses the unique privacy challenges posed by location data.

 An In-depth Analysis of Jailbreaking Through Domain Characterization of LLM Training Sets  
  Abstract   
 Research on large language models (LLMs) is a prominent field in open-world machine learning. Despite their significant capabilities in natural language processing, LLMs face several challenges that must be overcome, namely, consistency, hallucinations and jailbreaking. In this work we focus on the latter. Jailbreak attacks involve crafting prompts designed to bypass the model alignment safeguards of LLMs, leading to harmful outputs that compromise the safety of the LLM model.   
 Our main contribution is a fundamental vision of jailbreaking in terms of the different domains of language that arise when training and aligning LLMs. This theoretical perspective showcases the limitations of current methods and allows us to classify jailbreak attacks in terms of which deficiency of the model they exploit. This contrasts to current classifications that are based on how the prompt is constructed, such as prompt templating. We conclude that a deeper understanding of the behavior of LLMs is essential to prevent jailbreak attacks.

 Reframing: Detector-Specific Prompt Tuning for Enhancing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection  
  Abstract   
 Object detection in images using natural language prompts has recently become popular due to the extensive development of open-vocabulary perception tasks. We propose an enhancement strategy for open-vocabulary object detection models through a fine-tuning approach named Reframing. The cornerstone of our method is transforming a user’s query into a prompt optimally aligned with the requirements of a specific detection model. This transformation is facilitated by integrating an additional Large Language Model, which undergoes further training. We propose online and offline modes of Reframing, employing deep learning techniques and feedback from the detection models to refine its query transformation process. Our methodology has been applied to various detection models, showcasing its capability to significantly improve prediction accuracy. Developed code and dataset are available at https://​github.​com/​ZoyaV/​reframing    .

 Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Medical Question Answering Using Large Language Models  
  Abstract   
 Generative language models have changed the landscape of artificial intelligence in recent years. However, despite their advanced capabilities, they are prone to generate misleading results and may invent answers. In Spain, the National Health System has collected numerous health guides to inform medical procedures and protocols. In this paper, we utilize advanced generalist language models to extract relevant information and analyze validated content from health clinical guidelines. This approach offers innovative automated support for evidence-based clinical decision making. In our proposal, each of the system’s responses must track the source of the clinical evidence on which it is based, protecting users from hallucinatory responses. To study its feasibility in different medical settings, four clinical guidelines have been evaluated by human medical experts showing high reliability and traceability of evidence.

 Satellite-Guided Herding: Optimizing Pasture Selection for Efficient Livestock Management  
  Abstract   
 This work presents a Python application to determine the best places to conduct herding by analyzing satellite images. Grazing monitoring provides information to identify, from the available zones, which ones are more suitable for maintaining better livestock feeding, thereby improving the quality of products such as meat or milk. To accomplish this, a vision-based system is trained using images from previous years, with ground-truth data provided by an agricultural application, SIGPAC, where farmers determine land use. Once the model is trained, it is applied to new satellite images to identify pasture areas and subsequently determine the coordinates to decide the path for the herd. Among the available options, those exhibiting the highest NDVI levels can be selected as optimal feeding areas for the livestock. This system can be implemented on a 4-legged robot to assist the shepherd in their daily tasks by herding the flock.

 Establishing the Foundation for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Monument Classification Through Nested Dichotomies  
  Abstract   
 This paper introduces a hierarchical approach utilizing nested dichotomies to enhance the MonuMAI framework designed for architectural image classification. The study focuses on developing a foundational layer dedicated to distinguishing between building and non-building images, effectively reducing complexity by filtering out irrelevant data early in the classification process. Through empirical investigation utilizing a fine-tuned EfficientNet model, the study demonstrates substantial progress in handling out-of-distribution scenarios in monument detection. The model effectively filters out irrelevant images while accurately retaining most monument images, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent layers aimed at improving out-of-distribution detection, and recognizing new architectural styles post-deployment. This study specifically emphasizes the initial layer of our innovative system, setting the stage for future expansion and development of subsequent layers. This research marks a significant stride in mitigating OOD challenges within architectural image classification, highlighting the potential of hierarchical methodologies to propel MonuMAI and analogous systems towards more precise and adaptable AI solutions.

 A Preliminary Study on Preprocessing the Semantic Space in Zero-Shot Learning  
  Abstract   
 Realising a general purpose artificial intelligence is an ambitious goal. To do this, new techniques, especially in an open-world context where new tasks may appear, are to be developed to deal with the dynamism and diversity of these systems. A relevant example of this kind is Zero-Shot Learning, where training and test sets have disjoint label sets, so that, no examples of the classes expected in the test (unseen classes) are available during the training phase, and the training (seen) classes are not involved in the test phase. Recent studies aim to generalise from seen to unseen classes by building a variety of models that exploit semantic information in addition to the actual samples (e.g. images). However, the adequacy of the input semantic attributes has not been explored. This initial work studies the influence of preprocessing the semantic space using embedded feature selection within a cross-validation scheme to generalise to unseen classes. The experiments on three well-known zero-shot learning benchmarks show that selecting a subset of the semantic attributes may be beneficial to learning more general methods.

 Lexicon Annotation with LLM: A Proof of Concept with ChatGPT  
  Abstract   
 Lexicon annotation is a critical yet time-consuming task that can hold back the progress of language-intensive projects. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate lexicon annotation, traditionally performed by humans. We present a proof of concept by evaluating ChatGPT's performance on annotating VADER's sentiment lexicon. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves fair performance in this task, suggesting that LLMs can operate as a valuable tool for initial annotations, with subsequent refinements by domain specialists. This approach could significantly accelerate lexicon development and maintenance while balancing efficiency and accuracy. Our study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in lexicon annotation, leading the way for further research in automating linguistic resources development.

 Enhancing RAG-Retrieval to Improve LLMs Robustness and Resilience to Hallucinations  
  Abstract   
 The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models has become a powerful method for generating natural language by incorporating information retrieval. However, the current retrieval phase of RAG models is somewhat simplistic and has several vulnerabilities that affect the quality and relevance of generated responses. One critical issue is determining the distance between the embedded query vector and the external knowledge vectors, alongside the challenge of selecting an optimal number of relevant retrieved documents. The objective of this study is to boost the strength and resilience of LLMs to hallucinations by refining the RAG retrieval process and, consequently, improving the quality of the responses generated by RAG systems for applications like AI-driven customer support, information retrieval, and interactive AI systems with more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments with different numbers of retrieved documents were conducted to enhance answer completeness and implement a threshold mechanism to use only high-confidence contexts during the generation phase. The results of our experiments demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more accurate and relevant responses in RAG models. By increasing the number of retrieved documents, the Relevancy of Answers improves by 16% for GPT-4, while their Correctness shows slight improvements of 4% for GPT-4 and 2% for GPT-3.5-Turbo. Furthermore, our approach is compared with the AutoRAG framework and overall surpasses it in terms of efficiency and response quality.

 VIPER: Vision-Based System to Detect Potential Predators for Herding with Robots  
  Abstract   
 This paper presents a vision system that can be deployed in a ROS2 node that identifies potential predators such as wolves in order to herd autonomously a flock. A pre-trained YOLOv8 model and a pre-trained YOLOv9 model have been fine tunned so as to include more classes that are not supported such as wolves, and the whole models are re-trained with the COCO dataset and the new one, keeping the recognition of the previous learned classes as well as the new ones. To do that a dataset of images of wolves in open spaces has been acquired and labelled for instance segmentation purposes. The obtained vision model is wrapped in a ROS2 node, making it possible to implement it in a robotic device either a 4-legged robot or a rover robot. With this vision-based model, a robot can determine if a potential predator is detected and provide useful information to the herder to avoid area where the flock is in danger. Extensive livestock farming can benefit from the use of this technology to facilitate the tasks required on a daily basis.

 Common Sense Plan Verification with Large Language Models  
  Abstract   
 Verifying the plan before executing it on the robot is an important task because a wrong plan can lead to fatal consequences and damage. In this paper, we propose an approach for verifying a plan before executing it on a robot, which combines the use of a formal language and the use of LLM. We first translate the initial instruction, which may not contain all the necessary actions of the plan, into an LTL formula. And then, based on this formula, we complement the plan with a query to the LLM about the possibility of transitioning from one state to another is carried out. We demonstrate the proposed approach on two datasets, a specialized one dedicated to the task of cooking and a general one dedicated to household chores.

 This research explores the integration of reinforcement learning algorithms within a complex environment developed in Unity. The core of this study is not only to train a UR3e robot to complete a complex task, but also to adapt the behavior to the human presence, in order to dynamically adjust its trajectories in real-time. Avoiding humans while being able to do a job such as taking an object, deciding where to leave it and then getting back to the original position, represent progress in human-robot cooperation. By using a virtual setup, real human-robot interactions will be simulated, allowing for a controlled yet realistic examination of the resultant robot’s adaptive behaviors. The implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms enables the UR3e to learn from the environment and modify its actions based on direct human interaction, thus achieving smoother and safer movements. These findings indicate that reinforcement learning can significantly improve human-robot interaction by enabling robots to anticipate and effectively navigate around humans, offering promising results for future applications in various fields, including manufacturing, healthcare, and personal assistance. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of using reinforcement learning in complex interactive settings but also opens new avenues for enhancing the intuitiveness and safety of human-robot collaborations.

 Artificial Intelligence in Portfolio Selection Problem: A Review and Future Perspectives  
  Abstract   
 Portfolio selection, the process of selecting the optimal combination of securities to achieve investors objectives, is a leading problem in finance. Ever since its inception, the problem has been widely addressed theoretically but its practical applications in portfolio management have seen few changes, with new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) having limited impact in practice. The present study addresses this gap by identifying six main areas of the portfolio selection process and analyzing literature trends and gaps in AI methods within these areas. Additionally, it proposes four primary research avenues where AI can enhance portfolio selection in both theory and practice: i) utilizing alternative datasets and big-data analysis, ii) implementing robust predictive portfolio optimization techniques, iii) applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for dynamic portfolio optimization, and iv) leveraging AI to make portfolio optimization more applicable in real-world scenarios.

 Networked Independent Reinforcement Learners Playing an Evolutionary Game  
  Abstract   
 What kinds of challenges do networked Independent (non-communicative) Learners (IL) face in an evolutionary game? How to deal with the exploration/exploitation dilemma when the agents’ actions can cause their elimination and subsequent extinction of all agents in the network through a cascading failure effect? An approach could be to put the agents’ elimination on hold for a short period. But how does having agents apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques compare to activating them with a certain probability? We were intrigued by an evolutionary game adaptation focused on modeling the evolution of cooperative behavior in realistic systems, as it suggests that rational agents can both survive and profit through cooperation. The adaptation consists of adding a vulnerability to each agent in the network (the lowest payoff needed for it to survive) and an elimination mechanism resulting from the agents’ vulnerability. Here, we show three groups of experiments, all to investigate how agents’ elimination unfolds while networked independent learners play the Prisoner Dilemma Game (PDG) with neighbors in multiple trials – and their interactions cause the elimination of agents, making the game and network co-evolve. We ran various settings to investigate high temptation to defect, and in future work, we will investigate defectors’ added resilience in distinct network topologies.

 Unity-Based Autonomous Driving Environment: A Platform for Validating Reinforcement Learning Agents  
  Abstract   
 Our aim in this research is to develop from scratch a unique racing environment in Unity with the goal of implementing and validating various reinforcement learning algorithms. Once the environment is designed, research efforts will be focused on exploring solutions through different RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithms by modifying rewards, behaviors, and algorithms. To facilitate the implementation of a broader range of algorithms, a Wrapper will be created to allow testing of algorithms using the Stable Baselines 3 library. Additionally, the research will explore the application of different reinforcement learning techniques, such as imitation learning or curriculum learning. After achieving promising results with training a single agent, the research will explore the possibility of training multiple agents simultaneously in the environment to observe how agents learn to interact with each other. Finally, an instructional application will be developed to consolidate the knowledge generated by the various algorithms, enabling users to visually observe the agents’ learning progress. In this application, each algorithm will be represented by a car, allowing users to clearly see the performance of different algorithms in races and laps around the track, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. In summary, the entire research aims to create an instructive and interactive application where the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms can be visually validated in an environment specifically created for the research.

 Using Federated Learning Techniques to Generalize Reinforcement Learning Approaches  
  Abstract   
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent in industrial applications and, specifically, in advanced robotics, both industrial and mobile. This research work explores federated learning techniques to generate more robust and efficient learning models, combining the strengths of different existing reinforcement learning algorithms compensating for their less efficient aspects. To this end, reinforcement learning algorithms that represent the current state of the art have been selected, trained using standard evaluation environments, and then hybridized using federated learning techniques. Tests carried out show a better performance in terms of reward and specially in episode length of the federated algorithm with respect the original reinforcement learning approaches.

  Hybrid event: Towards a History of British HCI 

 Hybrid event: Towards a History of British HCI  
  
 A seminar on the speaker's recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK.  
 Speaker  
 Elisabetta Mori  
 Agenda  
 2:30pm - Welcome  
  4:30pm - End  
 Synopsis  
 The seminar will share with the public the speaker’s recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK, enhanced by a series of new oral history interviews with academics and practitioners in the field. The history of British HCI is rich: Brian Shackel’s article Ergonomics for a Computer, published as early as 1959, is considered one of the first articles in the history of HCI. From the 1970s onwards several British centres in the UK focused on HCI research and development such as the Man-Machine Interaction Group at the NPL and the HUSAT at the University of Loughborough, among many others.  
 The BCS Specialist Group on Human-Computer Interaction was established in 1984, playing a role in the development of the field in the UK and in connecting with the international community. The British HCI conference was one of the main early international conferences that shaped the discipline, while the Alvey Programme, driven by industrial priorities, influenced and gave strength to HCI in the UK.  
 This research was supported by the Archives of IT and the History of Computing Collection, Swansea University, and by a grant from the Worshipful Company of Information Technologies.
