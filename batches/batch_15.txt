 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
 Th e Artificial Intelligence (AI)  program highlights the advances in the field with a focus on leading AI designs and AI usage in design automation. While artificial intelligence and neural network research has been ongoing for more than half a century, recent advances in computing and acceleration of the pace and scale of machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the impact of artificial intelligence on every aspect of our daily lives, ranging from smart consumer electronics and services to self-navigating cars and personalized medicine. While AI was already changing computing from devices through near and far edges all the way to datacenters, more recently, the advances in Generative AI are further transforming our day to day lives and the way electronics is developed from chips to systems.  
 The AI  sessions at DAC focuses on the fundamentals, accomplishments to date, and challenges ahead in development of ML/AI hardware, software and systems as well as application of AI/ML in design automation  , providing a forum for researchers and practitioners across all the widely varying disciplines involved to connect, engage, and join in shaping the future of this exciting field.

   Design (DES)  
 DAC has served as a meeting place for designers of electronics from chips to systems for over five decades. Increasingly, the challenges faced by the industry require co-optimization of design, methodologies and tools that can only be achieved using cross-domain interaction of researchers and practitioners. DAC serves this need by covering design as a topic area in the research and engineering tracks.  
 The design topics covered in the research track include the design of cyber-physical, System-on-Chip (SoC) and multi-die architectures, accelerator-based computing, emerging models of computation such as brain-inspired and quantum computing, digital and analog circuits, and emerging device technologies  .  
 Separately the Engineering Track allows tool users to share challenges and benefits of different tools, flows, and methodologies for IP, front-end, back-end as well as systems and software design, and provides excellent opportunities for education and networking between end users and tool developers. There is no other way to improve your “design IQ” in such a short amount of time than to attend the Engineering Track.

   Electronic Design Automation (EDA)  
 Electronic Design Automation (EDA)  is even more important now with the continuous scaling of semiconductor devices, blending development requirements from chips to systems and extending beyond electronics into interactions with mechanical, electromagnetic effects of system design. Demands for lower power, higher reliability, and more agile electronic systems raise new challenges to design automation enabling such systems. For the past five decades, the primary focus of the research track at DAC has been to showcase leading-edge research and practice in tools and methodologies for the design of circuits and systems.  
 In addition to the traditional EDA topics ranging from physical design to system architectures, DAC features high-quality papers on design research, design practices, and design automation for cross-cutting topics including low-power, reliability, multicore/application-specific/heterogeneous architectures, 3-D integrations, multi-die systems, emerging device technologies, design automation of "things", and their applications  . DAC's EDA technical program has been ensuring the best-in-class solutions that promise to advance EDA.

  Security (SEC)   
 Security (SEC)  sessions at DAC focuses on the urgent need to create, analyze, evaluate, and improve the hardware, embedded systems and software base of the contemporary security solutions. Secure and trustworthy software and hardware components, platforms and supply chains are vital to all domains including financial, healthcare, transportation, and energy. Security of systems is becoming equally important. A revolution is underway in many industries that are "connecting the unconnected". Such cyber physical systems, e.g., automobiles, smart grid, medical devices, etc., are taking advantage of integration of physical systems with the information systems. Notwithstanding the numerous benefits, these systems are appealing targets of attacks. Attacks on the cyber-part of such systems can have disastrous consequences in the physical world. The scope and variety of attacks on these systems present design challenges that span embedded hardware, software, networking, and system design.  
 Security sessions at DAC will feature invited special sessions, panels, and lecture/poster presentations by both engineers and researchers to share their knowledge and experience on this evolving environment.

   Systems (SYS)  
 Systems Design  is the art of choosing and designing the proper combination of hardware and software components to achieve system-level design goals like speed, efficiency, reliability, security, and safety. Systems Design is an increasingly diverse, disruptive, and challenging field for designs ranging from data centers, mobile devices, medical devices, automotive, consumer, robotics, drones, industrial applications and beyond. Software at the embedded scale is built into devices that may not necessarily be recognized as computing devices (e.g., thermostats, toys, defibrillators, and anti-lock brakes), but nevertheless controls the functionality and perceived quality of these devices. Software at the system-level increasingly drives system design requirements as well as workloads that determine chip and system architectures and testing.  
 The Systems sessions at DAC provide a forum for discussing the challenges of embedded design and an opportunity for leaders in the industry and academia to come together to exchange ideas and roadmaps for the future for this rapidly expanding area.

  CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS        
 Workshops Chairs: Brian Clipp, Forrester Cole, Chen Sun, Lijuan Wang        
 Proposal Deadline: Oct 20, 2024        
 Notification by: December 20, 2024        
 Email: workshops-cvpr-2025@googlegroups.com        
 We are soliciting proposals for workshops to be held together with the 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2025). The workshops will take place on June 11 and 12 at the same venue as the main conference in       Nashville        , USA. The purpose of the workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on topics that will not be fully explored during the main conference and to encourage in-depth discussion of technical, application, and community issues. In addition, we strongly encourage and will give special consideration during the review process to workshops aiming to create and strengthen communities (such as affinity workshops like “Women in Computer Vision” or “Good Citizens of CVPR”) as well as workshops focusing on the social impact of computer vision.        
 In the past few years, the number of workshop proposals has been increasing rapidly. Due to space and time limitations, as well as to encourage diversity of topic coverage, we will only be able to retain a limited number of proposals. Therefore, we encourage the workshop organizers to submit proposals that are specific and detailed in justifying relevance, viability and uniqueness. Workshops that are substantially similar to each other in content may be asked to merge.        
 New (Workshop Tracks): This CVPR, to improve the organization of workshops on similar broad topics, we additionally ask submissions to identify a primary subject area (e.g., “Video analysis & understanding”) that they belong to, as well as up to 5 secondary subject areas (e.g., “Behavior analysis” and “Action and event recognition”). This information will be used to create a “track” structure with workshops on cohesive topics (e.g., there may be a track on “Semantic understanding in video” consisting of 4 half-day workshops). Workshops within a “track” will take place in the same room (or be co-located), and workshop organizers will be asked to work closely with others in their track as to avoid overlap in content and speakers to the extent possible. Not every workshop will be assigned to a track – in fact, we encourage submission of workshops on interesting niche topics which will not be part of any particular track.        
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION        
 Workshops will follow the format of CVPR 2025 (in-person and hybrid). More information will be disseminated closer to the conference date. 
  If you intend to peer-review and publish accepted papers in conjunction with CVPR 2025 proceedings, please note the following: | Last day for workshop camera-ready submission will be in April 7 2025 
  Last day for finalized workshop program will be in May 9 2025 
  Sponsorship money for workshops and any award money offered must be managed Workshop organizers 
  Workshop proposals will be in PDF format. Proposals should be submitted through OpenReview at this url: | https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/CVPR/2025/Workshop_Proposals | Please do not directly email proposals to the chairs. 
  EVALUATION CRITERIA        
 Workshop proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria. Their order below does not reflect their importance.        
 Excitement and Relevance | We are looking for workshops which complement the main conference, reflect the CVPR community’s interest in a topic, as well as those that generate new discussion and momentum. 
  We strongly encourage workshops aimed at creating or improving community, workshops focusing on the social impact of computer vision, interdisciplinary workshops, and workshops on niche topics not sufficiently represented at CVPR. 
  Diversity and inclusion | We encourage, and expect, diversity in the organizing team and speakers and invited speakers (e.g., gender, race, affiliations, seniority, etc.), and diversity of opinions represented during a workshop. 
  Proposals should specify how diversity is being addressed. The CVPR 2025 Workshop Chairs ( | workshops-cvpr-2025@googlegroups.com | ) and DEI Chairs ( | cvpr2025_dei@googlegroups.com | ) are available to help if needed. 
  Diversity of topics and formats | We strive for a diversity of topics. Workshops with overlapping topics may be asked to merge (workshops with similar but non-overlapping topics will be grouped within a track). While merging is optional, at most one of the workshops proposed to be merged will be accepted. 
  We strive for different workshop formats, such as invited speakers, challenges, community building, etc. 
  There should be minimal overlap in invited speakers between workshops. Workshop organizers are strongly encouraged to invite speakers who are uniquely relevant to their topics, and to think broadly about inviting speakers beyond those that commonly speak at CVPR workshops. 
  Social impact and ethical consideration | Computer vision may be useful both in positive and negative ways, so we expect workshop organizers to articulate the potential impact of their topics in the proposal and to incorporate those considerations into the workshop itself. 
  We encourage workshops focusing specifically on the social impact of computer vision. 
  Organization | The level of experience of the organizing team and the dedication of the main organizers will be taken into account. 
  The proposal should clearly articulate plans for engaging the audience in the workshop’s intended format (in-person or hybrid) 
  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS        
 Proposals should include the following.        
 TOPIC        
 Workshop title 
  Workshop acronym 
  Topics that will be covered in the workshop. 
  Broader impact statement: Describe why the workshop is relevant to the community and how relevant the topics or discussion are beyond the CVPR audience. 
  Ethical considerations around the topic (if any) 
  Relationship to previous workshops: Describe how this proposal relates to previous workshops held at CVPR/ICCV/ECCV/etc. in the last three years. 
  If you are aware of other workshop proposals being submitted to CVPR'25 that may be suitable to form a "workshop track" please mention this in your proposal (see details above on workshop tracks). 
  ORGANIZERS AND SPEAKERS        
 List of organizers. 
  Primary and secondary organizers responsible for liaising with the workshop chairs. 
  Organizing team’s experience and background: Information that supports the organizers’ ability to run a workshop, and appropriateness to a workshop on this topic, including brief bios for the main organizers. 
  List of invited speakers: Please list only speakers that have confirmed or tentatively confirmed their attendance, and who are willing to deliver a virtual talk if necessary. For each speaker, (a) please indicate if confirmation is tentative or final, (b) provide a link to their homepage, and (c) explain their relevance to the workshop. We recommend finding invited speakers who will not give the same talk at multiple workshops; otherwise, the workshops may be asked to merge. 
  Diversity: Discuss how diversity is being addressed among (a) the organizing committee and (b) the invited speakers. 
  FORMAT AND LOGISTICS        
 Format: CVPR 2025 will be in-person. We will endeavor to support workshops that are in-person, mixed in-person and virtual attendance. This decision will be made by the CVPR 2025 organizers as needed. Organizers should specify in advance their intended format. In particular, describe how you will support virtual attendance if the workshop is partially virtual. 
  Expected workshop size: Small (< 100 attendees), Medium (100-300 attendees), Large (>300 attendees) 
  Request for full-day workshop (optional): all workshops will be half-day by default; if a full-day event is necessary, provide a short justification. 
  Schedule: Provide a preliminary schedule for your workshop. 
  If including paper submissions: (a) Tentative program committee, (b), Paper review timeline, (c) Will these papers be published in proceedings? Note that paper submissions must adhere to the CVPR 2025 paper submission style, format, and length restrictions. 
  If the workshop hosts a competition, describe it: (a) Explain which datasets will be used, (b) Whether the datasets are already available or not; in the latter case, provide an estimate when the datasets will be available and describe your contingency plan in case of delays; (c) Ethical considerations for the datasets, (d) How submissions will be evaluated, (e) The timeline for the competition (start, submission deadline, decisions to participants). 
  If in-person posters are included, how many are expected? 
  Special space or equipment requests, if any. 
  Proposals failing to comply with the guidelines will be desk rejected.        
 UPON ACCEPTANCE        
 The CVPR 2025 organizers will collect workshop registrations, provide facilities, and distribute electronic copies of the workshop proceedings. 
  Workshops will be required to prepare their own websites, separate from the CVPR 2025 webpage. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions, and, once finalized, the workshop program. 
  Workshop organizers will be provided a zoom link only, other hybrid arrangements should be requested by May 2025. No links should be posted outside of the virtual site. 
  Workshop organizers have to communicate by May 2025 if the workshop will be live only or hybrid (fully virtual is not allowed). 
  Workshop organizers are expected to respond in a timely manner to requests from the CVPR 2025 organizers (e.g., by providing the workshop program to be included in the main distribution materials). Failure to respond in a timely manner may result in your workshop’s acceptance being withdrawn at the chairs’ discretion. 
  Workshop organizers should appoint a primary organizer who will serve as the main point of contact between the workshop chairs and the workshop organizers. 
  Program requests must be made by May 2025 (including poster boards) 
  Note that everyone must be registered in advance to attend (even speakers). Workshop organizers will be provided with a limited number of free full registrations and workshop passes to use as they see fit. Last minute requests for registrations will not be granted, even in emergencies. 
  QUESTIONS        
 For any questions, please contact the workshop chairs, Brian Clipp, Forrester Cole, Chen Sun, Lijuan Wang at workshops-cvpr-2025@googlegroups.com.

  Write your papers in the third person to refer to work which was previously undertaken by you, e.g., replace any phrases like “as we have shown before” with “it has been shown before”. 
  Make sure the figures and figure captions do not contain any affiliation revealing your identity. 
  Limit self-references only to papers that are relevant for those reviewing the submitted paper. 
  Cite your own papers as follows: ‘[Anonymous, 2010]’ while in the reference list write, e.g., ‘[Anonymous 2010] Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.’ 
  Remove all references to funding sources. 
  Do not include acknowledgments. 
    
 Publication Policy  
  By submitting a paper the authors confirm that their paper represents original previously unpublished work, and that if accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper/poster.The papers, which are registered but not presented at the conference, will not be included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library — this is the requirement of the publisher.  
   
 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS  with all accepted papers will be published by Conference Publishing Services (IEEE CPS)  . Note that we require at least one non-student registration for each paper  . This registration policy is not for each presenter : i.e., we require two registrations if a single presenter has talks for two papers. The accepted poster papers and posters will require a one-minute fast-forward oral presentation by the presenting author(s) who also have to display and present during the poster session a printed poster (A0 size). The poster authors are also encouraged to set up demos of their works.  
   
 JOURNAL PUBLICATION  The extended version of best FULL papers will be considered for publication in special issues of journals. The information on journal publications of past CW conferences can be found at https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/assourin/CW/cw-conferences.htm

   Frequently Asked Questions  
 What is the Back-End Design Track submission process?    
 To spare experts from industry the many hours of preparation associated with a regular manuscript submission, Back-End Design Track submissions are in the form of a 6-slide PowerPoint presentation.   
 Based on technical program committee review, the accepted submissions will fall into two categories: (a) presentation and (b) poster. Authors of accepted submissions in the presentation category will present their work in Back-End Design Track sessions at the conference. They will also present a poster on the same subject during a Back-End Design Track poster session. Authors of accepted submissions in the poster category will present their work during a Back-End Design Track poster session.   
 Why Engineering Track? How is it different from the Research Track?    
 he Engineering Tracks are intended specifically for design engineers and practitioners, emphasizing real engineering user experiences. Whether you are an EDA tool user, hardware or software designer, application engineer, engineering manager, or a consultant, the Engineering Track is an ideal place to meet and share your experiences. This complements DAC’s strong research focus on algorithms and methodology. The Engineering Track aims to illustrate benefits and challenges of EDA tool usage, the process of creating successful hardware and software products and/or IP, and to provide educational and networking benefits for both end-users and tool developers. Naturally, the topics cut across hardware (GPU/CPU/SOC/ASIC/FPGA/Memory), system and software design, IP and automation, given the rise of highly integrated systems in today’s design projects.   
 What is the Back-End Design Track submission timeline?    
 Check the Submission Timeline above.   
 Are Back-End Design Track presentations and posters included in the DAC Proceedings?    
 No. However, Back-End Design Track posters and/or presentation slides will be made available online if the authors give permission. They will be made available on the DAC website after the conference as a part of the  DAC Archive  .  
 What kind of submissions from EDA companies make successful Back-End Design Track submissions?    
 The Back-End Design Track provides an EDA vendor-agnostic and objective forum for designers, IP developers and EDA tool users. To this end, Back-End Design Track submissions that are essentially marketing material from any company will be rejected. On the other hand, joint customer/vendor submissions written from the perspective of the designer/developer are encouraged and are a valuable part of the Back-End Design Track.   
 Do I have to use a DAC template for my extended abstract?    
 No. But you are required to follow the submission and formatting guidelines listed above.   
 May I add an additional author(s) after submission?    
 No. All authors should be included at submission.   
 My company’s legal department hasn’t approved my submission yet. Can the deadline be extended?    
 No. While we sympathize with your situation (many of us have been there), we have a tight schedule and are unable to accommodate late submissions. If your company permits, you may submit your work for review by the DAC technical program committee without such approval. However, you must obtain appropriate legal, copyright, and any other required permissions well-ahead of the deadline for submission of the final presentation and/or poster, if your submission is accepted for presentation in either format. You will not be able to present any work at the Back-End Design Track without suitable permission from your company.   
 Where do I submit?    
 All submissions will occur electronically through the DAC website. The original submission deadline was January 16, 2024 and that has now been extended to January 23, 2024 at 5:00 PM PT (USA).   
 What does a Back-End Design Track presentation entail?    
 Authors of accepted presentations will be allocated 15 minutes in a Back-End Design Track session: 13 minutes for the presentation, 1 minute for wrap-up, and 1 minute for Q/A. In addition, presenters are required to present a poster describing their work (see below for poster guidelines) at one of the hour-long Back-End Design Track poster sessions and be available for the entire hour to discuss their work with interested attendees. This provides an opportunity for extended discussion with interested members of the audience.   
 All accepted presentations are expected to submit a video of their presentation in advance of the event. This does not replace participation in the event. At least one author must attend and present at the live event.   
 What does a Back-End Design Track poster entail?    
 Authors are allocated a  42” tall x 36” wide area for a poster. Back-End Design Track poster sessions will run for one hour and may include 20-30 posters. Poster authors are welcome to distribute additional material to interested attendees at the poster session. Such material can include extended abstracts and whitepapers.  
 What’s the difference between a Back-End Design Track poster and a Back-End Design Track presentation?    
 Back-End Design Track presentations are oral presentations that are scheduled in sessions that run parallel to the rest of the DAC program and include a poster presentation at a Back-End Design Track poster session at the end of the day. If you are  selected for a presentation, you must produce both a slide presentation and a poster for post-session questions and discussion.  
 Authors of accepted submissions in the Back-End Design Track poster category must  produce a poster that will be presented during a poster session to be held at the end of the day on the exhibit floor for maximum exposure and discussion.  
 What topics are appropriate for the Back-End Design Track?    
 We seek a wide variety of contributions from system engineers, hardware designers, IP developers, systems and software developers, application engineers, automotive electronics developers, security experts, IoT experts, and EDA vendor/customer teams. Documented EDA tool use may target electronic design and system design at all levels of abstraction and across all application domains. EDA tool marketing material is strongly discouraged and will be rejected.   
 How are Back-End Design Track submissions evaluated?    
 The Back-End Design Track program committee consists of industry experts that collectively represent years of design and software development experience. A good Back-End Design Track presentation addresses innovative tool use coupled with high-quality results. Extra notes are encouraged to be included in the submission. The considerations used by the program committee in acceptance decisions include:   
 Significance of results supported by clear, measurable criteria, including, but not limited to: improved quality of silicon, improved reuse, decreased design process complexity, and reduced time-to-market. 
  Level of innovation in tool use, e.g., utilizing one tool to obtain results that aid another tool, writing scripts to combine tools, user-facing enhancements, intelligent data management. A submission should not mirror the help section in the tool's user manual, but instead address a creative way of using the tool. 
  Ability to overcome design challenges such as scalability, integrating IP, and bridging front-end/back-end gaps. 
  Validation of the proposed techniques using real designs, case studies, or established benchmarks. 
  Discussion of the conceptual limitations of tools and suggestions for future tool improvement. Solid technical contributions should address both the strengths and the weaknesses of the approach. 
  Quality of material including writing, illustrations, and organization. 
  Product marketing material is inappropriate for the Back-End Design Track.   
 Does the Back-End Design Track have a “Best of” award?    
 Yes! Best Presentation and Poster awards will be selected from the Back-End Design Track. The awards will be based on (a) the quality of the submission, (b) the presentation given at DAC, and (c) the presentation at the poster session. The final selection will be made at the conference by an award committee. The Best Presentation Award will be announced in the DAC general session. Best Poster Award winners are announced at the close of the Poster Reception.   
 Do Engineering Track participants have to register for DAC?    
 Full DAC conference registrants are automatically allowed to attend the Engineering Track. In addition, both Engineering Track speakers and any participants who want to attend only the Engineering Track sessions, Keynotes, and the Exhibit Floor at DAC can do so at a discounted registration rate via the “Engineering Special” registration package. Please see the DAC registration page for more details.   
 What should my slide presentation look like?    
 Remember that your slides must be presented in 13 minutes, plus 1 minute for wrap-up. Presenting meaningful content in a short time is challenging and requires careful thought and planning. Guidelines for preparing your final presentation are provided in the Engineering Track Speaker Resource Center. Example presentations from previous years can also be found in the  DAC Archives  .  
 My question isn’t answered here! Where can I get an answer?

  Further details will be available soon.   

 Submissions  
 Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.  
 The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body  . Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.  
 The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.  

 Review Process  
 Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 A technique is introduced for generating novel signal processing systems grounded in analog electronic circuits, called model bending. By applying the ideas behind circuit bending to models of nonlinear analog circuits it is possible to create novel nonlinear signal processors which mimic the behavior of analog electronics, but which are not possible to implement in the analog realm. The history of both circuit bending and circuit modeling is discussed, as well as a theoretical basis for how these approaches can complement each other. Potential pitfalls to the practical application of model bending are highlighted and suggested solutions to those problems are provided, with examples.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Recent research in deep learning has shown that neural networks can learn differential equations governing dynamical systems. In this paper, we adapt this concept to Virtual Analog (VA) modeling to learn the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the first-order and the second-order diode clipper. The proposed models achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNNs) albeit using fewer parameters. We show that this approach does not require oversampling and allows to increase the sampling rate after the training has completed, which results in increased accuracy. Using a sophisticated numerical solver allows to increase the accuracy at the cost of slower processing. ODEs learned this way do not require closed forms but are still physically interpretable.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 In this paper we present a virtual analog model of the voltagecontrolled filter used in the EDP Wasp synthesizer. This circuit is an interesting case study for virtual analog modeling due to its characteristic nonlinear and highly dynamic behavior which can be attributed to its unusual design. The Wasp filter consists of a state variable filter topology implemented using operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) as the cutoff-control elements and CMOS inverters in lieu of operational amplifiers, all powered by a unipolar power supply. In order to accurately model the behavior of the circuit we propose extended models for its nonlinear components, focusing particularly on the OTAs. The proposed component models are used inside a white-box circuit modeling framework to create a digital simulation of the filter which retains the interesting characteristics of the original device.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 We have analyzed the Sound Effects Filter from the one-of-a-kind RCA Mark II sound synthesizer and modeled it as a Wave Digital Filter using the Faust language, to make this once exclusive device widely available. By studying the original schematics and measurements of the device, we discovered several circuit modifications. Building on these, we proposed a number of extensions to the circuit which increase its usefulness in music production.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 In addition to tone, pitch and rhythm, dynamics is one of the expressive dimensions of the performance of a music piece that has received limited attention. While the usage of dynamics may vary from artist to artist, and also from performance to performance, a systematic methodology to automatically identify the dynamics of a performance in terms of musically meaningful terms like forte, piano may offer valuable feedback in the context of music education and in particular in singing. To this end, we have manually annotated the dynamic markings of commercial recordings of popular rock and pop songs from the Smule Vocal Balanced (SVB) dataset which will be used as reference data. Then as a first step for our research goal, we propose a method to derive and compare singing voice loudness curves in polyphonic mixtures. Towards measuring the similarity and variation of dynamics, we compare the dynamics curves of the SVB renditions with the one derived from the original songs. We perform the same comparison using professionally produced renditions from a karaoke website. We relate high values of Spearman correlation coefficient found in some select student renditions and the professional renditions with accurate dynamics.

 Download   Antiderivative Antialiasing with Frequency Compensation for Stateful Systems   Pier Paolo La Pastina  ; Stefano D'Angelo    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Employing nonlinear functions in audio DSP algorithms requires attention as they generally introduce aliasing. Among others, antiderivative antialiasing proved to be an effective method for static nonlinearities and gave rise to a number of variants, including our AA-IIR method. In this paper we introduce an improvement to AA-IIR that makes it suitable for use in stateful systems. Indeed, employing standard antiderivative antialiasing techniques in such systems alters their frequency response and may cause stability issues. Our method consists in cascading a digital filter after the AA-IIR block in order to fully compensate for unwanted delay and frequency-dependent effects. We study the conditions for such a digital filter to be stable itself and evaluate the method by applying it to the diode clipper circuit.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 An approach to designing dynamical systems with a three-dimensional state space is described that can be used to build a variety of non-periodic oscillators. The state space is taken to be a 3sphere, which is identified with the manifold of unit quaternions. Any such system can be described as a quaternion-valued ordinary differential equation, which is digitally realized using an approximation as a finite difference e quation. Two examples are shown. Compared to previous applications of dynamical systems used to generate audio samples, the approach described here offers a wide choice of specific flows which can neither diverge nor approach a stable limit point.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Iterative phase formulations allow for the generalization of many oscillatory sound synthesis methods from circles to general parametrizable loops, with or without explicit geometric contexts. This paper describes this approach, leading to the ability to perform modulation, feedback and chaotic oscillations over deformed circles that can include ill-behaved geometries, while allowing modulations or feedback to be deformed as well.

 Download   Continuous State Modeling for Statistical Spectral Synthesis   Tim-Tarek Grund  ; Henrik von Coler    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Continuous State Markovian Spectral Modeling is a novel approach for parametric synthesis of spectral modeling parameters, based on the sines plus noise paradigm. The method aims specifically at capturing shimmer and jitter - micro-fluctuations in the partials’ frequency and amplitude trajectories, which are essential for the timbre of musical instruments. It allows for parametric control over the timbral qualities, while removing the need for the more computationally expensive and restrictive process of the discrete state space modeling method. A qualitative comparison between an original violin sound and a re-synthesis shows the ability of the algorithm to reproduce the micro-fluctuations, considering their stochastic and spectral properties.

 Download   Subjective Evaluation of Sound Quality and Control of Drum Synthesis with Stylewavegan   Antoine Lavault  ; Axel Roebel  ; Matthieu Voiry    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 In this paper we investigate into perceptual properties of StyleWaveGAN, a drum synthesis method proposed in a previous publication. For both, the sound quality as well as the control precision StyleWaveGAN has been shown to deliver state of the art performance for quantitative metrics (FAD and MSE of the control parameters). The present paper aims to provide insight into the perceptual relevance of these results. Accordingly, we performed a subjective evaluation of the sound quality as well as a subjective evaluation of the precision of the control using timbre descriptors from the AudioCommons toolbox. We evaluate the sound quality with mean opinion score and make measurements of psychophysical response to the variations of the control. By means of the perceptual tests, we demonstrate that StyleWaveGAN produces better sound quality than state-of-the-art model DrumGAN and that the mean control error is lower than the absolute threshold of perception at every point of measurement used in the experiment.

   Frequently Asked Questions  
 What is the Front-End Design Track submission process?   
 To spare experts from industry the many hours of preparation associated with a regular manuscript submission, Front-End Design Track submissions are in the form of a 6-slide PowerPoint presentation.  
 Based on technical program committee review, the accepted submissions will fall into two categories: (a) presentation and (b) poster. Authors of accepted submissions in the presentation category will present their work in Front-End Design Track sessions at the conference. They will also present a poster on the same subject during a Front-End Design Track poster session. Authors of accepted submissions in the poster category will present their work during a Front-End Design Track poster session.  
  Why Engineering Track? How is it different from the Research Track?   
 The Engineering Tracks are intended specifically for design engineers and practitioners, emphasizing real engineering user experiences. Whether you are an EDA tool user, hardware or software designer, application engineer, engineering manager, or a consultant, the Engineering Track is an ideal place to meet and share your experiences. This complements DAC’s strong research focus on algorithms and methodology. The Engineering Track aims to illustrate benefits and challenges of EDA tool usage, the process of creating successful hardware and software products and/or IP, and to provide educational and networking benefits for both end-users and tool developers. Naturally, the topics cut across hardware (GPU/CPU/SOC/ASIC/FPGA/Memory), system and software design, IP and automation, given the rise of highly integrated systems in today’s design projects.  
 Are Front-End Design Track presentations and posters included in the DAC Proceedings?   
 No. However, Front-End Design Track posters and presentation slides will be made available online if the authors give permission. They will be made available on the DAC website after the conference as a part of the DAC Archives  .  
 What kind of submissions from EDA companies make successful Front-End Design Track submissions?   
 The Front-End Design Track provides an EDA vendor-agnostic and objective forum for designers, IP developers and EDA tool users. To this end, Front-End Design Track submissions that are essentially marketing material from any company will be rejected. On the other hand, joint customer/vendor submissions written from the perspective of the designer/developer are encouraged and are a valuable part of the Front-End Design Track.  
 Do I have to use a DAC template for my extended abstract?   
 No. But you are required to follow the submission and formatting guidelines listed above.  
 May I add an additional author(s) after submission?   
 No. All authors should be included at submission.  
 My company’s legal department hasn’t approved my submission yet. Can the deadline be extended?   
 No. While we sympathize with your situation (many of us have been there), we have a tight schedule and are unable to accommodate late submissions. If your company permits, you may submit your work for review by the DAC technical program committee without such approval. However, you must obtain appropriate legal, copyright, and any other required permissions well-ahead of the deadline for submission of the final presentation and/or poster, if your submission is accepted for presentation in either format. You will not be able to present any work at the Front-End Design Track without suitable permission from your company.  
 Where do I submit?   
 All submissions will occur electronically through the DAC website. The original submission deadline wass January 16 and has now been extended through January 23, 2024 5:00 PM PT (USA).  
 What does an Front-End Design Track presentation entail?   
 Authors of accepted presentations will be allocated 15 minutes in a Front-End Design Track session: 13 minutes for the presentation, 1 minute for wrap-up, and 1 minute for Q/A. In addition, presenters are required to present a poster describing their work (see below for poster guidelines) at one of the hour-long Front-End Design Track poster sessions and be available for the entire hour to discuss their work with interested attendees. This provides an opportunity for extended discussion with interested members of the audience.  
 All accepted presentations are expected to submit a video of their presentation in advance of the event. This does not replace participation in the event. At least one author must attend and present at the live event.  
 What does an Front-End Design Track poster entail?   
 Authors are allocated a 42” tall x 36” wide area for a poster. Front-End Design Track poster sessions will run for one hour, and may include 20-30 posters. Poster authors are welcome to distribute additional material to interested attendees at the poster session. Such material can include extended abstracts and whitepapers.  
 What’s the difference between a poster and a presentation?   
 All Front-End Design Track work selected to be shared in the conference requires a poster. That poster will be displayed such that it will generate maximum exposure and discussion. The main location is the exhibit floor, with dedicated time for sharing the poster contents.  
 Some work, on top of the posters mentioned above, will also require a presentation. The Front-End Design Track presentations are scheduled in sessions that run parallel to the rest of the DAC program. To clarify, the work that will provide a full presentation must produce both the presentation and the respective poster. The posters that accompany presentations will be displayed immediately after the session, close to the location where the presentation took place.  
 What topics are appropriate for the Front-End Design Track?   
 We seek a wide variety of contributions from system engineers, hardware designers, IP developers, systems and software developers, application engineers, automotive electronics developers, security experts, IoT experts, and EDA vendor/customer teams. Documented EDA tool use may target electronic design and system design at all levels of abstraction and across all application domains. EDA tool marketing material is strongly discouraged and will be rejected.  
 How are Front-End Design Track submissions evaluated?   
 The Track program committee consists of industry experts that collectively represent years of design and software development experience. A good proposal addresses innovative tool use coupled with high-quality results. Extra notes are encouraged to be included in the submission. The considerations used by the program committee in acceptance decisions include:  
 Significance of results supported by clear, measurable criteria, including, but not limited to: improved quality of silicon, improved reuse, decreased design process complexity, and reduced time-to-market. 
  Level of innovation in tool use, e.g., utilizing one tool to obtain results that aid another tool, writing scripts to combine tools, user-facing enhancements, intelligent data management. A submission should not mirror the help section in the tool's user manual, but instead address a creative way of using the tool. 
  Ability to overcome design challenges such as scalability, integrating IP, and bridging front-end/back-end gaps. 
  Validation of the proposed techniques using real designs, case studies, or established benchmarks. 
  Discussion of the conceptual limitations of tools and suggestions for future tool improvement. Solid technical contributions should address both the strengths and the weaknesses of the approach. 
  Quality of material including writing, illustrations, and organization. 
  Product marketing material is inappropriate for the Front-End Design Track.  
 Does the Front-End Design Track have a “Best of” award?   
 Yes! Best Presentation and Poster awards will be selected from the Front-End Design Track. The awards will be based on (a) the quality of the submission, (b) the presentation given at DAC, and (c) the contents delivered at the poster-exclusive session. The final selection will be made at the conference by an award committee. The Best Presentation Award will be announced in the DAC general session. Best Poster Award winners are announced at the close of the Poster Reception.  
 Do Front-End Design Track participants have to register for DAC?   
 Full DAC conference registrants are automatically allowed to attend the Engineering Track. In addition, both Engineering Track speakers and any participants who want to attend only the Engineering Track sessions, Keynotes, and the Exhibit Floor at DAC can do so at a discounted registration rate via the “Engineering Special” registration package. Please see the DAC registration page for more details.  
 What should my slide presentation look like?   
 Remember that your slides must be presented in 13 minutes, plus 1 minute for wrap-up. Presenting meaningful content in a short time is challenging and requires careful thought and planning. Guidelines for preparing your final presentation are provided in the Engineering Track Speaker Resource Center. Example presentations from previous years can also be found in the DAC Archives  .

  Further details will be available soon.   

 Submissions  
 Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.  
 The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body  . Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.  
 The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.  

 Review Process  
 Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

 Call For Papers  
 The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools.  
 Topics of Interest  
 The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a great challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research.  
 The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure.  
 We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged:  
 database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware 
  cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems 
  hardware systems for query processing 
  data management using co-processors 
  novel application of new storage technologies to data management 
  query processing using computing power in storage systems 
  database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices 
  database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors 
  performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware 
  compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance 
  new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads 
  taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing 
  hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph analytics) 
  Submission Tracks

 Keynote Talk  
 NVMe and Data Systems: A Decade and Counting  
 Philippe Bonnet, IT University of Copenhagen  

 Abstract  : NVMe is synonymous with modern storage. It was introduced as a means to efficiently expose Solid-State Drives as PCIe 3.0 peripherals. With NVMe, I/Os were no longer the bottleneck. Initially, the challenge for operating system and database system designers was to accomodate radically faster storage devices. Then, SSDs evolved to meet a range of cost/performance requirements. Accordingly, NVMe 2.0 introduced new transport models, storage models and cross-layer optimizations. This diversity introduced new challenges. Today, NVMe passthru and Flexible Data Placement enable data systems designers to shape how data is stored, instead of designing their systems around the characteristics of opaque storage devices. Computational storage was supposed to further improve the ability of system designers to specialize storage devices to fit their workloads. However, device memory management became a challenge. We discuss the proposed standard and speculate on the role NVMe may play in future data systems, in a context where CXL emerges, PCIe 7.0 is being standardized and power consumption is the bottleneck.  
 About the Speaker  Philippe Bonnet is professor at DIKU, the department of Computer Science of the University of Copenhagen. He contributed to the uFlip Benchmark, the Linux multiqueue block layer, the Linux framework for Open-Channel SSDs, the OX architecture for computational storage, the xNVMe library and Delilah, a prototype for eBPF offload on computational storage. Philippe is co-author of the book “Principles of Database and Solid State Drive Co-Design” with Alberto Lerner. He is currently trustee of the VLDB endowment and chair of the ACM EIG on Reproducibility and Replicability.   Invited Talk  
 Computer Architecture in Flux: The Central Processing Unit Is No Longer Central  
 David Patterson, University of California Berkeley  

 Abstract  : We start with a review of the instability of modern hardware, given the  
 slowing of Moore’s Law, 
  the end of Dennard scaling, and 
  the rise of the demand for AI cycles versus traditional applications. 
  Data is becoming more critical than compute due to its increasing cost and slowing capacity curves for memory and storage. Data location and movement are now central to cost and performance. To build robust systems in light of these changes, we must shift the focus of hardware and software design from processing to the memory, storage, and network components.  
 About the Speaker  David Patterson  is a UC Berkeley Pardee professor emeritus, a Google distinguished engineer, and the RISC-V International  Vice-Chair. His most influential Berkeley projects likely were RISC  (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and RAID  (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). His best-known book is Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach  . He and his co-author John Hennessy  shared the 2017 ACM A.M Turing Award  and the 2022 NAE Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering  . The Turing Award is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing” and the Draper Prize is considered a “Nobel Prize of Engineering.”   Fresh Thinking Talk  
 Effortless Locality Through On-the-fly Data Transformation  
 Manos Athanassoulis, Boston University  

 Abstract  : What if we could access any layout and ship only the relevant data through the memory hierarchy by transparently converting rows to (arbitrary groups of) columns? We capitalize on the reinvigorated trend of hardware specialization to propose Relational Fabric, a near-data vertical partitioner that allows memory or storage components to perform on-the-fly transparent data transformation. By exposing an intuitive API, Relational Fabric pushes vertical partitioning to the hardware, which has a profound impact on the process of designing and building data systems. (A) There is no need for data duplication and layout conversion, making hybrid systems viable using a single layout. (B) It simplifies the memory and storage manager. (C) It reduces unnecessary data movement through the memory hierarchy allowing for better hardware utilization and, ultimately, better performance. In this talk, I will introduce the Relational Fabric vision and present our initial results on in-memory systems. I will also share some of the challenges of building this hardware and the opportunities it brings for simplicity and innovation in the data system software stack, including physical design, query processing, and concurrency control, and conclude with ongoing work for data transformation for general workloads including matrix and tensor processing.  
 About the Speaker  Manos Athanassoulis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Boston University, Director and Founder of the BU Data-intensive Systems and Computing Laboratory and co-director of the BU Massive Data Algorithms and Systems Group. His research is in the area of data management focusing on building data systems that efficiently exploit modern hardware (computing units, storage, and memories), are deployed in the cloud, and can adapt to the workload both at setup time and, dynamically, at runtime. Before joining Boston University, Manos was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Manos obtained his PhD from EPFL, Switzerland, and spent one summer at IBM Research, Watson. Manos’ work is published in top conferences and journals of the community, like ACM SIGMOD, PVLDB, ACM TODS, VLDBJ, and others, and has been recognized by awards like “Best Demonstration” in VLDB 2023, “Best of SIGMOD” in 2017, “Best of VLDB” in 2010 and 2017, and “Most Reproducible Paper” at SIGMOD in 2016. Manos has been acting as a program committee member and technical reviewer in top data management conferences and journals for the past 12 years, having received the “Distinguished PC Member Award” for SIGMOD 2018 and SIGMOD 2023. He is currently an associate editor for ACM SIGMOD Record, co-chair of ACM SIGMOD 2023 Availability and Reproducibility, and co-chair of ICWE 2023 Industrial Track. His work is supported by several awards, including an NSF CRII award, an NSF CAREER award, a Facebook Faculty Research Award, multiple RedHat Collaboratory Research Incubation Awards, and a Cisco Research Award.

 NVMe and Data Systems: A Decade and Counting  
 Philippe Bonnet, IT University of Copenhagen  

 Abstract  : NVMe is synonymous with modern storage. It was introduced as a means to efficiently expose Solid-State Drives as PCIe 3.0 peripherals. With NVMe, I/Os were no longer the bottleneck. Initially, the challenge for operating system and database system designers was to accomodate radically faster storage devices. Then, SSDs evolved to meet a range of cost/performance requirements. Accordingly, NVMe 2.0 introduced new transport models, storage models and cross-layer optimizations. This diversity introduced new challenges. Today, NVMe passthru and Flexible Data Placement enable data systems designers to shape how data is stored, instead of designing their systems around the characteristics of opaque storage devices. Computational storage was supposed to further improve the ability of system designers to specialize storage devices to fit their workloads. However, device memory management became a challenge. We discuss the proposed standard and speculate on the role NVMe may play in future data systems, in a context where CXL emerges, PCIe 7.0 is being standardized and power consumption is the bottleneck.

He is currently trustee of the VLDB endowment and chair of the ACM EIG on Reproducibility and Replicability.   Invited Talk  
 Computer Architecture in Flux: The Central Processing Unit Is No Longer Central  
 David Patterson, University of California Berkeley  

 Abstract  : We start with a review of the instability of modern hardware, given the  
 slowing of Moore’s Law, 
  the end of Dennard scaling, and 
  the rise of the demand for AI cycles versus traditional applications. 
  Data is becoming more critical than compute due to its increasing cost and slowing capacity curves for memory and storage. Data location and movement are now central to cost and performance. To build robust systems in light of these changes, we must shift the focus of hardware and software design from processing to the memory, storage, and network components.  
 About the Speaker  David Patterson  is a UC Berkeley Pardee professor emeritus, a Google distinguished engineer, and the RISC-V International  Vice-Chair. His most influential Berkeley projects likely were RISC  (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and RAID  (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). His best-known book is Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach  . He and his co-author John Hennessy  shared the 2017 ACM A.M Turing Award  and the 2022 NAE Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering  . The Turing Award is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing” and the Draper Prize is considered a “Nobel Prize of Engineering.”   Fresh Thinking Talk  
 Effortless Locality Through On-the-fly Data Transformation  
 Manos Athanassoulis, Boston University  

 Abstract  : What if we could access any layout and ship only the relevant data through the memory hierarchy by transparently converting rows to (arbitrary groups of) columns? We capitalize on the reinvigorated trend of hardware specialization to propose Relational Fabric, a near-data vertical partitioner that allows memory or storage components to perform on-the-fly transparent data transformation. By exposing an intuitive API, Relational Fabric pushes vertical partitioning to the hardware, which has a profound impact on the process of designing and building data systems. (A) There is no need for data duplication and layout conversion, making hybrid systems viable using a single layout. (B) It simplifies the memory and storage manager. (C) It reduces unnecessary data movement through the memory hierarchy allowing for better hardware utilization and, ultimately, better performance. In this talk, I will introduce the Relational Fabric vision and present our initial results on in-memory systems. I will also share some of the challenges of building this hardware and the opportunities it brings for simplicity and innovation in the data system software stack, including physical design, query processing, and concurrency control, and conclude with ongoing work for data transformation for general workloads including matrix and tensor processing.  
 About the Speaker  Manos Athanassoulis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Boston University, Director and Founder of the BU Data-intensive Systems and Computing Laboratory and co-director of the BU Massive Data Algorithms and Systems Group.

 Call For Papers  
 The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools.  
 Topics of Interest  
 The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a great challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research.  
 The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure.  
 We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged:  
 database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware 
  cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems 
  hardware systems for query processing 
  data management using co-processors 
  novel application of new storage technologies to data management 
  query processing using computing power in storage systems 
  database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices 
  database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors 
  performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware 
  compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance 
  new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads 
  taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing 
  hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph analytics) 
  Submission Tracks  
 We invite submissions to two tracks:  
 Full papers: A full paper must be no longer than 6 pages excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the length of the bibliography. Full papers describe a complete work in the area of data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop. 
  Short Papers: Short papers must not exceed 2 pages excluding the bibliography. Short papers describe very early stage works or summaries of mature systems. Short papers will be included in the proceedings, given 4 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version, and may be given a short presentation slot during the workshop. 
  All accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters during a workshop poster session.  
 Best of DaMoN 2024  
 This year all accepted DaMoN papers will be considered for a best paper award  .  
 We intend to invite extended versions of a selection of DaMoN'24 papers for submission to the VLDB Journal. Extended papers that are accepted by the VLDB Journal will appear in a special “Best of DaMoN 2024” section within one of the regular VLDBJ issues.  
 Important Dates  
 Paper submission: March 15th, 2024  March 22nd, 2024 (11:59pm PST)  
 Notification of acceptance: April 26th, 2024  April 29th, 2024  
 Camera-ready copies: May 10th, 2024  May 15th, 2024 (23:59pm PST)  
 Workshop: June 10th, 2024  
 Submission Instructions  
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically as PDF files using the latest ACM paper format  consistent with the ACM SIGMOD formatting guidelines  to the DaMoN 2024 CMT site, at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN2024  . Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Submissions that are 2 pages or shorter excluding the bibliography will be reviewed as short papers. Submissions that are 6 pages or shorter excluding the bibliography will be reviewed as full papers. Submissions that are longer than 6 pages excluding the bibliography will be desk-rejected.  
 Accepted papers will be included within the informal online proceedings at the website. Additionally, all accepted papers will be published online in the ACM Digital Library. Therefore, the papers must include the standard ACM copyright notice on the first page.

 Welcome   
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025), organized by Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia.  
 DSN 2025 will be held in Naples, Italy from 23 to 26 June 2025. Naples, an enchanting city of sea and culture. Naples was founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. Naples is the capital of Campania lies in the bay of the same name next to the volcano Vesuvius and offers a spectacular view as far as the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida. Naples' historic city center is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties, such as Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, and Vesuvius.

 DSN-2025: Research Track Call For Contributions   
 Society is increasingly dependent on the robust functioning of all types of computing systems. These systems include mobile/edge devices, networks, personal computers, and large-scale systems and critical infrastructures that provide services we use in our everyday lives for many applications and problems. Failure, incorrect operation, or compromise of computing systems and networks can have dire implications for the safety and security of human and other lives and the environment.  
 The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is devoted to the mission of ensuring that the computing systems and networks on which society relies are robust, i.e., dependable and secure.  
 DSN, one of the longest-running IEEE conferences organizing its 55th edition in 2025, has pioneered the fusion between dependability and security research under a common body of knowledge, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional (malicious) attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. Its distinctive approach to both accidental faults and malicious attacks has made DSN the most prestigious international forum for presenting research that pushes the boundaries in the robustness and resilience of a wide spectrum of computing systems and networks.  
 All aspects of research and practice of computer system robustness (i.e., dependability and security) are within the scope of DSN. Relevant topics include but are not limited to: 1) innovative systems, architectures, protocols, and algorithms for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, eliminating, or recovering from accidental and malicious threats as well as 2) practical experimentation with and assessment of the robustness (dependability and security) of all types of computing systems and networks.  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers on all topics within this broad scope. Example topical areas include but are not limited to the following:  
 Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, memory systems, systems on chip, I/O devices, storage systems, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), edge and mobile devices, data center infrastructure, hardware accelerators, emerging technologies, emerging paradigms like processing in memory & quantum computing) 
  Software (e.g., applications, middleware, distributed algorithms, operating systems, software security, dependable software design) 
  Networked systems and clouds (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, edge computing, cloud computing/storage, networks on chip, network security) 
  Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, assured autonomy, explainable decision-making, acceptability, privacy issues) 
  Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, real-time control of critical systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, railway, medical systems, security and safety of cyber-physical systems) 
  Distributed ledgers/Blockchain (e.g., BFT/consensus algorithms, cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proofs) 
  AI/Machine Learning for resilient systems (e.g., robust, resilient, secure, and explainable AI/Machine Learning techniques; applications of AI/ML techniques for dependability and security, robustness issues in AI/ML systems) 
  Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and assessing robust (dependable and secure) systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis) 
  Emerging technologies and computing paradigms (e.g., robustness, security, dependability issues of emerging memory and storage systems, emerging computing paradigms like quantum computing, processing in memory/sensors/storage/network, 3-dimensional architectures, new hardware/software cooperative paradigms, emerging programming and system paradigms)

 Information to authors   
 Innovative papers in all areas of robust (dependable and secure) systems and networks will be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference broadly and inclusively favors innovative and insightful research that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art systems. Submissions will be judged on insight, originality, significance, correctness, and potential impact.  
 Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2025, if accepted.  
 All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions.  
 At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work in person.  
 Paper Categories   
 When submitting, authors have to select one of the following categories:  
 Regular papers (11 pages)   : a full paper describing a research contribution, including experimental work focused on implementation and evaluation of existing techniques in the DSN thematic areas. Papers should clearly describe a novel scientific contribution and a significant advancement of the state of knowledge in DSN-relevant topics. The paper should address a significant problem with a compelling solution whose validity and practical applicability are clearly discussed.  
 Practical experience reports (7 pages)   : a shorter paper describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and techniques to real-world problems and systems, or based on the empirical analysis of field data using a rigorous scientific approach. A paper in this category is expected to show new insights and experiences informing the research and practice of robust computing system design. Contributions reporting on industry practical experiences and lessons learned are highly encouraged, including studies reporting negative results or challenges about the practical applicability or scalability of research results in industry.  
 Tool descriptions/demonstrations (7 pages)   : descriptions of the architecture, implementation, and usage of substantive tools to aid the research and practice of dependability. A tool paper is expected to describe and demonstrate the value that the tool brings to the dependability community. Making the tool publicly available, whenever possible, is strongly encouraged.  
 The number of pages indicated above includes everything: title page, text, figures, appendices  , etc. Only references are not included in the page limit. Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review  .  
 Independently of the paper category, we expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results and encourage authors, whenever possible, to make both the artifacts and datasets related to the paper publicly available.  
  
 Artifacts   
 DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. DSN 2025 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track that is open to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools.  
 At the time of the submission, authors must indicate (1) whether they intend to submit an artifact for their submission, (2) the type of artifact (code, dataset, or both), (3) a DOI reserved for the artifact on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare), and (4) the badge(s) they are applying for. For more information about how to reserve a DOI and about the three choices available for the badges, see the Call for Artifacts on the DSN’25 website  .  
 Information about the artifact submission will not be shared with the PC. The artifact does not need to be submitted at the same time as the paper. The artifact can be uploaded at the reserved DOI after the paper submission deadline and can be updated until the artifact submission deadline.  
 The artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a single-blind review process, where authors should be available to respond quickly during the artifact evaluation. All artifacts submitted will compete for a “Distinguished Artifact Award” to be decided by that committee.  
 Anonymization Rules   
 Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. An author should always refer to their own related work in the third person, just like they would refer to any other related work. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments).  
 Anonymization should not be done in a way to hurt the review process. For example, omitting published references or anonymizing them for the purposes of a double-blind process can significantly hurt the review process. As such, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. For example, a paper on experiences with the design of .NET should not be rewritten to be about "an anonymous but widely used commercial distributed systems platform."  
 Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. Avoid names that could in any way be interpreted as being derived from the name of an author or identifying an author’s location or affiliation. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own previously published work. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: “Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2021].” with the corresponding citation: “[Anonymous 2021] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.” This is, for example, the case for extended versions of the paper available online. 
  If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chair in a separate email. 
   
 Authors should also avoid broadly advertising their work in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it (for example, presentations in small meetings or seminars are allowed). It is unacceptable to discuss the work with program committee members. Posting the work on ArXiV or a similar site is within the authors’ rights; however, the authors should use a different title than the submission and they should avoid specifying that the work is under submission to DSN. In particular, please ensure that there are not older versions of the paper on ArXiV that have the same title as the submission.  
 Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization, and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded  .  
 Formatting Rules   
 Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society camera-ready 8.5″x11″ two-column camera-ready format (using a 10-point font on 12-point single-spaced leading) as implemented by the LaTeX/Word templates available at the IEEE conference template  page (last updated in 2019):  
 LaTex Package ( ZIP  )  
 Word Template ( DOC  )  
 Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded in the file. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations, etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of acceptance. Please take a note of the following:  
 Submissions should be anonymous. 
  The page limit includes everything except references. 
  The first page must include the title of the paper, the type of the paper (Regular / Practical Experience / Tool), and a maximum 150-word abstract. 
  Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers: describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them. If the title and abstract are not sufficiently descriptive at the time of the abstract deadline, the submission may be rejected without review. 
  The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (and thus has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. 
  There is no page limit for references - however, authors must not put any text or figures on the pages for the references - if so, those pages will be included in the page limits above (it is acceptable for the references to start on the last page of the paper as long as it is within the page limit). 
  Pages should be numbered. 
  The use of color for figures and graphs is encouraged, but the paper should be easily readable if printed in grayscale. 
  Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. 
  Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB. 
   
 Paper Submissions   
 Papers are submitted via the submission website: https://dsn25.hotcrp.com  .  
 The program committee will perform a double-blind review of all submissions, with help from outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.  
 Authors must anonymize their submissions (see Anonymization Rules). Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.  
 Awards   
 DSN gives three Best Paper Awards and one of them, based on the quality of the oral presentation, will also receive a Distinguished Best Paper Award. All of them will be presented in a special Best Paper Session at the conference.  
 The selection of the candidate papers for the awards is carried out as a three-step process. First, the Program Committee picks 6-7 of the accepted papers based on the review and revision process & committee discussion. Second, the Steering Committee (in consultation with the Program Chairs) chooses among these papers the 3 Best Papers that are to be presented in the Best Paper Session at the conference (all these papers receive the Best Paper Award). Third, and finally, the audience at the conference votes among these Best Papers to select the one that should receive the Distinguished Best Paper Award. Attendees are strongly encouraged to read the Best Papers as well as carefully listen to their presentations, and make their Distinguished Best Paper Award choice based on all information they have about the finalized Best Papers and their presentations at the conference.  
 DSN also attributes a group of awards based on nominations. These awards are the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability, the Rising Star in Dependability Award, the Test-of-Time Award, and the Jean-Claude Laprie Award. Please check the relevant page on the DSN website for additional details.  
 As noted above, there will also be a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Review Process and Author Response   
 This year, as initiated in DSN 2023, in addition to the rebuttal process, DSN is following a Paper Revision Process  . For papers that are not early rejects, the authors will be invited to submit a revised paper (as well as a rebuttal) after receiving their reviews. The major goal of the revision process is twofold:  
 1. to strengthen the papers by making sure reviewer comments are properly addressed in a revised version; and 
  2. to enable the reviewers to see how their comments are addressed in a revised version (which is especially useful in cases where rebuttal may not have the same effect). 
  Through this process, we give the authors the ability to submit both a revised paper (based on the received reviews) and a rebuttal. These two serve different purposes. In particular, the rebuttal remains useful for at least three purposes that cannot be easily accomplished with a revised paper:  
 1. to clarify misunderstandings (and point out any other issues) in the reviews; 
  2. to describe a plan for revisions the author would like to make but need more time for than the revision timeframe allows; and 
  3. to provide a summary of changes that helps the authors to describe how they addressed the reviewer comments in the revised paper. 
  The authors of all papers that are invited for revision will be allowed one extra page to properly address reviewer comments. In other words, the revised (and, if accepted, the final) versions of papers will be allowed 12 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for practical experience reports or tool descriptions/demonstrations. The authors will be asked to mark and describe all the changes they made to the submission during the revision process. More information will be provided to authors of papers who are asked to provide a revision as to how to prepare, format, and submit the revised version of the submission. Note that submitting a revised paper does not guarantee acceptance of the paper to the conference and all revised papers will be reviewed and discussed by the Program Committee.  
 To limit the load on the reviewers, the rebuttal will be strictly limited to 750 words. Any attempt to provide extra information, for example by including images in the rebuttal, will cause the rebuttal material to be discarded.  
 DSN will continue to employ the Early Rejection Notification Policy  . Papers that are rejected in the first reviewing round will receive their rejection notification and reviews by January 27, 2025. As such, the authors may get started earlier on improving their manuscript for a future submission, if they wish to do so.  
 All accepted papers will be subject to the revision and approval of a PC member acting as a shepherd.  
 Open Science Policy   
 After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports the adoption of open source and open data principles and encourages all authors to make their prototypes available to the research community and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Accepted papers can participate in the artifact evaluation process described above.  
 Ethical considerations   
 Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g., by following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.  
 Contact the program co-chairs dsn25pcchairs@gmail.com  if you have any questions.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived conflict to the PC chairs.  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion concerning the paper.  
 Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members   
 To avoid potential bias, the DSN Program Committee Co-Chairs are not allowed to (co-)author any submission to the conference. There are no such restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members including the General chairs since double-blind anonymization rules and conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the processes related to the technical program including the selection of the PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing, and acceptance of papers.  
 Program Committee Co-Chairs

  Paper Submission  
 Paper submission must be in English. All papers will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity. All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review. Each submitted paper should include an abstract up to 200 words and be no longer than 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) in LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format. We encourage authors to cite related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable. All papers must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF only.  
 The submitted papers must not be previously published in a refereed journal or conference and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA review process. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must complete the regular registration and attend the conference to present the paper. For no-show authors, their papers will not be included in the proceedings. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings.  
 Double-Blind Review  
 DASFAA-2024 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, i.e., the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure the anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:  
 Author’s names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper 
  Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper 
  Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper 
  Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the author’s names in the paper’s associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. Submissions must have all details identifying the author(s) removed from the original manuscript (including the supplementary files, if any), and the author(s) should refer to their prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations 
  Submissions having unrefereed pre-prints such as arXiv are allowed. Authors should make every effort to anonymize their work and, hence, cannot cite their own arXiv work. 
  Reviewers will be requested to not try and break the anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines mentioned above, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection. Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an extended version of a short paper that has been published elsewhere is strongly discouraged in DASFAA-2024.  
 Conflicts of Interest  
 We use CMT’s conflict management system, through which authors should flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee. X and Y have a conflict of interest if any of the following applies:  
 X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose - UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara. 
  X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years. 
  X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not resulted in final publication yet). 
  X is the master’s/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was. 
  X is a relative or close personal friend of Y. 
  It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.  
 Paper Acceptance  
 A paper can be accepted as either a full research paper or a short research paper. The authors of full research papers are given the opportunity to present their work in oral sessions, and they also have the option to present in poster sessions. On the other hand, the authors of short research papers exclusively present their work in poster sessions. Additionally, the accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of 10 pages in the camera-ready version.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

  Late Breaking Results  
 Following the successful edition in 2024, DATE 20 25   provides the community with an opportunity to present new and exciting contributions for submission as Late Breaking Results (LBR) papers. LBR papers should cover new research relevant to the DATE topics. Two types of papers can be submitted:  
 breakthrough approaches or novel orthogonal research directions 
  breakthrough results, where sufficient work has been accomplished to indicate the viability of the work 
  Prospective authors are invited to submit Late Breaking Results papers (2 pages and two-column format) describing original and innovative work. Authors should use the template provided on the DATE website, with a blind submission. LBR submission titles must begin with “Late Breaking Results: …”.  
 For creating a successful LBR forum, the LBR submission will be peer-reviewed (blind-review) by a wide-scope TPC committee. Please note that the Late Breaking Results deadline is not an extension of the general paper submission deadline. Accepted LBR submissions will be presented in dedicated technical sessions focussing on live interactions around the submitted work to get feedback and exchange with the DATE community.  
 Authors should use the template provided on the DATE website, with a blind submission. LBR submission titles must begin with “Late Breaking Results: …”.

  Camera-Ready and Presentation  
 Authors of accepted papers will prepare the camera-ready version of the paper, adhering to the IEEE proceedings format and will be checked through PDFeXpress. A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.  
 Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers  
 Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.  Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).  
  Focus Sessions  
 Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.  
 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/  by Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  . The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.  
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions   
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:  
 Session Chair/Co-Chair  : Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

  Camera-Ready and Presentation  
 Authors of accepted papers will prepare the camera-ready version of the paper, adhering to the IEEE proceedings format and will be checked through PDFeXpress. A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.  
 Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers  
 Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.  Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).  
  Focus Sessions  
 Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.  
 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/  by Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  . The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.  
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions   
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:  
 Session Chair/Co-Chair  : Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

  Embedded Tutorials  
 DATE 20 25   tutorial sessions are designed to provide audiences with an introduction to important topics in the DATE technical areas as well as hands-on tutorials on design automation tools. Early career professionals as well as graduate students will benefit from the introductory knowledge about important topics and tools. Mid-career professionals can attend tutorials to extend their horizons. Embedded tutorials will be 90-minute sessions "embedded" within the 3-day programme of DATE. We welcome proposals for tutorial presentations in the DATE technical areas  . Proposals need to be submitted online before Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  Thursday, 31 October 2024 AoE  , via the DATE submission website https://softconf.com/date25/tutorials/  .  
 Technical tutorials on selected topics will be given by leading experts in their respective fields. The submission should motivate the topic and its relevance for both academia and industry, specify whether it covers foundational topics or cutting-edge ones, describe the target audience (expected type of attendees? expected number? match with typical DATE audience?), the reason for a tutorial (why a tutorial, why now). Hands-on tutorials are welcomed. Moreover, the submission should include a brief abstract with a list of learning objectives, and a clear planning hereto (organisation in sessions, possible speakers, what will be done to attract the audience), and the DATE topic to which it is more closely related. We target few top-quality well-attended tutorials. In particular, we look for hands-on and tutorials on fundamentals which should clearly identified in the proposal. Extended conference talks will not be accepted as tutorials. Marketing of company tools are not accepted either.  
 A tutorial submission example is available here for download  .  
 The tutorial organiser(s) will be notified of acceptance or rejection of submissions by Friday, 15 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, final information about the tutorial structure (confirmed speakers, final abstract, final agenda) must be provided by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Tutorial hand-out material (e.g. consisting of all slides and perhaps also background reading material) needs to be uploaded as a single PDF or ZIP file at the DATE website by Friday, 14 March 2025 AoE  .

  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

 Submissions must not exceed 6 pages in length, plus one extra page only for references.  
 WARNING: It is not possible to modify the list and the order of authors once the paper is submitted and the deadline is expired. If the paper is accepted, this information will be the one used for the final publication.   
 All submitted papers should be formatted as close as possible to the final format: A4 pages or Letter sheets, double column, single spaced, Times or equivalent font of minimum 10pt, avoid the use of type-3 fonts. Do not use baseline stretch to compress text. Paper templates are available on the DATE website for your convenience. DATE follows a double-blind review process. To support it, submissions must not include authors' names. In addition, prior work by the same authors should be referenced in full and it should be discussed in such a way that it does not disclose that the work is from the same authors. Any submission that is not in line with the above rules will be discarded. Accepted papers not complying to the above-mentioned formatting instructions will not be included in the conference proceedings. A detailed description of the IEEE authorship guidelines and responsibilities is available here ( https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/author-rights-responsibilities…  ).  
 All papers will be evaluated with regard to their suitability for the conference, originality and technical soundness. The programme committee reserves the right to reorient a submission to an extended abstract.  
 Submissions simultaneously under review or accepted by another conference, symposium, or journal will be rejected. Submissions for which pre-prints are available (e.g., on  arXiv   ) are allowed, BUT these pre-prints may only be published after authors are notified of whether their manuscript is accepted or not. The authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process.   
 Scientific Papers  
 DATE seeks submissions of original, unpublished scientific work  in one of its four tracks (D, A, T, and E) and 33 topics; for track and topic list, see Tracks and Topics list  .

  Camera-Ready and Presentation  
 Authors of accepted papers will prepare the camera-ready version of the paper, adhering to the IEEE proceedings format and will be checked through PDFeXpress. A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.  
 Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers  
 Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.  Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).  
  Focus Sessions  
 Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.  
 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/  by Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  . The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.  
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions   
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:  
 Session Chair/Co-Chair  : Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

  Embedded Tutorials  
 DATE 20 25   tutorial sessions are designed to provide audiences with an introduction to important topics in the DATE technical areas as well as hands-on tutorials on design automation tools. Early career professionals as well as graduate students will benefit from the introductory knowledge about important topics and tools. Mid-career professionals can attend tutorials to extend their horizons. Embedded tutorials will be 90-minute sessions "embedded" within the 3-day programme of DATE. We welcome proposals for tutorial presentations in the DATE technical areas  . Proposals need to be submitted online before Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  Thursday, 31 October 2024 AoE  , via the DATE submission website https://softconf.com/date25/tutorials/  .  
 Technical tutorials on selected topics will be given by leading experts in their respective fields. The submission should motivate the topic and its relevance for both academia and industry, specify whether it covers foundational topics or cutting-edge ones, describe the target audience (expected type of attendees? expected number? match with typical DATE audience?), the reason for a tutorial (why a tutorial, why now). Hands-on tutorials are welcomed. Moreover, the submission should include a brief abstract with a list of learning objectives, and a clear planning hereto (organisation in sessions, possible speakers, what will be done to attract the audience), and the DATE topic to which it is more closely related. We target few top-quality well-attended tutorials. In particular, we look for hands-on and tutorials on fundamentals which should clearly identified in the proposal. Extended conference talks will not be accepted as tutorials. Marketing of company tools are not accepted either.  
 A tutorial submission example is available here for download  .  
 The tutorial organiser(s) will be notified of acceptance or rejection of submissions by Friday, 15 November 2024 AoE  .

 Connecting Theory and Practice: Academic Research in Data Science that Drives Business Innovation  

  Shaqib Siddiqui    October 31, 2024   Data Science    0 Comment     
  
 In an age where data underpins virtually every business decision, academic research in data science is proving to be a powerful catalyst for business innovation. The collaboration between academia and industry creates a unique ecosystem where theories are tested and refined in real-world applications, paving the way for groundbreaking advancements. This blog explores how academic research bridges theory and practice, ultimately transforming industries and redefining the competitive landscape.  
  1. The Academic-Industry Nexus: A Synergy of Ideas   
 Academic research has long been instrumental in laying the foundation for future technological advancements. In data science, this is particularly evident. Universities and research institutions develop cutting-edge algorithms, machine learning models, and data analysis techniques. By partnering with businesses, these theoretical models gain practical relevance and validation.  
 For businesses, working with academic researchers brings fresh perspectives and access to groundbreaking methodologies. For instance, companies exploring advanced AI applications often partner with academic institutions to access highly specialized skills and research, which they can then adapt and implement. This collaboration enables businesses to stay ahead of the curve while offering academia an opportunity to see their work in action, fueling further inquiry and refinement.  
  2. Driving Business Value Through Applied Data Science   
 Academic research provides businesses with data science methods that go beyond incremental improvements to drive value in significant ways. Here are some examples:  
 Predictive Analytics: | Academic research in predictive analytics enables companies to anticipate market trends, optimize supply chains, and even predict customer behavior. In sectors like retail, healthcare, and finance, these capabilities can transform operations, reducing costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
  Natural Language Processing (NLP): | Advances in NLP from academic research have significantly impacted customer support, market analysis, and content management systems. Businesses utilize NLP algorithms to gain insights from unstructured data, such as customer reviews or social media, enabling them to respond to customer needs with greater precision. 
  Deep Learning and Image Recognition: | Used extensively in areas like autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and retail, innovations in deep learning from academia have reshaped traditional processes. For instance, in healthcare, research-backed image recognition techniques help doctors detect diseases earlier, improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare costs. 
  These innovations highlight how academic theory, when applied to real-world challenges, has the potential to bring transformative change across industries.  
  3. Translating Complex Theory to Practical Solutions   
 One of the greatest challenges for businesses is translating the complex theories developed in academic research into actionable solutions. This is where data scientists play a pivotal role in bridging the gap, interpreting advanced research findings into strategies that businesses can deploy.  
 Companies like IBM, Google, and Amazon invest heavily in translating theoretical research into products that offer real-world value. For example, Google’s BERT model, a breakthrough in language processing developed from academic research, has been adapted to improve search engine performance and understanding of natural language.  
 Additionally, open-source platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch—originally products of academic research—provide tools that democratize machine learning. With these tools, companies can implement and experiment with advanced algorithms without having to build them from scratch, accelerating innovation and time-to-market.  
  4. Data Science for Social Impact: Ethical Considerations in Business Applications   
 A crucial contribution of academic research in data science is the ethical dimension it brings to business applications. Researchers delve into the implications of data privacy, bias, and transparency, creating a foundation for ethical data use that guides businesses in responsible innovation.  
 Businesses today operate under heightened scrutiny concerning how they handle data. Ethical frameworks developed by academic researchers help organizations navigate complex issues such as bias in AI algorithms and data protection, ensuring that their innovations are both responsible and legally compliant. These ethical considerations are not just beneficial but essential in industries like finance, healthcare, and government, where trust and fairness are critical.  
  5. Fostering a Culture of Continuous Learning and Innovation   
 For businesses, collaborating with academia provides more than just technical insights; it fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptability. As data science evolves, businesses that engage in academic partnerships remain agile, adapting to new methods and refining their processes accordingly.  
 For example, telecommunications and finance sectors invest in collaborative research with universities to anticipate changes and identify future trends. By engaging in such partnerships, they build teams that are not only skilled in data science but are also open to new ideas and approaches, a crucial advantage in rapidly changing industries.  
  6. The Future: Academic Research as a Driver of Industry Transformation   
 The future of business innovation will undoubtedly be shaped by advancements in academic research in data science. From AI-driven decision-making to real-time analytics and automated processes, the next generation of business tools and strategies will continue to be rooted in academic findings.  
 Moreover, as data science becomes increasingly interdisciplinary, drawing from fields like neuroscience, psychology, and economics, we can expect to see even richer collaborations between academia and industry. Businesses that actively participate in these collaborations will not only benefit from the latest insights but will help shape the future of the industry itself.  
  Conclusion   
 Academic research in data science is a critical driver of business innovation, enabling companies to harness the latest theoretical advancements for practical applications. Through collaboration, ethical considerations, and continuous learning, businesses can use academic research to create impactful, responsible solutions that redefine industry standards. As we move forward, the synergy between academia and industry will continue to expand the frontiers of what’s possible, pushing businesses toward new horizons of data-driven success.

 The International Conferences and Workshops on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA)  , formerly the International Conference and Workshop(s) on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA) and the International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA), provides a forum for presenting research results in the area of database and intelligent systems and discussions on advanced applications and issues related to these areas. It will offer the opportunity to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in the field. The conference and associated workshops will inspire a fruitful dialogue between developers in practice, users of database and expert systems, and scientists working in the field.  
 Organizer: International Organization for Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (@WAS; short Web Applications Society), hosted by the Institute for Telecooperation (2019-present), and the DEXA Society /Association, hosted by the Institute for Application Oriented Knowledge Processing (1990-2018). Both are institutes of the Johannes Kepler University Linz.  
 Co-located relevant recurring conferences and workshops:  
 1999 – present: | International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK) | The International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery, formerly the International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK), has become one of the most important international scientific events to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss latest research issues and experiences in developing and deploying data warehousing and knowledge discovery systems, applications, and solutions. 
  2009 – 2022: | International Workshop on Biological Knowledge Discovery from Big Data (BIOKDD) | In the recent years, there has been a rapid development of biological technologies producing more and more biological data, i.e., data related to biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins). The rise of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, also known as high-throughput sequencing technologies, has contributed actively to the deluge of these data. In general, these data are big, heterogeneous, complex, and distributed in all over the world in databases. Analyzing biological big data is a challenging task, not only, because of its complexity and its multiple and numerous correlated factors, but also, because of the continuous evolution of our understanding of the biological mechanisms. Classical approaches of biological data analysis are no longer efficient and produce only a very limited amount of information, compared to the numerous and complex biological mechanisms under study. From here comes the necessity to adopt new computer tools and develop new in silico high performance approaches to support us in the analysis of biological big data and, hence, to help us in our understanding of the correlations that exist between, on one hand, structures and functional patterns in biological macromolecules and, on the other hand, genetic and biochemical mechanisms. Biological Knowledge Discovery from Big Data (BIOKDD), formerly the International Workshop on Biological Knowledge Discovery from Data and Data Mining, resp. (BIOKDD) is a response to these new trends. 
  2019 – 2022: | International Workshop on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs (MLKgraphs) | Knowledge Graphs are becoming a key technology for large-scale information processing systems containing massive collections of interrelated facts. Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means for development of the newest data methods for data management, data fusion, data merging, and graph optimization and modeling, serving as a source of high quality data and a base for web-scale information integration. | The International Workshop on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs aims to be a meeting point for researchers and practitioners working on the latest advances in the intersection of machine learning technologies and knowledge graphs. 
  2000 – 2006: | Workshop on Theory and Applications of Knowledge Management (TAKMA) | Knowledge Management is a broad field that covers the elicitation/extraction, sharing and application of knowledge within organisations. Each of these areas has received focussed attention in separation to each other; this workshop is intended to bring together academic researchers with developers and users from the industry and public administration to share their expertise on Knowledge Management aspects that is of interest to other areas. | TAKMA Workshop Papers  2006

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA
