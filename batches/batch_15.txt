 Call for Hosting India HCI 2025  

 India HCI is an annual conference that provides a platform for designers, design academicians, students, industry and start-up partners, and other HCI-based design enthusiasts to meet and discuss their interests. In the past, it has always been organised in cooperation with the ACM SIGCHI. The conference attracts an interdisciplinary audience from both design and engineering disciplines. It offers a variety of submission tracks, such as Papers, Student Research Consortium, Student Design Consortium, Industry Presentations, and Posters & Demos, as well as Workshops, Courses, and Out of India track catering for attendees from both academics and industry. This multi-track format of the India HCI conference includes talks, presentations, panel discussions, exhibitions, and demos. The conference is typically held between October and December, taking three full days.  
   
 The India HCI Steering Committee is accepting proposals for hosting and organising the India HCI conference in 2025. Please submit the proposal via email at  shri@iitg.ac.in  and the deadline for proposal submission is  30th June 2024.  The India HCI Steering Committee will make the final decision in   July 2024.  The selected host for the conference will be publicly announced during the closing ceremony of the India HCI conference 2024. Additionally, thank-you and reminder emails to all the participants of the India HCI conference 2024 and all the members of HCIPAI will also include the announcement.  

 Proposal Outline   
   
 The proposal for hosting and organising the India HCI conference in 2025 should primarily address the following three key aspects.  
 First, briefly explain the proposers’ motivation for hosting and organising the next India HCI conference in 2025. 
  Secondly, briefly describe who the proposers are, including affiliations and relevant experience and expertise. This should include a short bio of the general co-chairs from the organising institution or institutions (if a joint proposal of two institutions, one institution as host organiser and another institution as a co-organizer) committed to working with the India HCI Steering Committee in organising the conference. While we encourage proposers to approach people who have taken on one or more of these roles in the past, we also encourage them to bring in a good balance of new people. We suggest that proposers approach former and current general chairs of India HCI conferences if they have any specific questions to make the proposal stronger. 
  Finally, the proposal should detail the proposers’ preparation for hosting the conference and how they plan to make it a success that promotes equality, diversity and accessibility. This should include the following points in addition to any other relevant details: 
  The theme of the India HCI conference 2025. Why the given theme, and how it makes this proposal stronger? 
  Proposed venue and its advantages. 
  Multiple sets of potential conference dates (preferably between mid-October to December) when the host institute has committed to supporting the conference. 
  How the proposers plan to manage the conference, starting from the formation of the organising committee, finalising relevant information (including deadlines) for the call for papers and conference registration, finalising details for the conference website, and inviting keynote speakers. This should also include an overview of the tentative budget distribution and potential sponsors. 
  Most importantly, the host institute’s ability to manage the logistics and administration to accommodate three days of the multi-track conference. The logistics primarily include the availability of at least one main conference hall to accommodate all attendees (200+) and up to 4 seminar halls for parallel sessions with audio-visual facilities and a WiFi network to support remote participation. Space and facilities to support gatherings for exhibitions, coffee breaks, lunch, and banquets. Guest house, hotels (or similar facilities nearby) for national and international delegates. Residential facility for student volunteers. This may also include references to previous experiences of organising similar events as the host institution. 
  While the organisers will have a lot of freedom to organise the conference, the India HCI Steering Committee will help the organisers with key tasks such as creating the budget, finalising the papers chairs and keynote speakers and tracking the conference timeline. The proposers must commit to working with the India HCI Steering Committee and being transparent in their presentation of their organisation of the conference to the Committee. The proposers must commit to reporting to the India HCI Steering Committee and participate in the India HCI Steering Committee meetings regularly. The India HCI Steering Committee meets at least once a month and, at times, more often, depending on the need. Currently, most meetings are virtual, though, in the past, we have organised in-person meetings when opportunities arise. 

 To promote the development of professionals, researchers and students of all disciplines related to human-computer interaction

 Submission  
 Submissions for the main symposium or a special track must be in PDF file format (20MB max size). Authors will be able to update/change their paper submission(s) before the deadline. All information submitted must be error free, as it will be used for reviewing purposes and to generate the final symposium program and proceedings. During submission, you will be asked to select some research topics (including special tracks) that best fit your paper(s). Please, carefully choose these topics as they will be used by the system to find qualified reviewers for your paper(s).  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee (PC) using a “double-blind” review process to determine its appropriateness for acceptance and presentation (oral or poster) at ISVC. Therefore, paper submissions should not contain names or other information revealing authors’ identity  .  
 A complete paper should be submitted in camera-ready format for review purposes. The length should match that intended for final publication. Papers accepted for the symposium will be allocated 12 pages in the proceedings (including references), with the option of purchasing up to 2 extra pages for $100 per page. If you are unwilling or unable to pay the extra charge you should limit yourself to 12 pages. Otherwise the page limit is 14 pages. All paper submissions will be handled electronically through our online web submission system.  
 Review  
 This is a fully refereed symposium. Papers submitted to ISVC must not have been previously published and must not be currently under consideration for publication in another conference. Submissions will be reviewed with an emphasis on potential to contribute to the state of the art in the field. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and presentation quality. The form of presentation (oral or poster) will be decided based on the reviews of each submission and recommendation of the program chairs and the steering committee.  
 ChatGPT policy:  ChatGPT can be used for proofreading assistance but NOT  for manuscript writing, manufacturing of data, results, and arguments. Strong suspicion of violation of the above policy will result in automatically rejecting the submission.  
 Attendance  
 ISVC is a premier forum for presenting and discussing current research in visual computing. At least one author must attend and present the paper at the symposium. If no author can attend the symposium and present their paper(s) due to unforeseen reasons, they should contact the steering committee chair to make alternative arrangements (i.e., video presentation or presentation by another attendee).  Papers not presented at the symposium without a valid reason will be withdrawn from the symposium proceedings.   
 Publication  
 All papers, regardless to the form of presentation (i.e., oral or poster), will appear in the symposium proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). In submitting a paper the author(s) agree that, upon acceptance, they will prepare the final manuscript in time for inclusion into the symposium proceedings, attend the symposium in person, and present the paper.  
 Formatting  
 To format your paper, follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) guidelines and technical instructions  closely. Springer will eventually re-format all papers to produce the camera-ready pdf versions using the same formatting instructions. Therefore, if an author has squashed his or her paper by removing vertical spaces or changing font sizes, etc., the final pdf will cover more pages and additional page charges will apply.  
 Color Pages  
 There is no charge for color pages in the on-line  paper proceedings. Color figures in the printed  paper proceedings cost between 250 Euros per page on average and must be explicitly requested during registration (i.e., email admin@isvc.net).  
 Camera-Ready Manuscripts  
 Papers will be published both in printed proceedings and online. Since papers would need to be reformatted, besides submitting the pdf version of your paper, you would also need to submit ALL  files needed for generating the pdf file, for example:  
 (1) the tex-file(s) including any special style files you may have used,  
  (2) all images and illustrations in PostScript and/or PDF, and the final document in  
  (3) DVI (or Word doc and rtf file),  
  (4) PostScript and  
  (5) PDF formats.  
 Create a single gzipped tar-file or a ZIP archive file containing all files. Specific instructions where to upload your gzipped file will be provided at a later time.  
 As noted earlier, Springer will re-produce the final pdf version of all papers. They will contact you by email at a later time (i.e., after 3-4 weeks) for final approval of your paper(s). The e-mail will come from India and will have attachments (i.e., make sure that your spam filter does not reject it!!).  
 Copyright form  
 The copyright form can be downloaded from the LNCS web site  . It must be signed by at least one author to publish the paper in Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science. Papers without signed copyright form will not be included in the proceedings. Please sign the form and submit it along with your final paper materials. In the “Editors” field, please put “Bebis et al.”

 Osaka, Japan | July 11-13  
 2025 9th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality  

 ABOUT AIVR  
 2025 9th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality (AIVR2025)  brings together researchers and scientists, both industrial and academic, developing novel Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality outcomes. Research in Virtual Reality (VR) is concerned with computing technologies that allow humans to see, hear, talk, think, learn, and solve problems in virtual and augmented environments. Research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) addresses technologies that allow computing machines to mimic these same human abilities. Although these two fields evolved separately, they share an interest in human senses, skills, and knowledge production. Thus, bringing them together will enable us to create more natural and realistic virtual worlds and develop better, more effective applications. Ultimately, this will lead to a future in which interaction between man and machine are made naturally in virtual worlds, with use cases and benefits we are only just beginning to imagine.  
 AIVR 2025 will be held in Osaka, Japan  during July 11-13, 2025  with focusing AI technologies and virtual reality. Past conferences were held in Nagoya (2018), Singapore (2019), virtual conferences (2020, 2021 and 2022), Kumamoto (2023) and Fukuoka (2024) respectively. This conference in the successful AIVR series provides an ideal opportunity for reflection on developments over the last two decades and to focus on future developments. We look forward to welcoming AIVR2025 in Osaka to provide the international community with a highly interactive and scientifically excellent conference to further the translation of promising AI & VR technologies.

 Secure Federated Distillation Framework for Encrypted Traffic Classification  
  Abstract   
 Encrypted traffic classification is essential for cyberspace governance. However, due to the privacy issues associated with network traffic, most organizations, such as hospitals, government agencies, and universities, are reluctant to disclose their network traffic. Malicious users can spread illegal information or commit cybercrime on the intranet via VPN or TOR. In this paper, we adopt federated learning to provide a new solution for encrypted traffic classification in darknet. Meanwhile, we introduce federated distillation to solve the problems of excessive communication overhead and Non-IID data. In addition, secret sharing is used for privacy federated distillation. By introducing sharpening coefficients, we effectively improve the robustness of the framework against data poisoning attacks and Byzantine attacks under an honest majority. We conduct extensive experiments on public dataset ISCX CICDarknet2020 and real dataset DarkCSE2023 containing popular application traffic, including VPN and Tor. Experiments show that our proposed framework achieves precision of 96.63%  and recall of 96.76%  in centralized setting, precision of 90.02%  , and recall of 89.60%  in federated setting, which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

 TriNT: A Framework for ROV Identification Based on Triplet  
  Abstract   
 The inter-domain routing system of the Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASes), with their security mechanisms affecting the overall security of the Internet. Route Origin Validation (ROV) is a security technique for curbing malicious attacks against the routing system. The use of ROV by ASes is the basis for studying many aspects of the Internet, such as assessing Internet security and robustness. Previous research for passively measuring the status of ROV operation have been limited to specific types of ASes, such as Vantage Points (VPs) or stub ASes. We propose an ROV identification framework called TriNT that measures the path triplet difference between valid and invalid routing paths. The ROV identification results of the TriNT closely match the implementation of ROV as announced by the AS operators. Compared with previous methods, TriNT has a low network overhead, a short experimental cycle, and recognition of a wide range of ASes.

 Lattice-Based Universal Designated Multi-verifiers Signature Scheme  
  Abstract   
 In a universal designated multi-verifiers signature ( UDMVS  ) scheme, any signature holder, not necessarily the signer, can non-interactively prove to a set of specific verifiers the fact that the signature holder holds a valid signature from the signer, but the designated verifiers are unable to convince any third party of this fact. However, the existing UDMVS  schemes based on the large integer factorization problem and the discrete logarithm problem on finite field or elliptic curve are no longer secure in the post quantum era. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lattice-based UDMVS  scheme, which is resistant to quantum computing attacks, it also avoids the risk of online eavesdropping attacks on existing universal designated verifier signature schemes. Moreover, based on the small integer solution ( SIS  ) problem and the learning with errors ( LWE  ) problem, the proposed lattice-based UDMVS  scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model for the strong unforgeability, the non-transferability and the privacy of signer’s identity.

 Differential Cryptanalysis Against SIMECK Implementation in a Leakage Profiling Scenario  
  Abstract   
 Even though SIMECK as a lightweight block cipher can be secure against differential cryptanalysis, the practical security of SIMECK implementation against differential cryptanalysis is not clear. In light of this, the security of three versions of SIMECK implementation against differential cryptanalysis is considered in a leakage profiling scenario. In a leakage profiling scenario, the leakages of three versions of SIMECK implementation can be characterized and template attack can be used to recover the eighth round output. Then, eight-round differential cryptanalysis based on some three-round differentials can be performed to recover the secret key used by SIMECK implementation. We evaluate the efficiency of this combinatorial analysis style in simulated scenario where the values of different parameters that can influence the efficiency of template attack are under full control. The evaluation results show that about 340, 720 and 1040 correct pairs of samples can be enough to recover the secret key of three versions of SIMECK implementation with at most \(2^{21}\)  exhaustive search, and the success rate of key-recovery can be higher than 90%. Therefore, inner rounds of SIMECK implementation should also be protected to counteract side-channel attacks.

 Shrinkable Ring Signatures: It Wasn’t Them!  
  Abstract   
 Ring signatures facilitate a signer to arbitrarily form a set of ring members and produce a signature on their behalf without exposing his own identity. Once signed, the signature is fixed to these particular participants. However, what if, in the future, due to problems with other members, the signatory wants to exclude them from the initial ring, making the signature represent fewer members? For instance, an entrepreneur wishes to remove his arrested business partners from his previously signed ring signatures to stay out of trouble; he desires to prove that it wasn’t them who signed the signatures while keeping himself anonymous among the remaining ring members. Unfortunately, no existing variants of ring signatures can provide a feasible solution for this situation. To address this issue, we introduce a new notion of Shrinkable Ring Signature  (SRS), which allows a signatory to prove later that his already signed signature is actually on behalf of a smaller ring than the original one. We also formalize the syntax and security models for SRS. In terms of construction, we design a generic framework for an SRS from a Merkle-tree-based accumulator, a collision-resistant one-way function, a public key encryption scheme, a string commitment scheme, and a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system. We show that our scheme is anonymous, unforgeable and shrinkable under the random oracle model. With regards to efficiency, the size of the produced signature only grows logarithmically with the number of ring members. Additionally, we present a concrete instantiation from lattices whose security relies on the SIS and LWE assumptions.

 Related-Tweakey Boomerang and Rectangle Attacks on Reduced-Round Joltik-BC  
  Abstract   
 As one of the candidates for authenticated encryption in the second round of the CAESAR competition, Joltik has an internal lightweight tweakable block cipher Joltik-BC. In ASIACRYPT 2014, designers stated that the real threat to Joltik-BC comes from attacks that exploit the tweakey schedule, i.e. related-tweakey differential attacks. However, there has been no such attack against Joltik-BC currently. In the paper, we evaluate the resistance to Joltik-BC against boomerang attacks. Considering that not all distinguishers with high probability have a significant effect in key recovery attacks, we incorporate the complexity of key recovery into the search for distinguishers and turn to search for the entire truncated attack paths. Specifically, by considering truncated differential propagation, we control the number of active nibbles on the sides of plaintext and ciphertext to reduce key guessing. Then we apply it to search for appropriate distinguishers of Joltik-BC. Finally, we propose a 10-round related-tweakey boomerang attack for Joltik-BC-128 and a 14-round related-tweakey rectangle attack for Joltik-BC-192. To reduce the time complexity, we also utilize the property of components to guess partial key bits and deduce other key bits. This is the first work to evaluate the resistance of related-tweakey boomerang attack for Joltik-BC and both of them increase the round number of key recovery attacks.

 Isogeny-Based Password-Authenticated Key Exchange Based on Shuffle Algorithm  
  Abstract   
 At CRYPTO 2022, Abdalla et al. incorporate the ability to compute the quadratic twist of elliptic curves to extend the framework of group actions introduced by Alamati et al. (ASIACRYPT 2020), and proposed two password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols. Their first protocol \(\textsf{X}\)  - \(\textsf{GA}\)  - \(\textsf{PAKE}_\ell \)  is a provably secure one-round isogeny-based scheme with a password length of \(\ell \)  , which improves security by increasing computation and communication overhead. In \(\textsf{X}\)  - \(\textsf{GA}\)  - \(\textsf{PAKE}_\ell \)  , each party needs to choose \(2 \ell \)  elements and perform \(5 \ell \)  group actions. In this paper, we present an isogeny-based PAKE protocol that is more efficient than \(\textsf{X}\)  - \(\textsf{GA}\)  - \(\textsf{PAKE}_\ell \)  . In our scheme, we reduce the number of set elements to \(\ell \)  , thus the overhead of communication between users and servers is significantly decreased. By using the shuffle algorithm, the number of group actions that each party needs to perform is reduced to \(2\ell \)  , but our protocol can still prevent trivial attacks using twists. Due to the use of Merkle root and password in the shuffle function, the attackers cannot select a message from the received message. Also, the length of the message used for key derivation is reduced from \(3\ell \)  to \(\ell \)  . We prove the security based on the security assumption in the isogeny-based setting.

 A New Construction of Leakage-Resilient Identity-Based Encryption Scheme  
  Abstract   
 Although a large number of provably secure cryptographic primitives have been proposed in the literature, many of these schemes might be broken in practice because of various leakage attacks. Therefore, the leakage resilience property should be considered in designing these primitives. However, in identity-based cryptography, most of the existing leakage-resilient identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes suffer some limitations: they either resist the leakage attacks in the selective identity security model or achieve the chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security based on a non-static assumption. To further solve the above problems, in this paper, an IBE scheme with adaptive leakage-resilient chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) security is proposed, and its security is rigorously proved in the random oracle model under a classic static assumption, e.g., decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In addition, the leakage-resilient CCA security can be obtained from the above CPA secure IBE scheme. That is, a generic method created leakage-resilient CCA secure public-key encryption is proposed, and the leakage-resilient CCA secure IBE scheme can also be created. Therefore, we propose a noval method to create leakage-resilient IBE scheme with CCA security from static complexity assumption.

 Enhancing Portability in Deep Learning-Based Side-Channel Attacks Against Kyber  
  Abstract   
 Despite extensive research on side-channel attacks (SCAs) against lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs), there has been limited attention to the portability of existing deep-learning-based SCA distinguisher, especially concerning the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) KEM standard Kyber. Our work addresses the portability challenges that stem from the device and measurement variations in SCAs against Kyber. We focus on the plaintext checking oracle-based SCA against Kyber, a prominent method in the field. We propose the Ablated Multiple Leakage Point Model (Ablated-MLPM) approach to optimize deep learning models, enhancing intra-board (same device with different EM probe placement) and inter-board (different devices) portability while mitigating overfitting concerns. Our contributions include the first systematic analysis of portability issues in SCAs against Kyber, highlighting their negative impact on attack efficiency. Real-world implementations are conducted on an STM32F407G board with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, using code from the well-known open-source pqm4 library. The results demonstrate that our Ablated-MLPM approach achieves more than \(99\%\)  accuracy in all datasets, significantly enhancing both intra-board and inter-board portability. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight model, Ablated-MLPM-LW, reducing the training parameters by \(79.63\%\)  at the cost of requiring more queries.

 Generic CCA Secure Key Homomorphic KEM and Updatable Public Key Encryption  
  Abstract   
 Updatable Public Key Encryption (UPKE) is a technique for updating public and private keys in secure messaging protocols, which was initially introduced by Jost et al. (EUROCRYPTO ’19). Alwen et al. (CRYPTO ’20) later provided an IND-CPA secure UPKE. Asano et al., in turn, applied the FO transformation to UPKE outputs to achieve IND-CCA security. However, their approach doubles the time complexity, as they treat the IND-CPA UPKE as a black box that runs the encryption process once. In this paper, we formalize an IND-CCA model for key encapsulation mechanisms that involve a one-way homomorphic function which is named key homomorphism (KhKEM). If we construct a UPKE scheme from an IND-CCA KhKEM, a one-way secure pseudorandom generator, and an IND-CCA Encrypt-then-MAC symmetric encryption scheme, we demonstrate that this generic hybrid UPKE design will be IND-CCA secure. We finally consider three KhKEM instances and discuss the parameters and efficiency. We show that our scheme has better efficiency compared with Asano et al.’s scheme.

 Breaking GEA-Like Stream Ciphers with Lower Time Cost  
  Abstract   
 GEA-1 and GEA-2 are two proprietary stream ciphers used in GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) to protect GPRS from eavesdropping. GEA-2a is an improved version of GEA-2 proposed recently. In this paper, new weaknesses of GEA-like stream ciphers (i.e., GEA-1, GEA-2 and GEA-2a) are discovered and analyzed. As the technical contribution, an automatic algorithm is proposed to search for differential paths of full GEA-like stream ciphers. By this automatic algorithm, the differential paths of full GEA-1, GEA-2 and GEA-2a are found, whose probabilities are up to \(2^{-22.90}\)  , \(2^{-19.60}\)  and \(2^{-18.60}\)  respectively. Based on these found differential paths, practical distinguishing attacks and key recovery attacks on GEA-like stream ciphers in the chosen IV setting are presented. All these attacks have been confirmed by experimental results on a common PC. The cryptanalytic results show that the initializations of all GEA-like stream ciphers are far from being optimal and need to be strengthened.

 SNIPER: Detect Complex Attacks Accurately from Traffic  
  Abstract   
 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is widely acknowledged as a formidable cyberspace danger that may result in critical data leakage and huge losses. Some processes of APT attacks inevitably expose behavioral beacons in traffic, which makes it possible to detect APT attacks from traffic. Unlike deploying attack detectors at end devices or critical servers, anomaly detection at the network entrance provides a larger monitoring field but has to bear a huge traffic load. In addition, traditional approaches focus on specific protocols or scenarios, making dealing with complex and volatile APT attacks difficult. Thus, it is challenging to catch up with the ever-growing high-speed traffic and accurately identify complex attacks from it. In this paper, we present SNIPER, a highly efficient and accurate network-side APT detection system. SNIPER uses a multi-task model to capture more comprehensive characterization information about the traffic. This rich characterization information provides the basis for accurately identifying attack traffic. Then, to avoid the additional overhead of running a large multi-tasking model and to further improve detection speed, SNIPER distills the shared feature layer of the multi-tasking model into a lightweight model for final anomaly detection. With this design, SNIPER can identify much of the activity during an APT attack with extreme accuracy at a rate that matches enterprise traffic. Finally, we evaluate SNIPER on the DAPT dataset, and the result shows that SNIPER surpasses the baseline approach in all metrics, obtaining an F1 score of 0.99.

 From the Perspective of Prototypes: A Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Learning Framework  
  Abstract   
 Federated learning, as a collaborative learning approach that protects user privacy, has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. However, traditional federated learning paradigm generally suffers from two major limitations: ubiquitous reliance on the IID assumption and the homogeneous architecture design of local model and global model. In contrast, prototype federated learning, a personalize federated learning (PFL) paradigm, addresses these heterogeneity problem quite well. However, its original paradigm ignores privacy risks posed by prototype leakage. To prove the risk of prototype leakage, we propose a generative attack method based on conditional generative models, using prototype information to achieve sample reconstruction and theft of training results. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time that prototype information leakage can lead to a series of privacy security issues. Furthermore, We propose a privacy-preserving personalized federated learning framework based on prototypes, ingeniously integrating homomorphic encryption technology into the training of prototype federated learning through equivalent transformations, thus addressing the privacy issue in prototype federated learning.

 Efficient Large-Scale Multi-party Computation Based on Garbled Circuit  
  Abstract   
 Multi-party garbled circuits employ distributed garbling strategy to achieve constant-round secure computation and authentication techniques to resist malicious adversaries. Implementations of these multi-party authenticated garbled circuits are used in constructing payment channels in blockchain and decentralized oracles for TLS. However, the high communication and computation costs limit their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient, large-scale and constant-round multi-party computation protocol based on information-theoretic message authentication code and garbled circuit in the malicious model. Additionally, we propose a novel path-related optimization technique for multi-party authenticated garbled circuit, where parties generate a garbled circuit based on the related path in the circuit rather than the entire circuit. Through experimental evaluation and comparison with related work, the proposed scheme demonstrates dramatic improvement in computation and communication efficiency for each party when the number of parties increases.

 Parallel Implementation of Sieving Algorithm on Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Computing Architectures  
  Abstract   
 Sieving algorithms currently represent the fastest approach of solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP). However, current sieving algorithms exclusively utilize either CPUs or GPUs. This paper introduces a novel sieving approach tailored to CPU+GPU heterogeneous computing platforms. We constructed a runtime system capable of concurrently executing both CPU and GPU versions of the sieving algorithm. The GPU version of the sieving algorithm reduces the demand for graphics memory by efficiently transferring data in batches. We used two computing platforms to evaluate our method: Hannibal is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU; Zeus is equipped with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8176M CPU and two Integrated Matrox G200eW3 Graphics Controllers. The experimental results show that, compared to the classical sieving algorithm implementation in G6K, the proposed method achieves a minimum speedup of 7.2x (for 30-dimensional SVP) and a maximum of 588x (for 120-dimensional SVP) on Hannibal and a minimum speedup of 4.3x (for 30-dimensional SVP) and a maximum of 1230x (for 120-dimensional SVP) on Zeus.

 Unveiling the Efficacy of BERT’s Attention in Memory Obfuscated Malware Detection  
  Abstract   
 The study addresses the challenge of detecting obfuscated malware, particularly memory-obfuscated variants, which evade conventional detection methods by targeting a system’s volatile memory. By leveraging transformer-based models, notably BERT, the research demonstrates promising advancements in malware detection. Through data augmentation and rigorous feature selection processes, the study enhances the CIC-MlMem-2022 dataset, improving its quality for training classification models. Comparative analysis with conventional machine learning techniques highlights the superior performance of BERT and DistilBERT, achieving approximately 74% accuracy in classifying malware families. Notably, BERT exhibits exceptional capability in generalizing to unseen malware, achieving a remarkable 100% success rate in categorizing new families. These findings underscore the potential of transformer-based models for effectively detecting obfuscated malware, emphasizing the need for intelligent detection mechanisms in cybersecurity.

 An eID-Based Privacy-Enhanced Public Transportation Ticket System  
  Abstract   
 The electronic ticketing (e-ticketing) network system has been widely adopted in many countries, offering numerous benefits to public transport authorities and their customers. These benefits include fast and compatible verification processes and mechanisms for replacing lost tickets. Additionally, the system provides security against forgery through cryptographic mechanisms. Most e-ticketing systems use RFID technology to facilitate authentication. RFID-based authentication publishes customer-related sensitive information—e.g., customer location—as temporary data. RFID alone does not adequately address privacy concerns. In this work, we discuss the relevant privacy and security requirements of existing e-ticketing systems and introduce an eID protocol designed to create a privacy-enhanced framework.

 Outsourced and Robust Multi-party Computation with Identifying Malicious Behavior and Application to Machine Learning  
  Abstract   
 This work proposes an efficient n  -party computation framework with malicious security in the outsourced case. We consider a non-symmetrical trust setting that \(n-1\)  parties, including \(P_0\)  , is semi-honest and one party is malicious. Once the party in \(\{P_1,P_2,...,P_{n-1}\}\)  misbehaves, we will caught and exclude it, achieving robustness by executing the further computations among semi-honest parties. Unlike previous works that focused on traditional robustness, we do not need to delegate the computation to an identified honest party, which contradicts the usual expectation of privacy and hinder the adoption in practice. Our framework bridges the gap between semi-honest and malicious honest-majority multi-party protocols, and is well suited for privacy-preserving machine learning. In general, machine learning depends on large amounts of data and powerful computing power, leading resource-constrained clients to resort to secure outsourced computing (SOC) approach. In this work, we utilize the n  -party framework to design efficient building blocks for machine learning. We significantly improve the efficiency of blocks and implement machine learning inference in LAN and WAN setting, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our framework outperforms the existing honest-majority protocols, such as SWIFT (USENIX Security’21) in terms of “robustness” and Fantastic Four (USENIX Security’21) in terms of efficiency.

 Controlled Multi-client Functional Encryption for Flexible Access Control  
  Abstract   
 In Controlled Functional Encryption (C-FE), a policy parameter is introduced during encryption to restrict how the decryptor can decrypt and compute the ciphertext, but C-FE shows certain limitations in complex scenarios involving multiple encryptors participating with their data remaining confidential from each other. To overcome these limitations and leverage the advantages of Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), we extend C-FE, introducing a new primitive termed Controlled Multi-Client Functional Encryption for Flexible Access Control (CMCFE-FAC). This primitive introduces several key innovations: firstly, our CMCFE-FAC scheme combines MCFE to support multiple encryptors, enabling independent encryption and ensuring data privacy and security. Secondly, CMCFE-FAC combines attribute-based mechanisms to support dynamic access control, expanding traditional access control policies and enhancing their flexibility. Thirdly, we formalize the definition and security model for CMCFE-FAC, propose a CMCFE-FAC scheme tailored for the inner product function, and demonstrate the scheme’s security based on the DBDH assumption. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results are provided to illustrate its effectiveness and security.

 A Secure Incentive Mechanism in Blockchain-Based Mobile Crowdsensing  
  Abstract   
 With the widespread popularity of smart devices in recent years, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) as a new appealing data collection paradigm has gained attention in urban monitoring, traffic prediction and social networks, which deploys on decentral terminals for contribution from mobile devices of a large number of participants or crowdsensing nodes. However, traditional MCS systems are mainly based on integrated server development, which cannot fully guarantee their reliability in reality. In addition, the incentive phase of MCS is usually performed under clear-text conditions, it is easy to link the real identity of the nodes with the completed tasks. Therefore, nodes might be unwilling to participate in sensing tasks due to concerns about possible privacy leakage and lack of fair incentives. In addressing the issue of security in corwdsensing, in this work, we propose a privacy-preserving incentive mechanism in blockchain-based mobile crowdsensing systems. It applies blind signatures and zero-knowledge proofs to empower users to update their reputation and receive remuneration for contributing data without divulging the specifics of their individual contributions. In addressing the issue of equitable incentivization, we design an incentive mechanism that distributes rewards fairly based on their contributions, and provide a reputation quantification model to update participants’ reputations reasonably. Finally, we design a reputation-based consensus node selection mechanism to constrain the behavior of consensus node. The experimental results indicate that the reputation quantitative model were in line with our expectations.

 A Comparative Analysis of Phishing Tools: Features and Countermeasures  
  Abstract   
 Phishing is a form of social engineering attack in which targets are contacted by email by someone posing as a legitimate sender to lure the target into sending them sensitive information, such as login information, credit card details, or other personal information. There are a large number of methods to perform phishing attacks, with one of the most common being website-based phishing attacks. These are attacks in which targets are lured to a website that seems to be legitimate but is a fraudulent webpage that steals all the submitted information. There are several tools that can be used for these phishing attacks, e.g., Social Engineering Toolkit (SET), Zphisher, and GoPhish. These tools set up fake websites for phishing and collect login information from the targeted users who are fooled by the legitimate website. This paper presents the method for performing a phishing attack using these three tools and compares the application of these tools to launch phishing attacks and campaigns. We specifically select these three tools because they are free and provide a good platform to create or mimic legitimate websites and use this to launch phishing campaigns to get confidential information. The comparative assessment is performed based on criteria such as GUI, integration with Windows and Linux, report generation, multiple phishing campaign, extracting victim system and browser details. The evaluation shows that GoPhish satisfies most of the features and is widely used in industry for phishing campaigns and creating cyber awareness.

 OEIBS: A Secure Obfuscation for Encrypted Identity-Based Signatures Scheme in NB-IoT  
  Abstract   
 The Internet of Things (IoT) has become pervasive in various domains and offers unprecedented convenience to society. The Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology is particularly well-suited for deployment in applications such as smart manufacturing, smart homes, and smart cities. However, NB-IoT requires low power consumption and network security, which pose significant challenges. While several cryptographic schemes have been proposed for NB-IoT, most of them are infeasible due to the high computing power required by the nodes. In this paper, we propose a secure obfuscation for encrypted identity-based signatures in NB-IoT. Our approach leverages the high computational power of the IoT gateway to generate an encrypted signature, while ensuring the node’s private key cannot be extracted. We prove that our scheme satisfies the virtual black box (VBB) properties and is secure against attacks by semi-honest gateways. Furthermore, we implement our scheme using the Java pairing-based cryptography library (JPBC) on a laptop and a server, and our experimental results demonstrate the practicality of our scheme in IoT applications.

 Call for Participation: Peace!

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 The International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) in 2025 will take place at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Campus Trondheim, Norway. The 36th event of this series features the topic Sustainable Digital Infrastructures. It is sponsored by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. During the event we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the conference series, which took place in Copenhagen in 1955 for the first time. The evolution of communications, networking and digital infrastructures is driving the digitalization of our society. The immense energy consumption of digital infrastructures and broader implications on the environment trigger the need to embed the sustainability paradigm into the technological development. Sustainable evolution of these technologies is triggered by the influence of computer science and telecommunication, the massive deployment of mobile communications and optics, the success of collaborative networking and social networks, the ever-increasing speed and flexibility of new communication technologies, networks, user devices, and applications, and the ever-changing operational challenges arising from these developments. ITC 36 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. The objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and sustainable IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE, and resilience. ITC 36 covers topics in the areas of: Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization Computer and communication networks, protocols and algorithms Wireless, mobile, ad-hoc and sensor networks, IoT applications Virtualization, data centers, distributed and cloud computing Mobile and personal computing systems Energy-efficient computing systems Real-time and fault-tolerant systems Social networks, multimedia systems, service-oriented architectures and Web services Smart power grids and other cyber-physical systems Emerging technologies Analytical modeling techniques and model validation Workload characterization and benchmarking Performance, scalability, power and reliability analysis Sustainability analysis and power management System measurement, performance monitoring and forecasting Anomaly detection, problem diagnosis and trouble-shooting Capacity planning, resource allocation, run time management and scheduling Quality of service, total cost of ownership and pricing Network Measurements, Big Data and AI Big data analytics and machine learning for network & traffic measurements analysis Application of Big Data frameworks (streaming, batch) to network data Novel or better algorithms for topology discovery, network tomography, etc. Measurement-driven network simulation methodologies Performance models from network measurements Network performance measurements and analysis Traffic & workload modeling, traffic generation techniques User characterization and modeling Quality-of-Service and Quality-of-Experience Application layer measurement methodologies and characterization Traffic classification, evasion and deanonymization Network anomaly detection and diagnosis Measurements for network security and forensics Measurements for privacy quantification, and privacy-preserving measurements Deep learning and foundation models Networking Architectures and Paradigms Software Defined Networking Network Function Virtualization Information and Content-centric networks Named data networking Energy efficiency Network security Programmable data planes Applications of SDN and NFV Network virtualization Wireless and Cellular Networks 5G communications and architectures and beyond Internet of Things Age of information Dynamic spectrum access/cognitive radio Game-theoretic/economic models Green (energy-efficient) wireless communications IEEE802.11x Mesh networks Mobile ad-hoc networks Mobile computing services Radio resource allocation/management Spectrum auctions/management Self-organizing networks Small and ultra-dense cells Scheduling mechanisms Software defined wireless networks Traffic model, characterization and measurements Vehicular communications Wireless multiaccess and communication Wireless sensors  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-11-28

 Welcome to ITC 2024!   
   
 Dear Colleague,  
 We are holding the conference in beautiful San Diego, CA. We have a fantastic program that addresses new test technology challenges that significantly affect today’s electronic products!  
 ITC is the world’s premier conference dedicated to electronics test. This year’s ITC continues with its mission to play a unique role as an information sharing forum,  where the wide range of its offerings allows ITC participants to learn, network and conduct business. This year’s program includes a top-notch technical program, vibrant exhibitors, information-packed tutorials  , interactive technical panels  , three workshops  , as well as the all-important networking that these events can provide. The technical program has been designed to optimize personal interactions on all levels.  
 AI is everywhere, especially at ITC! Our Tuesday keynote and visionary talks are great examples where industry leaders will discuss AI. We also have an AI track comprising 4 papers sessions where speakers will address machine learning and AI in test. Our supporter presentations also will address test in the age of AI, as will two of our tutorials.  
 This year’s program will include papers from a pool of impressive submissions and solicited papers. Of these submissions, a large number will focus on AI, automotive, memory, and hardware security. In complement to the paper presentations, there will be special sessions on hardware security certification, chiplet integration, silicon lifecycle management, computing in memory, as well as design and test of high-power compound devices and quantum electronics.  
 We are continuing and expanding on the inclusion of the Industrial Practice papers sessions as ITC has a very strong focus on industry practice as well as industry and academia advances.  
 ITC 2024 features a vibrant exhibition  showcasing relevant companies. The exhibition will serve as a convenient one-stop-shop for all the elements of test technology.  
 This year’s live event will enable us to embrace all of the features of the conference such as personal interaction and networking. The ITC Grand Reception will be held Tuesday evening.  
 Last, but not least, I would like to recognize the enormous efforts of the multitude of dedicated volunteers who made ITC possible by donating their time, expertise, and enthusiasm. Without their hard work and dedication, ITC would not be possible. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to join our exciting team in the future.  
 ITC is the premier event for networking, where professionals from all over the world converge to sharpen skills, exchange ideas and do business. Join us, throughout the conference, for networking activities and to unwind.

 Welcome  
 It is our privilege to welcome you to the International Test Conference (ITC) sponsored by IEEE and the IEEE Philadelphia Section. ITC is the world’s premier conference dedicated to electronics test. Our volunteer committees worked very hard to provide to you an exciting event with a balance of the latest research, practical applications, and networking opportunities.  
 Our topics include many disciplines related to research and industrial practices related to electronics test and related areas.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The Best Paper Award has been renamed, the ITC  Ned Kornfield Best Paper Award in honor of Dr. Nathanial “Ned” Kornfield, ITC’s founder and longtime Chairman Emeritus.  
 To encourage excellence in its technical program, ITC  presents awards to authors of outstanding papers presented at ITC  and published in the proceedings. In determining award-winning papers, the ITC  Awards Selection Committee considers the quality of the papers as published in the Proceedings and as presented at the conference technical sessions. The committee’s decisions are based on responses by conference attendees as recorded on session rating cards and on the observations and recommendations of the ITC  Program Committee.  
 Visit the Awards Page  for a list of past ITC  Ned Kornfield Best Paper Award winners.

 STEERING COMMITTEE    PROGRAM COMMITTEE      
 International Test Conference, the cornerstone of TestWeek™ events, is the world’s premier conference dedicated to the electronic test of devices, boards and systems-covering the complete cycle from design verification, test, diagnosis, failure analysis and back to process and design improvement. At ITC  , test and design professionals can confront the challenges the industry faces, and learn how these challenges are being addressed by the combined efforts of academia, design tool and equipment suppliers, designers, and test engineers.  
 ITC  : A Forum for Exchange… The Harbinger of Change  
 In 1970, engineers facing the test challenges posed by the then-novel semiconductor memory device organized a symposium on IC testing. That meeting at the Rickshaw Inn in Cherry Hill, NJ drew a crowd of 147 people. That symposium is now a week-long conference attended by more than 2,000 engineers from around the world including sister ITC conferences in India and Asia.  
 In its fifty year history, International Test Conference has become the world’s leading electronics test conference . No other industry has changed as much – or changed the world as much – in those fifty years as semiconductor technology. ITC  has kept pace, always seeking to develop new and innovative ways to fulfill its primary objective: the exchange of technical information.

26. Conference ITCS_0:
Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science 2025  
 The 16th Annual Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference will be held at Columbia University in New York City on January 7 - January 10 2025.  
 Registration  
 Please register at the eventbrite registration page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/itcs-conference-2025-registration-1080490659649  Registration is open until December 31  , and we ask that you register as soon as possible. If you don't register by this deadline, you may not be given access to campus in time for the conference.  
 The registration fee is $250 for students and postdocs, and $350 otherwise. Students and postdocs who need assistance can write to the local organizers (email at the bottom of this page) to request a waiver. If you'd like to apply for a waiver, please do so before December 15th.  
 When you register, the first time you are asked to give your name, please give the name as it appears on your government ID. You may need to show this ID to access Columbia campus. After the payment step of registration, there is a final page where you will be asked for the name you want to appear on your badge, which may be different.  
 Hotels  
 We generally recommend staying at a hotel in the Upper West Side neighrbood of Manhattan, from which one can easily get to Columbia campus using the 1 train subway line. The station at 116 St is right next to the campus entrance gate.  
 We have reserved a block of rooms at a discounted rate at the Hotel Belleclaire which can be booked here  . There is a limited number of rooms available, so please be sure to book soon.  
 Conference Venue  
 The talks and all other events will be held in the Columbia Computer Science Building, which can be accessed from the 4th floor of the Mudd Building.

 To get to the Mudd building, first enter campus at the main gate at the intersection of Broadway and West 116 street. It is right next to the 116 st subway station of the 1 train. From there, walk north through campus, up the big staircase, and walk to the Mudd Building.

 Getting to Columbia and around New York  
 Columbia and the Upper West Side are accessible by public transportation from all the NY-NJ airports (LGA, JFK & EWR). The best way to get around the city is to use New York subways and buses, although taxis, Ubers and Lyfts are also easily available from all three airports. LGA airport is the closest of the three airports to Columbia, and the M60 bus goes directly from all the terminals at LGA airport to Columbia campus. We recommend using the Google Maps app to determine how to use public transit to get to around the city, as the system is quite large and often complicated.

 Submission Instructions  
  Authors should register and submit their paper via hotcrp submission site  , by the above strict  deadlines. The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements. Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.  
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.  In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.) The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc.  
 Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims. In addition, it is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.  
 Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and the discussion remain confidential from the authors.  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
  
 Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions  
  Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.  
 Online posting  
  Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arxiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.  
 Accepted papers  
  All the talks are expected to be in person. The talks in the conference will not be recorded, and instead the authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.  
 Graduating bits  
  Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the "Graduating bits" session. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and not to be missed! Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.  
 Awards  
  The committee may award a "best student paper" award.  
 Code of Conduct  
  ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment, including unwelcome advances or propositions of an intimate nature, particularly when coming from a more senior researcher to a less senior one. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates ( http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/  )  
 Proceedings  
  The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference. To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive.

 ITiCSE 2025 (30 June-2 July, Netherlands)  

 Welcome to the 30th annual ACM  conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). ITiCSE conference is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computing Education (SIGCSE)  , in collaboration with the ACM Europe Council  , and Informatics Europe  . ITiCSE 2025 will take place in Radboud University, Netherlands.  
 Call for Participation    

 Welcome to Nijmegen   
 Nijmegen is a city in the east of the Netherlands. It is located close to the German border, and at the same time very well-connected with both the Dutch capital Amsterdam and the nearby national airport.  
 Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, with a city center full of important historical locations. Nijmegen was founded by the Romans as an important base because of its strategic location. The city of Nijmegen is exciting, interesting, and has a turbulent history.  
 And it’s not just a rich cultural history that Nijmegen has to offer. Nijmegen is a lively city with many cozy restaurants, bars and terraces that give the city a young vibe. Furthermore, you can find examples of modern architecture. For instance, a spectacular water management project ‘Room for the River’ was completed a few years ago, involving a change of the course of the river and the creation of an artificial island.  
 Conference venue   
 The ITICSE 2025 conference will take place at Radboud University. The green campus of the university is located outside the city center of Nijmegen and is easily accessible by bike or public transport. Radboud University is a broad university where research and education go hand in hand. Students and staff members feel connected to each other, to society, and to the world around them. For the conference, we are happy to welcome you at the Faculty of Science, in the modern Huygens Building.

Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.

 History  
   
 The ITP conference series is dedicated to interactive theorem proving and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification security, and formalization of mathematics. The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11 to 14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9 to 21 July 2010). ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.  
 The TPHOLs Conference Series  
 TPHOLs 2009 was the twenty-second in a series of international conferences on the applications of higher-order logic theorem proving. The first three (two at Cambridge and one at Århus) were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Between 1991 and 1995 (Davis, Leuven Vancouver, Malta, Utah) the conference entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.  
 The evolution resulted in the program committee for the meeting in Turku (1996) deeming that the scope of the conference included all reasoning tools for higher-order logics and adopting the name TPHOLs, an acronym for Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics. (The final letter was considered necessary to break the direct connection between the conference and the HOL system.) This decision was strongly endorsed at the business sessions at Turku and Murray Hill (1997).  
 Traditions  
 A long-standing convention is that the annual conference should be held in a continent different to the location of the previous meeting. Another tradition is that the organizers for each meeting handle all aspects of the conference for the whole year in consultation with the previous few organizers. This includes selection of the program committee, editing the proceedings fund-raising, program, and local arrangements. Another responsibility of the organizers in year n  is to call for bids and conduct a poll for the selection of the venue for the conference in year n  + 1.

 Call for Participation  

 Participate in ITiCSE 2025!  
 We warmly invite colleagues from around the world to present their work through the submission of papers, working groups, panels, posters, and tips, techniques, & courseware. The conference provides an environment for sharing, exchanging, and discussing new ideas related to computing education, at all levels of instruction. ITiCSE will also host a doctoral consortium.  
 ITiCSE 2025 will be an in-person conference. There will not be facilities for either presenters or audience to attend virtually. In line with SIGCSE conference policy, at least one author of each paper, poster, and tips, techniques, & courseware, and all members of working groups, panels, and the doctoral consortium, are required to attend the conference and to present and discuss their contribution.  
 Each type of submission is described briefly on this page, and in more detail on its own page.  
 Policies  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc  ), including the policy on research involving human participants and subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Please also review the ACM authorship policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship  ).  
 See the ITiCSE policies page ( https://iticse.acm.org/policies/  ) for more information on these and other relevant policies.  
 Ethical status of data collection  
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.

 * Paper submission requires a mandatory submission of an abstract of up to 250 words by an earlier deadline.   Submissions to ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing. ITiCSE generally does not accept papers about applications of computing technology in education generally or in other specific areas of education, such as the development of software to make it easier for students to learn chemistry.  
 Submissions in the Paper category are to be anonymous, for dual-anonymous review. Anonymity is not required for any of the other submission types.  
 Call for submissions  
 Submissions may describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or a tool used for computing education or computing education research.  
 Within the domain of computing education, submissions will cover specific educational subject matter, including but not limited to:  
 pedagogies for enhancing learning in computing subject areas, such as programming, database systems, physical computing, or computer security; 
  leveraging data and analytics to improve learning; 
  use of technologies with specific application to computing education; 
  approaches to peer learning and novel educational methods; 
  social and global challenges in computing education; 
  broadening participation and diversity; 
  developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses; 
  approaches to group work or class infrastructure; 
  teacher skills, teacher education, and teacher professional development. 
  Call for papers  
 An ITiCSE paper is a document up to six pages long, with a seventh page available for references if required. Submissions will fall into one of three categories, each having a dedicated submission track with specific expectations for papers in that track.  
 Computing education research: | papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; 
  Position papers and proposal | s: papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages. 
  The submission deadline for abstracts is one week before the final submission. It will not be possible to submit a paper if the abstract is not submitted by the abstract submission deadline.  
 For more detail see the Papers page  , and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for working groups  
 An ITiCSE working group is an intense collaboration between five to ten researchers from around the world to produce a high-value report on a topic of interest in computing education. The work is conducted remotely before and after the conference, and in person for the three days immediately preceding the conference itself. The working group report is subjected to rigorous review. Accepted working group reports are published well after the main conference proceedings. A working group begins with a proposal by up to three leaders. The proposals are reviewed by the working group chairs, who decide which proposals can proceed to recruit members.  
 For more details see the Working groups  page, and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for panels  
 A panel is a discussion among nominated panelists on a specified topic, typically occupying a 60-minute session, with at least a third of that time allocated for audience participation. A panel submission is a two-page document including a succinct summary of the different perspectives of the proposed participants, in a form suitable for inclusion in the proceedings. The submission must include the authors’ names.  
 For more detail see the Panels page  , and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for posters  
 A submission for a poster is a one-page paper. It is expected that this will include title, authors, abstract and keywords, with the rest of the page consisting of an extended abstract. The nature of the content will vary from poster to poster, but is expected to describe the main topic of the poster and to include references as appropriate. The submission must include the authors’ names.  
 For more detail see the Posters page,  and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for tips, techniques, and courseware  
 A two-page submission for tips, techniques, and courseware will be a summary description of a tip, technique, or courseware to be demonstrated in a conference session. It will be in a form suitable for inclusion in the proceedings. The submission must include authors’ names.  
 For more detail see the Tips, techniques, and courseware  page ,  and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for doctoral consortium participation  
 The doctoral consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral candidates studying computing education to explore and develop their research interests in a workshop environment with a panel of established researchers in the field. This is an excellent opportunity to get feedback on a research topic, or ideas on future direction, from senior researchers in the field.  
 For more detail see the Doctoral Consortium  page, and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 General submission details  
 Be sure that your submissions abide by the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  .  
  
  Be sure when making a submission to EasyChair submission platform that all authors are included. The ACM and ITiCSE are not generally receptive to changes in the author list once a submission has been accepted.  
 Documents submitted for review should be high quality, unpublished, original work. The official language of the conference is English, and submissions for review should be written in good academic English. The entire proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Note that reviewers will assume they are reviewing completed works, as they will eventually appear in the conference proceedings. Do not submit incomplete drafts!  
 Page limits and deadlines for submissions are dependent upon the category of submission.  
 Electronic submission is required. All submissions must be PDF files. Where anonymous submissions are required, please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the PDF file.  
 Formatting requirements  
 All submissions must adhere to the ITiCSE 2025 formatting instructions. Templates for submissions can be found at the ACM SIG Proceedings website  .  
 The proceedings page incorporates two different approaches: the existing templates and the new workflow model. Please note that the new workflow model is “for specified conferences only” and ITiCSE 2025 is not one of the specified conferences  . Submitting authors are required to use the existing templates: for Word authors, the ‘Interim template’; for LaTeX authors, acmart.cls version 2.00 as updated in November 2023, or a more recent update if provided, with the sigconf option. A LaTeX template can also be found on Overleaf  . If you find that the template is producing a single-column format, it is likely that you are not using the sigconf option. A command near the beginning of your file should read \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}   
 The interim Word template is not generally considered easy to use, and it can be difficult to coerce it to produce a paper that conforms to the requirements. Authors who use Microsoft Word should be prepared for a significant challenge in getting an accepted paper to conform with the requirements ready for inclusion in the proceedings. Some authors have decided that it is easier to (re)learn LaTeX and use the LaTeX template on Overleaf than to fight with the Word template.  
 The template permits various forms of draft document. Please do not  use a form that overlaps a watermark with the text of the paper, as this makes the text very difficult for some people to read. In addition, if you use any form other than the expected two-column format, you will still be expected to conform with the specified page limits, as we have no clear way of estimating the properly formatted size of a submission that is not formatted as specified.  
 Submission process  
 Caution:  Submitting the paper abstract is not as simple as uploading a file and clicking ‘Submit’. The review process requires a great deal of information in order to ensure that your submission receives the best possible review, and that information is gathered at the time of first submission. Authors are advised to allow at least half an hour when first submitting the paper.  
 If submitting a full paper, think carefully about which of the three tracks it belongs in. There is no process for shifting submissions between tracks: submissions will be reviewed by the guidelines of the track to which they are submitted, and if they do not fit well in that track, they are unlikely to be favourably reviewed.  
 Before making a submission, please be ready with the email addresses of all co-authors; when making the submission, please take particular care when entering the addresses. Email addresses are required, and every invalid email address — even for a non-corresponding author — generates a bounce message sent to the ITiCSE chairs. Please take the time to avoid this.  
 To submit your work, follow the link to the EasyChair submission page:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iticse2025    
  (EasyChair will be opened in the beginning of December)   
 If you don’t already have an account, you will be prompted to create one. After logging in, you will find a submission form that requires you to enter the type, title, and abstract of your submission, plus contact information for all authors. The PDF file may be uploaded at the same time, or later. Both the information and the file may be updated at any time until the submission deadline.  
 You and all of your co-authors will receive email messages confirming the submission. Spam filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages, so you may need to check your spam trap for confirmation and for any subsequent emails, including your notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior  to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  ( For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after  the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

 Call for Papers  

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the program chairs  .  
 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks   
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  
 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.

 ITS2025  

 ITS2025 is the upcoming Conference of the series of Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conferences on Computer and Cognitive Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning in Tutoring and Education. ITS2025 will be held in Alexandroupolis, Greece, from June 02 to June 06, 2025, and will be co-hosted by Democritus University of Thrace. The conference will be hybrid and it will allow participants to attend it online too    

 NEWS  

 Dear ITS friends the ITS2025 CALL FOR PAPERS    is now OPEN!  

 THEME OF THE CONFERENCE  

 The ITS2025 Conference is about “  Generative Systems   ”.    
   
 ITS is evolving to a new concept of Artificial Intelligence which can be found in various disciplines and can serve human education and well-being. This new concept is named: GENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE. Generative Intelligence concerns various AI systems, techniques, architectures, methods, or tools based on deep and machine learning which can be used to generate texts, images, solutions, and environments, able to enhance HUMAN intelligence, cognitive capacities, memory, and learning. Instead of trying to reproduce human behavior or recognize human traits using artificial intelligence techniques or learning analytics, Generative Intelligence provides means to increase human cognitive potential.   
   
 The conference is supported by the following tracks in which the concepts mentioned above contribute to the increase of intelligence. Each track includes (but is not limimted to) a list of topics of interest which can be found below. Submitted papers should refer to one of the corresponding tracks.   
   
 Conference tracks   
   
 T1: Generative Tutoring Systems   
 T2: Generative Systems in Healthcare Informatics   
 T3: Generative Systems in Human Interaction, Games and Virtual Reality   
 T4: Neural Networks and Data Mining   
 T5: Generative Systems and Metaverse   
 T6: Security, Privacy, and Ethics in Generative Systems

 ITS2025  

 ITS2025 is the upcoming Conference of the series of Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conferences on Computer and Cognitive Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning in Tutoring and Education. ITS2025 will be held in Alexandroupolis, Greece, from June 02 to June 06, 2025, and will be co-hosted by Democritus University of Thrace. The conference will be hybrid and it will allow participants to attend it online too    

 NEWS  

 Dear ITS friends the ITS2025 CALL FOR PAPERS    is now OPEN!  

 THEME OF THE CONFERENCE  

 The ITS2025 Conference is about “  Generative Systems   ”.    
   
 ITS is evolving to a new concept of Artificial Intelligence which can be found in various disciplines and can serve human education and well-being. This new concept is named: GENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE. Generative Intelligence concerns various AI systems, techniques, architectures, methods, or tools based on deep and machine learning which can be used to generate texts, images, solutions, and environments, able to enhance HUMAN intelligence, cognitive capacities, memory, and learning. Instead of trying to reproduce human behavior or recognize human traits using artificial intelligence techniques or learning analytics, Generative Intelligence provides means to increase human cognitive potential.   
   
 The conference is supported by the following tracks in which the concepts mentioned above contribute to the increase of intelligence. Each track includes (but is not limimted to) a list of topics of interest which can be found below. Submitted papers should refer to one of the corresponding tracks.   
   
 Conference tracks   
   
 T1: Generative Tutoring Systems   
 T2: Generative Systems in Healthcare Informatics   
 T3: Generative Systems in Human Interaction, Games and Virtual Reality   
 T4: Neural Networks and Data Mining   
 T5: Generative Systems and Metaverse   
 T6: Security, Privacy, and Ethics in Generative Systems

      SUBMISSION    
 The ITS2025 Conference invites submissions to be presented and discussed during the Conference. All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to or published in any other journal or conference. Papers should be submitted refering to a precise conference track.  
 The following categories are welcome: Full papers – twelve (12) pages, Short papers – eight (8) pages, Posters – six (6) pages.  
 All paper submissions should be made through the Easychair platform  .  Paper submissions should be in PDF  and in English   .  
 To facilitate the uploading of your paper (s) on the Easy Chair platform, please click here  : To be upload.    
 In order to increase high-quality papers and independent merit, the evaluation  process of papers is double-blind  . All papers submitted for review MUST not contain the authors’ names, affiliations, or any information that may disclose the authors’ identity (this information is to be restored in the camera-ready version upon acceptance). Authors should replace names and affiliations with Xs on submitted papers. In particular, in the version submitted for review, they should avoid explicit auto-references, such as “in [1] we show” — consider “in [1] it is shown“; i.e. they may cite previous works, provided that they are not deducible from the text that the cited works belong to the authors. When citing their previous work, they should keep the names with Xs.

 Alexandroupolis Info  

 Alexandroupolis is a Greek city in Greece and the capital of the Evros regional unit. It is the largest city in Greek Thrace and the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, with a population of 71,751, and is an important port and commercial center for northeastern Greece.   
 Alexandroupolis benefits from its position at the centre of land and sea routes connecting Greece with Turkey. Landmarks in Alexandroupolis include the lighthouse in the port, the archaeological sites of the Mesimvria Zone, the city’s waterfront (the centre of commercial activity), the Ethnological Museum of Thrace, the thermal springs (Hana) of Traianoupoli, the cave of the Cyclops Polyphemus and the nearby Evros delta.   
 Alexandroupolis is accessible by air, rail, road and ferry. It has an international port, the A2 Egnatia Odos  motorway, the airport “Dimokritos” and a railway connection with other cities. There are cycle lanes in the city centre.   
 Airport   
 Alexandroupolis is served by Dimokritos International Airport (IATA:AXD) in the suburbs of Apalos, about 6 km from Alexandroupolis city center. There are daily flights to Athens, and several days per week flights to will begin. The airport is connected to the city by highway, taxi services, and scheduled bus services.

 History of ITP Conference Series  

 The Itp conference series  

 the tphols conference series  

 I TP 2012 is the third conference on Interactive Theorem Proving and related, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and formalization of mathematics.  

 The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11-14 July 2010 in Edinburgh Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9-21 July 2010).  

 ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.    

 TPHOLs 2009 was the twenty-second in a series of international conferences on the applications of higher order logic theorem proving.  
   
 The first three (two at Cambridge and one at Århus) were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Between 1991 and 1995 (Davis, Leuven, Vancouver, Malta, Utah) the conference entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.  
   
 The evolution resulted in the program committee for the meeting in Turku (1996) deeming that the scope of the conference included all reasoning tools for higher order logics and adopted the name TPHOLs, being an acronym for Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics. (The final letter being considered necessary to break the direct connection between the conference and the HOL system.) This decision was strongly endorsed at the business sessions at Turku and Murray Hill (1997).  
   
 An extensive collection of links to various aspects of previous conferences in the series may be found below.  

 associated communities  

 An inspection of the proceedings of recent conferences show that the conference accommodates the user communities of a number of theorem proving systems that support higher order logics. The interested reader is referred to the web sites for the following provers:  

 Abella  - Agda  - ACL2  - Coq  - HOL  - Epigram  - IMPS  - Isabelle  - LEGO  - Matita  - Nuprl  - ProofPower  - PVS  - TPS   

 traditions  

 A longstanding convention is that the annual conference should be held in a continent different to the location of the previous meeting.  
   
 Another tradition is that the organizers for each meeting handle all aspects of the conference for the whole year in consultation with the previous few organizers. This includes selection of the programme committee, editing the proceedings, fund-raising, programme and local arrangements.  
   
 Another responsibility of the organizers in year n is to call for bids and conduct a poll for the selection of the venue for the conference in year n+1.

      ITS CONFERENCES   
 The Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) conference attracts researchers and academics, the industry and the end-users since 1988. It started out as an enthusiastic project by Professor Claude Frasson  and in 2018 celebrates its 30th anniversary at its birthplace in Montreal.  

 The ITS conference series enables, supports and enhances human learning, through an interdisciplinary research approach on Intelligent Systems. By linking together the study of the use of advanced computer technologies and various other themes, such as education, tutoring and etc, the ITS conference series builds the foundation for the evaluation of the use of Intelligent Systems in education, modeling innovative applications of technologies and the adaptation of systems to specific groups of learners.  
 The proceedings of the conferences are published with Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science  .  

      SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   
 ITS papers should be original and not published or submitted to any other journal or conference  .  
  
 The ITS Proceedings are published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  series (LNCS) by Springer.  
   
 All paper submissions  should be made through Springer’s OCS platform  :  Authors should use the only function “submit your abstract” provided by OCS to submit their paper which includes an abstract.

 Call for Working Groups  

 This page provides detailed information about working group submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the working group chairs  .  
 Important dates for working groups  
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right.  
 What is a working group?  
 An ITiCSE working group is an collaborative research project conducted by a team of between five and about ten researchers from around the world to produce a high-value report on a topic of interest in computing education.  
 Before the conference  
 A working group (WG) begins with a proposal written by up to four working group leaders. The proposals are reviewed by the working group co-chairs, who decide which proposals can proceed to recruit members. The selected working groups recruit members through the WG pages on the conference website and by other means.  
 Once applications for the first round of recruitment close, the WG selects their group members from the list of applicants. There is then a short period of negotiation during which the WG co-chairs try to resolve any groups that are oversubscribed or undersubscribed. At this point WGs can begin work on their project. An approximately two week long second round of recruitment follows. The final WG consists of five to about ten researchers, including the WG leaders. The viable groups (ones who have recruited sufficient members) then begin their collaboration and work until the time of the conference.  
 Immediately before the conference  
 On the Thursday preceding the conference (26 June), working group leaders will meet in person with the WG co-chairs for an introduction session. For the next three days, working groups will meet for all-day collaboration and writing. A draft of their final report is to be presented to the working group co-chairs at the end of the third day, Sunday 29 June.  
 During the conference  
 The conference will include a session in which each WG gives a brief presentation of their project. In a break from previous practice, the working groups will not continue their work during the conference; instead, they are encouraged to attend conference sessions.  
 After the conference  
 Following the conference, the WG co-chairs will provide general feedback on the overall direction and scope of the work. Upon receiving the co-chairs’ feedback, the WGs have some time to continue their work and update the report, which is then submitted for rigorous review. Accepted reports are given a few weeks to respond to the reviewers’ suggestions and are then submitted for publication in a supplement to the conference proceedings.  
 Formatting the proposal & practical organisation plan  
 The bullet list below summarizes the requirements for a Working Group proposal. Details follow the list.  
 The proposal uses the same format as used for paper submissions 
  The proposal begins with a | two-page ‘paper’ | with these topics | background and related work 
  goals of the proposal 
  proposed methodology 
  expected deliverables 
  and includes citations 
  The proposal also includes a | one-page appendix | that includes | inclusion criteria for member selection 
  a proposed work-plan 
  estimation of good WG size 
  a discussion of prior WG experience of proposers/leaders 
  1. Proposal  Body  (2 pages)  
 The submission is not anonymous: it must include the authors’ names and affiliations. The remainder of the two-page proposal body should be used to explain the background of the work, the goals, the proposed methodology, and the expected deliverables. This can, and should, read like the beginning of a research paper as the working group should be conducting research.  
 A successful working group proposal will be based on existing literature, and propose meaningful work worthy of a working group effort conducted by a multicultural team. In addition, it should be clear the methodology is appropriate, and the expected results are both reasonable (achievable) and meaningful.  
 Note: The successful proposal can result in two publications: 1) an extended abstract published with the conference papers, and 2) the full final report published after the conference. These two publications should have two different titles (save your preferred title for the full report.) All accepted members are expected to contribute to the shape and direction of the working group and contribute to the extended abstract published at the time of the conference, as well as the final report published after the conference, as per ACM authorship policy.  
 2. Proposal Appendix  (1 page)  
 The proposal appendix is a maximum one page, and should include the following details:  
 Inclusion criteria for member selection, and how the leaders will encourage diversity of membership. The goal of ITiCSE WGs is to create new research collaboration opportunities, especially for people who are not yet well-connected within our community. We encourage WGs to consider at least one early career academic / doctoral student / member with no previous WG experience. 
  Proposed work-plan that includes considerations for different time zones and collaboration technology (and alternatives) and how these choices will support engaged members. 
  Schedule of expected meetings prior to the conference and milestones or other progress points. Leaders are asked to report the WG progress to WG co-chairs on a monthly basis. 
  An estimation of the number of members that can contribute meaningfully to the project. The above-mentioned limit of 5-10 members can be flexible for justified reasons and the group can also be larger. 
  A discussion of proposers/leaders prior WG experience. We expect that at least one of the leaders have attended some prior WG due to the fact that, in the past, “no WG experience among the WG leaders” has been the strongest indicator for issues (and perhaps the final report being rejected). 
  3 Submitting the proposal   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The Full Working Group process   
 The working group process spans about 11 months, including time before and after the conference. The ‘phases’ of work include the following:  
 Proposal | – The proposal process is described above. 
  Call for participation | – Accepted proposals will be published on the conference site. 
  Recruitment | – Leaders of accepted working groups as well as ITiCSE PC and WG Co-Chairs advertise to recruit members. 
  Membership | – WG Co-Chairs set up a web form for applicants to apply to WGs (1st and 2nd choice). In coordination with WG Co-Chairs, the leaders of each WG select members from the applicant pool in two phases based on their inclusion criteria. WG Co-Chairs monitor this process. If there is room in a given WG after the first phase, that WG can complete the group by also inviting applicants that didn’t fit in their first choice. 
  Pre-conference work | – Working groups work during the months prior to the conference according to the work-plan submitted with the WG proposal. 
  On-site work | – There is a kick-off meeting on Thursday before the WGs start and at least one WG leader of each group is expected to attend. In the last three days (Friday to Sunday) before the conference, working groups work at the conference site preparing the preliminary report draft, which is delivered before the main conference starts. 
  Conference presentation | – Working groups present their progress to conference attendees at one of the sessions during the conference. 
  Post-Conference Feedback | – WG Co-Chairs provide feedback and the approval to continue. 
  Post-Conference work | – Working groups continue work to complete the report for about three months and submit the final version. All WG members have the responsibility to continue their contributions to the paper after the conference. Leaders certify which members are eligible for authorship according to the ACM authorship policy before the paper is submitted to review. 
  Review | – The final version is peer-reviewed by at least three external reviewers. The Working Groups are supposed to list at least 10 relevant possible reviewers for their work that have no Conflict of Interest with any of the WG members. 
  Decision | – WG Co-Chairs decide which reports will be published based on detailed reviews. Reports that need major revisions are rejected at this phase. 
  Revisions | – Working Groups respond to reviews to produce and submit camera-ready reports. 
  Publication | – The reports are published.

 Call for Papers  

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the program chairs  .  
 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks   
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  
 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.
