 Call for Papers  
 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
  (PADL 2025)  
 PADL 2025 – : The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages – POPL 2025 (sigplan.org)   
 Denver, Colorado, United States, January 20-21, 2025   
 Co-located with ACM POPL 2025   
 Conference Description  
 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming.  
 Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
  Practical applications of theoretical results 
  New language developments and their impact on applications 
  Declarative languages and software engineering 
  Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
  Practical experiences and industrial applications 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages.  
 PADL 2025 will take place on January 20th and 21st, 2025, as a physical (in-person) event. For each accepted paper at least one author is required to register for the conference and present the paper in person.  
 Important Dates  
 Abstract submission: October 4, 2024 (AoE) 
  Paper submission: October 11, 2024 (AoE) 
  Notification: November 11, 2024 
  Symposium: January 20-21, 2025 
  Submissions  
 PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. 15 pages) and short papers (max. 8 pages) that describe original and previously unpublished research results on  
 complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages, 
  tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages, 
  technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. 
  Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.  
 PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. 3 pages) on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication.  
 Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.  
 All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see  
 Conference Proceedings guidelines | Springer | Springer — International Publisher   
 The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version -for example, details of proofs- may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit.  
 Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
 \usepackage{lineno}  
 \linenumbers  
 The conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Previous PADL proceedings can be found on SpringerLink.  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via EquinOCS (registration is required if you do not have an account): EquinOCS (springernature.com)   
 Distinguished Papers  
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP). The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.

 Call for Papers  
 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
  (PADL 2025)  
 PADL 2025 – : The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages – POPL 2025 (sigplan.org)   
 Denver, Colorado, United States, January 20-21, 2025   
 Co-located with ACM POPL 2025   
 Conference Description  
 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming.  
 Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
  Practical applications of theoretical results 
  New language developments and their impact on applications 
  Declarative languages and software engineering 
  Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
  Practical experiences and industrial applications 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages.  
 PADL 2025 will take place on January 20th and 21st, 2025, as a physical (in-person) event. For each accepted paper at least one author is required to register for the conference and present the paper in person.

 PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. 15 pages) and short papers (max. 8 pages) that describe original and previously unpublished research results on  
 complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages, 
  tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages, 
  technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. 
  Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.  
 PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. 3 pages) on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication.  
 Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.  
 All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see  
 Conference Proceedings guidelines | Springer | Springer — International Publisher   
 The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version -for example, details of proofs- may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit.  
 Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
 \usepackage{lineno}  
 \linenumbers  
 The conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Previous PADL proceedings can be found on SpringerLink.  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via EquinOCS (registration is required if you do not have an account): EquinOCS (springernature.com)   
 Distinguished Papers  
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP). The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.

 Monday, October 14, 2024: Creating DSLs Made Easy  , Saman Amarasinghe   
 Today, applications that require high-performance rely on libraries of hand-optimized kernels, with thousands available across various domains and architectures, while Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and their accompanying compilers remain relatively rare. A well-designed DSL can describe a much wider variety of programs within a given domain than even the most comprehensive library, while also unlocking powerful cross-function and global domain-specific optimizations that hand-optimized kernels cannot achieve. As Hennessy and Patterson emphasized in their Turing Award Lecture, the widespread adoption of Domain-Specific Accelerators depends on the availability of DSLs to fully harness these accelerators' high-performance capabilities. However, building high-performance DSLs is complex and time-consuming, often requiring compiler experts to devote years to development.  
  
 In this talk, I will introduce BuildIt, a C++ framework designed for the rapid prototyping of high-performance DSLs. BuildIt uses a multi-stage programming approach to combine the flexibility of libraries with the performance and specialization of code generation. With BuildIt, domain experts can transform existing libraries into efficient, specialized compilers simply by modifying types of the variables. Moreover, it allows them to implement analyses and transformations without needing to write traditional compiler code. Currently, BuildIt supports code generation for multi-core CPUs and GPUs, with FPGA support coming soon. I will also showcase three DSLs created with BuildIt to highlight its power and ease of use: a reimplementation of the GraphIt graph computing language, the BREeze DSL for regular expressions, and NetBlocks, a DSL for custom network protocol development.</p> Bio:  
 Saman Amarasinghe is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), where he leads the Commit compiler group. Under his leadership, the Commit group has developed a wide range of innovative programming languages and compilers, including StreamIt, StreamJIT, PetaBricks, Halide, TACO, Finch, Systec, GraphIt, Simit, MILK, Cimple, BioStream, NetBlocks, BREeze, CoLa, Shim, AskIt, and Seq. Additionally, the group has created compiler and runtime frameworks such as DynamoRIO, Helium, Tiramisu, Codon, BuildIt, and D2X as well as tools for vectorization like Superword Level Parallelism (SLP), goSLP, and VeGen. Saman’s team also developed Ithemal, a machine-learning-based performance predictor, Program Shepherding to protect programs from external attacks, the OpenTuner extendable autotuner, and the Kendo deterministic execution system. He was also co-leader of the Raw architecture project. Outside academia, Saman has co-founded several companies, including Determina, Lanka Internet Services Ltd., Venti Technologies, DataCebo, and Exaloop. He earned his BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Cornell University in 1988, and his MSEE and Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1990 and 1997, respectively. He is also a Fellow of the ACM.  

 Tuesday, October 15, 2024: Every “Bit” Matters: Fostering Innovation in Deep Learning and Beyond  , Andreas Moshovos   
 Computers are widely utilized across various disciplines. By developing increasingly more powerful and efficient machines, we can foster innovation and have a broad impact across many other communities. This talk overviews our own perspective and approach to enabling more efficient hardware/software stacks for deep learning. It will focus on our most recent efforts to enable more efficient training and inference through datatype learning and the optimized encoding of information during data transfers. Rather than guessing what good datatypes can be (the current state-of-the-art practice), our methods learn them. Further, rather than storing data as-is, our methods efficiently pack them using fewer bits without loss of information. We will also comment on what challenges lie ahead in this specific field.  
 Moving beyond the specific work of our group, I will reflect on how dissemination and funding practices and perspectives impact academic innovation, our growth and wellbeing as researchers and practitioners, and their broader implications for future growth of our community.  
 Bio:  
 Andreas Moshovos along with his students has been answering the question “what is the best possible digital computation structure/software combination to solve problem X or to run application Y?” where “best” is a characteristic (or combination thereof) such as power, cost, complexity, etc. Much of his earlier work has been on high-performance processor and memory system design and it has influenced commercial designs. His more recent work has been on hardware/software acceleration methods for machine learning. He has been with the University of Toronto since 2000, but has also taught at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Northwestern University, University of Athens, and the Hellenic Open University. He was the Scientific Director of the Canadian NSERC COHESA Research Network targeting machine learning optimizations, a consortium of 25+ research groups and industry partners.

 The 10th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT'01), was held in the Barcelona Hilton Hotel. PACT'01 offered a high quality technical program, including three outstanding keynote speakers (Randall D. Isaac, IBM; Justin Rattner and Joel Emer, both from Intel), 26 cutting-edge research papers, and a special session on Work in Progress. It also included workshops on OpenMP, Binary Translation, Memory Access Decoupled Architectures, Compilers and Operating Systems for Low Power, and Ubiquitous Computing. A tutorial on the IBM Research Jalapeño JVM was also included in the technical program.   
 211 delegates attended PACT'01 and its workshops. Out of this number, 146 registered for the main event and 65 delegates registered for "workshops/tutorials only". I would like to thank all delegates for traveling to lovely Barcelona. I hope that the city was able to transmit the charm of its people, monuments and museums.   
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of PACT'01, I would like to thank to everybody who collaborated in its making.  The conference received some funding for student travel grants through generous corporate sponsorship. The hosting university (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya UPC), public institutions and corporations (also provided funds to sponsor the activities of the conference. We gratefully thank them for their generous support.

  About  
 The Student Research Competition (SRC) at PACT 2024 provides a unique opportunity for students to present their research and receive feedback from experienced researchers in the community. This competition allows students to network, improve their presentation skills, and showcase their work to an audience of peers and experts. Both undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate.  
 Eligibility Criteria  
 Participants must be current students (graduate or undergraduate) at the time of submission. An active ACM student membership is required. The competition is divided into two categories:  
 Undergraduate: | Currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree. 
  Graduate: | Currently pursuing a master’s or PhD degree. 
  Call for Papers  
 Submissions should include:  
 Problem and Motivation: | Clearly define the problem and explain the need for a solution. 
  Background and Related Work: | Provide context and relevant references, highlighting how your work differs from existing research. 
  Approach and Uniqueness: | Describe your novel approach to addressing the problem. 
  Results and Contributions: | Present your findings and explain their significance to programming languages and computer science. 
  Submissions must be original and unpublished work. Submissions must be original research that is not already published at PACT or another conference or journal. One of the goals of the SRC is to give students feedback on ongoing, unpublished work. Furthermore, the abstract must be authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make clear what the student’s role was and should focus on that portion of the work.  
 Participation  
 The SRC consists of three rounds:  
 Paper Round: | Submissions are reviewed by a committee. 
  Poster Round: | Accepted students present their posters to judges and attendees. 
  Presentation Round: | Selected students from the poster round give a final talk to judges. 
  Awards  
 Three winners from each category (undergraduate and graduate) will receive cash prizes ($500, $300, $200) and an award medal. The top students are invited to participate in the ACM Grand Finale.

 Call for Papers  
 PACT 2024 will be held in Long Beach, California, USA  , during October 13–16, 2024.  
 Submissions due: April 1, 2024   
 PACT 2024 includes a New Call for Tools and Practical Experience Papers   
 Scope  
 The International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique technical conference sitting at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on parallelism. The PACT conference series brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications, to present and discuss their latest research results.  
 PACT 2024 will be held as an in-person event in Long Beach, California, USA. At least one of the authors of accepted papers will be required to attend the conference, and we encourage all the authors to participate.  
 Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Parallel architectures, including accelerator architectures for AI or other domains 
  Compilers and tools for parallel architectures (as above) 
  Applications and experimental systems studies of parallel processing 
  Computational models for concurrent execution 
  Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures 
  Compiler and hardware support for hiding memory latencies 
  Support for correctness in hardware and software 
  Reconfigurable parallel computing 
  Dynamic translation and optimization 
  I/O issues in parallel computing and their relation to applications 
  Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications 
  Middleware and run time system support for parallel computing 
  Application-specific parallel systems 
  Distributed computing architectures and systems 
  Heterogeneous systems using various types of accelerators 
  In-core and in-chip accelerators and their exploitation 
  Applications of machine learning to parallel computing 
  Large scale data processing, including computing in memory accelerators 
  Insights for the design of parallel architectures and compilers from modern parallel applications | PACT for Quantum and Neurmorphic 
  Neuromorphic computing both as an application for and a tool applied to architectures and compilers 
  Quantum computing architectures and compilers. 
  In addition to the regular research papers, PACT 2024 has a special category of papers called “tools and practical experience” (TPE). Such papers are subject to the same page length guidelines and will be reviewed by the same Program Committee. TPE papers focus on applicability (such as traditional methods employed in emerging fields), exposing challenges and experiences the industry is facing as an opportunity to steer the research. A TPE paper must clearly explain its functionality, provide a summary about the practice experience with realistic case studies, and describe all the supporting artifacts available (if relevant). The selection criteria are:  
 Originality: Papers should present PACT-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in PACT-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: Preferences will be given to tools or compilers that are freely available (at either the source or binary level). Exceptions may be made for industry and commercial tools that cannot be made publicly available for business reasons. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Submitting your work  
 Paper submissions are due April 1, 2024  by posting on the conference submission site  . Please make sure that your paper satisfies all the following requirements before being submitted. Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines will be rejected by the submission system and/or subject to an administrative rejection.  
 Mark TPE papers clearly by preceding their title with “TPE: ” both in the submission site and in the submitted pdf 
  The paper must have an abstract under 300 words. 
  The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. You may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  The submission is limited to ten (10) pages in the ACM 8.5” x 11” format (US letter size paper), double column (e.g., using the sigconf LaTeX template style), using 9pt font, with no more than 7 lines per inch. This page limit applies to all content NOT INCLUDING references, and there is no page limit for references. Your paper must print satisfactorily on both Letter paper (8.5”x11”) and A4 paper (8.27”x11.69”). The box containing the text should be no larger than 7.15”x9” (18.2cm x 22.9cm). Templates are available on the | ACM Author Gateway | . 
  Paper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include author names, institutions or hints based on references to prior work. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending someone else’s research. We realize that for some papers it will still reveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these guidelines, the submission will not be penalized. 
  Anonymized supplementary material may be provided in a single PDF file uploaded at paper submission time, containing material that supports the content of the paper, such as proofs, additional experimental results, data sets, etc. Reviewers are not required to read the supplementary material but may choose to do so. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We suggest that you use only the four widely used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. 
  Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but may not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered for posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the poster session should indicate this in their abstract submission. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 Please submit your work via the conference submission site  .  
 Conflicts of interest  
 Authors must identify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external members of the community. We ask all  authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts at the submission site. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or game the review system, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts of interests are defined according to ACM’s conflict of interest policy  .  
 Artifact evaluation  
 Authors of accepted PACT 2024 papers are encouraged to formally submit their supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess the availability, functionality, and reproducibility of the work and experimental results described in the paper. Submission is voluntary. We strongly encourage authors to consider submitting artifacts for their work, including simulators for new architectural designs and extensions.  
 We encourage authors to prepare their artifacts for submission and make them more portable, reusable and customizable using open-source frameworks including Docker  , OCCAM  , reprozip  , CodeOcean  and CK  .  
 Papers that successfully go through the Artifact Evaluation process will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of such papers will have an option to include their Artifact Appendix to the final paper (up to 2 pages). Authors are also encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available.  
 Camera ready instructions  
 Page limit  
 The final version of the accepted paper should not exceed 11 pages, with the provision of an additional 2 pages specifically allocated for the artifact appendix, if applicable. It is important to note that these 2 extra pages should be used exclusively for the artifact appendix and nothing else. The page limit applies to all content except the references section. Additionally, authors have the option to purchase up to 2 extra pages at a rate of $200 USD per page. Payment for these additional pages should be made during the conference registration process through the conference registration system  
 Copyright Forms  
 Contact authors will receive an email from the ACM e-rights system. Please be on the lookout for this email and make sure you respond (fill the associated form) within 24 hours from getting it.  
 Uploading  
 Contact authors will receive an email from the ACM e-rights system once they submit the copyright. Please upload the camera-ready version of your paper through TAPS. Note that the camera-ready paper should follow the template available on the ACM Author Gateway.

  ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects 

 ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  

 ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects      
 Approved by ACM Publications Board on August 15, 2021      
 Background     
 ACM is committed to protecting the rights and welfare of all individuals participating in computing research. Research involving human participants and subjects raises ethical concerns regarding informed consent, risks to participants and subjects, and potential coercion. In many countries and jurisdictions around the world such research is subject to regulations, including regulations requiring review by a review board prior to conducting such research.    
 While many of these regulations were first developed to govern medical research, such as the Declaration of Helsinki  , they have generally been extended to include behavioral research, including some research in computing. While these regulations generally derive from the same principles, they differ in terms of which research is covered and in the specific review processes and criteria employed.    
 In developing this Policy, ACM carefully reviewed The Belmont Report  and derived many of the same principles as identified and explained in this report.    
 In recent years, it has become common for research publications to have policies governing research with human participants and subjects and to require researchers engaged in such research to make declarations, prior to publication, that they have acted in accordance with both ACM’s Policy and any local or governmental laws and regulations governing their research.    
 Furthermore, in addition to Primary Publishers’ developing and ratifying policies involving human participants and subjects research, many secondary publishers, such as Clarivate and international ethics organizations, like the Committee on Publication Ethics  , have in recent years implemented their own requirements and guidelines for published research that involved human participants and subjects. To the greatest extent possible, ACM aims to comply with these requirements.    
 Reasons for Policy     
 As the number of articles ACM publishes that include research based on human participants and subjects rises, it is a moral imperative that ACM establishes a clear policy setting standards for practice in connection with ACM Publications. Simply put, it is the right thing to do and it is important for all stakeholders in the publication process, including authors, reviewers, editors, program committees, readers, and third parties making ACM publications discoverable to the world to know that any research published in an ACM publication venue can be trusted to be based on ethical research standards and practices.    
 Definition of Human Participant and Subject Research     
 ACM adopts the definition of Human Subjects Research used by the US National Institutes of Health as “Research involving a living individual about whom data or biospecimens are obtained/used/studied/analyzed through interaction/intervention, or identifiable, private information is used/studied/analyzed/generated” (see https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/human-subjects-research-infographic.pdf  )    
 Policy Statement     
 All authors conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research. In particular, ACM authors must ensure that their human research planning, conduct, and reporting are consistent with their local governing laws and regulations and the general principles detailed below. It is important to note that something may not be ethical even though it is not prohibited by local law or regulation, and thus authors should also ensure alignment that their research practices are compliant with the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  and international and national standards for such research, such as The Declaration of Helsinki  , The Belmont Report  , and The Common Rule  , including, but not limited to:    
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies 
  Where such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, Authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles. Authors should also declare any potential conflicts of interest in compliance with the Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  , so that reviewers and editors may determine whether the declared COIs are significant enough to warrant rejection of the Work or another appropriate remedy.    
 Individual ACM Publications, such as an ACM Journal or Conference Proceeding, may specify a more restrictive policy than required by local legal requirements, however, where an individual ACM Publication (i.e. - conference, journal, etc.) implements a more restrictive policy, the requirements for this stricter policy must be clearly communicated in the Instructions for Authors section of that publication’s website and must be included in any and all publicly distributed Calls for Papers for that publication venue, such as for an ACM Conference.    
 Scope of Policy       
 This policy applies to all ACM Publications, including ACM Sponsored, co-Sponsored, or In-Cooperation Conferences, International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) proceedings, journals, magazines, books, newsletters, or any research data or content published in the ACM Digital Library as primary objects.    
 Roles and Responsibilities     
 Authors.  It is the authors’ responsibility (each author individually and the authors collectively) to comply with and provide evidence of compliance with this Policy. Where local ethical review boards are required, authors are responsible for having their research reviewed and approved by such boards. Authors are also responsible for the overall ethical conduct of their research. All ACM Authors must be prepared to provide documentary evidence to ACM that they have adhered to local ethical and legal standards, as ACM may require documentary evidence of such approval at any time following submission of the Work and prior to or after publication of the Work.    
 Editors-in-Chief and Program Committee Chairs.  EICs and Program Chairs are responsible for communicating the existence of this policy to authors. They are also responsible for setting and communicating any publication-specific human subjects research policy, after consulting with ACM Staff and the Chair of the ACM Ethics and Plagiarism Committee, with the requirement that such policies must be no less restrictive than this policy. Editors-in-Chief and Program Committee Chairs are responsible for determining the appropriate mechanisms for ensuring compliance with this policy (including optionally including questions about human participants and subjects research on review forms and requiring submission of any required documentation as part of article submission) and have the ultimate responsibility for determining whether a submission under review should be rejected for violation of this policy.    
 Peer Reviewers.  Reviewers have the opportunity (and if specified by the Editor-in-Chief or the Program Committee Chair, the responsibility) to consider whether human subjects research they are reviewing was conducted ethically and in compliance with local requirements. Such issues may be raised in reviews or directly to the appropriate Editor or Program Committee member.    
 Publications Board Ethics and Plagiarism Committee.  The Publications Board Ethics and Plagiarism Committee is responsible for deciding cases involving alleged violations of this policy in published Works as discussed below. The committee may also be consulted for advice on cases prior to publication by journal EICs or conference Program Committee Chairs.    
 ACM Staff.  ACM Staff is responsible for communication of this policy to authors through the ACM Web site and other author-facing ACM sites, in the ACM Digital Library, ACM SIG sites, and in individual ACM Publications, such as journals, magazines, conference proceedings, books, etc.    
 Violations and Penalties     
 ACM will investigate potential violations of this Policy when receiving a credible claim from a named individual(s) that an ACM author(s) may have violated this Policy. To the greatest extent possible, the identity of claimants shall be kept confidential.    
 When an allegation of potential misconduct relates to an unpublished submission to an ACM journal, magazine, or book, the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Publication will work directly with either the author(s) to ensure compliance with this Policy or will have the obligation to reject the submission.    
 When an allegation of potential misconduct relates to an unpublished submission to an ACM conference or ICPS conference, the Program Committee Chair(s) will work directly with either the author(s) to ensure compliance with this Policy prior to publication in the ACM Digital Library or will have the obligation to reject the submission.    
 When an allegation of potential misconduct relates to a Work already published by ACM in the ACM DL, a determination of whether that work violates this policy shall be made by the ACM Publications Board. ACM Staff will work closely with the Ethics + Plagiarism Committee of the ACM Publications Board to investigate and advise on the case.    
 In the event it is determined that the Policy has been violated and depending on the circumstances and severity of the violation, a Level 2-5 penalty may be assessed, at the sole discretion of the Ethics + Plagiarism Committee or ACM Publications Board, which may include, depending on the severity of the violation a “Note of Concern” on the Work’s citation page or a Retraction of the published Work in the ACM Digital Library, as per ACM’s policy and procedures for retracting Works in the ACM Digital Library and in accordance with ACM’s Penalties for Publication Violations  .

  Abstract:  When performing a Tate pairing (or a derivative thereof) on an ordinary pairing-friendly elliptic curve, the computation can be looked at as having two stages, the Miller loop and the so-called final exponentiation. As a result of good progress being made to reduce the Miller loop component of the algorithm (particularly with the discovery of "truncated loop" pairings like the R-ate pairing [18]), the final exponentiation has become a more significant component of the overall calculation. Here we exploit the structure of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to reduce to a minimum the computation required for the final exponentiation.

  Abstract:  We provide a convenient mathematical framework that essentially encompasses all known pairing functions based on the Tate pairing and also applies to the Weil pairing. We prove non-degeneracy and bounds on the lowest possible degree of these pairing functions and show how endomorphisms can be used to achieve a further degree reduction.

  Abstract:  In implementing an efficient pairing calculation, it is saidthat the lower bound of the number of iterations of Miller'salgorithm is log2r/φ(k),where φ(·) is the Euler's function. Ate pairingreduced the number of the loops of Miller's algorithm of Tatepairing from $\lfloor\log_2r\rfloor$ to $\lfloor\log_2(t-1)\rfloor$. Recently, it is known to systematicallyprepare a pairing---friendly elliptic curve whose parameters aregiven by a polynomial of integer variable "Χ". For thecurve, this paper gives integer variable Χ---basedAte pairing that achieves the lower bound byreducing it to $\lfloor\log_2\chi\rfloor$.

 Abstract :  When performing a Tate pairing (or a derivative thereof) on an ordinary pairing-friendly elliptic curve, the computation can be looked at as having two stages, the Miller loop and the so-called final exponentiation. As a result of good progress being made to reduce the Miller loop component of the algorithm (particularly with the discovery of "truncated loop" pairings like the R-ate pairing [18]), the final exponentiation has become a more significant component of the overall calculation. Here we exploit the structure of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to reduce to a minimum the computation required for the final exponentiation.

 PAKDD Conference Guide  
 The PAKDD Steering Committee provides oversight of the PAKDD series of conferences. Conferences are generally run autonomously, with reference to the steering committee for guidance. The following guidelines aim to capture the common understanding between the sterring committee and the conference organisers.  
  Awards  
  
 A number of awards are presented at the conference dinner as either plaques or certificates. The following suggestions may assist the PC and the organising committee:  
 Two | Student Paper Awards | including complimentary registration for the next PAKDD conference and a $500 (USD) grant to support travel, funded by the PAKDD Steering Committee, selected by the PC. | *Best Paper Award | selected by the PC. This can be split into two awards, one for best research paper and the other for best applied paper or the paper which best demonstrates good research and repeatability (e.g., by making the algorithm available as open source software). A | plaque | is arranged by the local organising committee to be presented. 
  The | Most Influential Paper | Award is selected from the conference 10 years ago by SC (e.g., in 2012 we selected from 2002). The SC chair appoints a selection committee (a chair and two members from the SC) in November each year for the next conference. The SC Chair identifies the paper citations using Google Scholar (an automated counter is available) and this may guide the selection of the committee. The most cited papers are reviewed by the committee for impact, influence, novelty, and significance. Recommendations are presented to the SC in January for endorsement and the conference organisers and winner informed in March so that plaques can be arranged and the recipient can arrange travel for attendance. A | plaque | is arranged by the local organising committee to be presented. 
  The | Distinguished Contribution | Award is selected by a committee of previous recipients of the Award. Once the committee has decided on the recipient, the nomination is presented to the Steering Committee for their endorsement. The recipient is then notified to confirm their attendance at the conference. The conference organisers arrange for a plaque which is presented during the conference banquet by the SC Chair. A | plaque | is arranged by the local organising committee to be presented. 
  The | Student Travel Awards | are funded by the PAKDD Steering Committee to support student authors of accepted papers to help them defray part of the cost of attending the conference to present their work. The Student Travel Awards will be presented in cash to the winners at the conference reception. The amount of award for different winners may be different according to the needs of the applicants and the capacity of the fund. Typically, the amount for each award will be around USD $400 with 10 awards available. The awards are administered by the conference organisers. See | PAKDD 2015 Student Awards | for an example. 
  The plaque used for the major awards is often a golden coloured A4 (297mm x 210mm) plate on a wooden mount.  

  Call for Papers  
  
 The recommended target audiences for placing the call-for-papers include:  
 KDNuggets 
  DBWorld 
  ML List 

  Conference Schedule  
  
 Three and a half days is a good length.  
 The first day is generally for workshops and tutorials. These are run in parallel. Running tutorials in parallel with the main conference presents challenges, so the recommendation is to run them on the first day in parallel with the workshops.  
 The conference reception is often held on the evening of the day of the workshops and tutorials. Many attendees arrive that day. The reception often includes finger food, and often enough to make a light meal, but also allowing attendees to organise themselves to go out for dinner if they desire.  
 The second day is the openning of the main conference, often beginning with a keynote presentation. The evening is often kept clear for participants to make their own arrangements.  
 The second evening is also often the Steering Committee annual general meeting and working dinner, hosted by the conference.  
 The conference organisers will arrange the steering committee meeting and dinner. The meeting runs for 3 hours. The first 90 minutes covers the following agenda for all the SC plus invited guests from the current, previous and future conferences:  
 Opening and welcoming by the SC Chair or Co-Chair 
  Report from previous year’s conference - financial summary 
  Update on the current conference 
  Presentation from the organisers of the next year’s conference 
  Proposal for the next year plus one conference 
  General discussion 
  The remaining time is for the SC only to discuss other items and to make decisions regarding future conferences and SC membership.  
 The next year’s conference decision will be announced at the conference banquet. The conference organiser will also make a presentation at the banquet.  
 The third day is often a half day, with a organised tour for the afternoon, followed by the conference dinnner.  
 The final day is a full day. Finishing the conference with an invited panel session including the invited and keynote speakers can often be a good closing point. Often something like learnings from the conference and where to now. The aim is to bring everyone together for the end of the conference for a wrap up, and to encourage attendees to remain until the end to avoid the slump in attendance for the final few sessions. It also provides a definite end point, rather than simply fading out!  

  Conference Services  
  
 Airport Transportation  
 Transfers to and from the airport can often be organised by the conference and are a welcoming sign to the conference attendees! If other very convenient transfer arrangements are available (e.g., direct link into the local train or bus system and convenient location of a station or stop to the hotel) then that is often adequate and could be clearly noted on the conference web site.  

  Final Programme  
  
 A serious problem is the no-show. Authors have paid their registration to get their paper published, but don’t turn up - they’ve already got what they wanted or else last minute changes of plans have required them not to travel!  
 The main problem here is attendees turning up to a session where only 2 of the 5 presenters have arrived. It looks bad and provides a negative talking point.  
 A simple solution is to delay production of the final progamme as much as possible. Before final printing get confirmation from each author that they can still attend and remove from the programme those who can not.  
 Please also refer to the PAKDD No Show policy on the PAKDD Web Site  and direct authors to this policy so it is very clear what our expectations are and waht actions the conference organisers will take if the rules are breached.  

  Financials  
  
 A $5000 (USD) seed grant is available on application to the PAKDD SC Chair. The seed money is to be repaid to the PAKDD SC at the conclusion of the conference, before any surplus is calculated.  
 If a conference makes a loss (which has not occurred) the PAKDD SC can decide to underwrite that loss up to an amount of only $5000 (USD). If seed money was provided for the conference, the maximum amount of support for any loss will be reduced by the amount of the seed money provided.  
 If the conference ends up raising funds in surplus (the only situation we have had so far) the surplus (after returning any seed money) is split 50/50 with the PAKDD SC. Such funds are only to be used for the benefit of the conferences into the future, in line with the Steering Committee Rules  .  

  Invited Speakers  
  
 PAKDD uses the following process for all invited speakers and especially those for whom financial support is provided e.g., airfare and accommodation). This includes Keynote Speakers, Tutorial Speakers, Summer School Speakers, etc.  
 For Tutorial Speakers, the Tutorial Chair will take care of the standard process. For Keynote Speakers and Summer School Speakers (if there is a Summer School), the General Chairs or Program Committee Chairs will execute the process.  
 The process is:  
 The PC Chairs and General Chairs propose names and also ask the Steering Committee for nominations. 
  The PC Chairs and the General Chairs create the list, and filter out anyone who has been an invited speaker in the past 4 years in PAKDD. The reason for this is to expose the PAKDD community to a diversity of opinions/view/ideas. This also helps to bring PAKDD to the notice of well regarded people outside of the existing PAKDD community, thus increasing its visibility. 
  The PC Chairs and the General Chairs rank the nominated candidates based on (i) their visibility, (ii) relevance of area, (iii) experience in speaking in other forums, etc. 
  The PC Chairs select the top 3 for Keynotes, and 1 for any Data Mining School and send it to the Steering Committee for approval. The Steering Committee can come back to the PC Chairs and the General Chairs with specific advice about exclusions. 
  With the final list approved by the Steering Committee, the PC Chairs invite the speakers. They must be careful not to invite anyone or make promises to anyone before the process has been completed and the Steering Committee approval obtained.

  Locations  
  
 The PAKDD conference series aims to support the emergance of KDD research and technology in the Pacific and Asian regions. The conference locations are spread throughout the region. Whilst there is no explicit rule regarding location the general principle is to move through the region from China, Japan/Korea, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and the Pacific from year to year.  
 The next year’s conference is announced at the current conference’s banquet dinner. Any decision regarding the conference two years hence is not announced nor confirmed until it is only one year hence, when the General Chairs, PCs, and invited speakers are expected to have bene line up.  

  Paper Submission Policy Guidelines  
  
 These guidelines were developed by the PAKDD Organising and Steering Committee in 2007 as a recommendation for adoption by future PAKDD Conference Organisers.  
 PAKDD Paper Submission Policy  
 The scope of PAKDD and the required format and page limitations are indicated in the Call For Papers of PAKDD.  
 The paper must fit the scope of PAKDD. 
  The paper must conform to the required format and page limitations. 
  The paper must be original, and must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere. 
  Plagiarism is unacceptable. | The verbatim copy and/or reuse of material (text, formula, graphics) from other published papers (either by the author or by other authors) without explicit citation, is considered to be plagiarism. Quotations should be clearly identified and include the appropriate citation. For example, “According to Smith and Jones (2007) ‘……’”, or “‘……’ (Smith and Jones, 2007). 
  When a new submission is based on the authors or on another author’s previously published works, the citation of the previous works should be clearly given in the new paper. Furthermore, the novel contribution of the current paper, which extends the previous works, should be clearly indicated. 
  This policy on plagiarism for PAKDD has benefited from the guidelines on how to handle plagiarism statement developed by the IEEE.  
 No-Show Policy  
 PAKDD defines “no-show” as the author (or one of the authors) not being present g at their allocated conference/workshop session for presentation of their paper. PAKDD categorizes no-shows and takes the identified actions as below:  
 Withdrawal, before proceedings are finalised. 
  If none of the authors register for the conference/workshop before the required deadline, prior to the proceedings being finalised, the paper will be deemed as being withdrawn from the conference, and will not be included in the proceedings or the conference program.  
 Good faith no-show, after final program is published. 
  When none of the authors can attend the conference for their paper presentation, due to unforeseen circumstances, the authors MUST inform the PC chairs immediately the situation arises. The authors are required to arrange for a delegate to present the paper at the conference/workshop, and the authors must identify the surrogate presenter to the PC chairs prior to the conference.  
 Bad faith no-show during conference. 
  If the authors fail to inform the conference organiser of their change in circumstances and are not available for the presentation of their paper, the conference will inform the authors’ organization. In addition, if the authors have a record of bad faith no-show with previous PAKDD conferences, the proceedings will not be made available to the authors, and future submissions to PAKDD conferences by the authors will be barred for up to three years.  
 This document was drafted 7 May 2007 by Takashi Washio and reviewed by Jaideep Srivastava. Updated 6 June 2007 by Graham Williams.   

  Proceedings  
  
 The proceedings are published by Springer as part of the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. Alfred Hoffman is the Springer contact and can often best be contacted by phone rather than email.  
 The Steering Committee should be listed in the Organisation section.  
 The workshop proceedings are also published by Springer as part of the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series as a post conference publication. Papers could be available during the workshop to attendees, and the workshop chairs should provide at least an additional review from the workshop presentations. Authors then have an opportunity to resubmit with any small changes for the post conference publication.  

  Program Committee Chairs  
  
 The Steering Committee recommends that a recognised international researcher in data mining be appointed as the Program Committee Chair. Their role is to encourage international participation in the conference and ensures the ongoing credibility and integrity of the conference.  
 Co-chairs will also be appointed by the particular conference organisers. One of the co-chairs will be identified as responsible for the administration of the paper submission and review system.  
 The organisation and program committees for the coming year’s conference should be agreed to by the steering committee, finalised and confirmed by the time the conference is announced at the conference banquet.  

  Proposals  
  
 Proposals for hosting the conference are always welcome and should be sent to the Steering Committee chair or any other member of the Steering Committee for their support and presentation to the Steering Committee.  
 Proposals are considered at the Steering Committee’s annual general meeting hosted by the conference. The bid for the coming year’s conference is considered and the steering committee makes their final decision on which bid to proceed with. This will then be announced at the conference dinner.  
 Proposals for more than just the following year are also welcome and encouraged. This allows the steering committee to review the proposal early and to provide feedback for the final bid.  

  Registration Fee  
  
 A registration fee of approximately USD $550 (early bird) is the target. A student fee of USD $350 (early bird) is also suggested. This covers conference, workshops, and tutorials. For particular locations, the conference organisers may decide to charge a smaller fee for local registrations to encourage local participation. Workshop-only fees (for example USD $180 early bird) may also be appropriate, but we do want to encourage attendees to stay on for the whole conference.  

  Review Process  
  
 Past PAKDD conference have had an acceptance rate from 15% to 30%. Do not exceed 30%. Up to 90 papers is the norm.  
 Conference organisers have conflicts of interest whenever they are also authors of papers. The conference PC chairs must not be an author of any accepted papers. Similarly, tutorial chairs can not submit tutorial proposals and workshop chairs can not submit workshop proposals. Also, conference organisers can not present invited/keynote talks.  

  Session Chairs  
  
 Session charis must be organised prior to the conference and identified in the conference program.  
 Avoid having as a session chair one of the authors of a paper in the session. It tends to make it awkward for the chair to also present a paper.  
 The following may usefully be handed to each session chair. Be sure to remind all speakers during the openning to report to their session 5minutes prior to the session time.  
 Guidance for Chairs of PAKDD Sessions  
 Prior to the beginning of your session:  
 Please check “Program” on the Web Page in advance. Your session may consist of long presentations (20min talk and 5min discussion) and short presentations (12min talk and 3min discussion). 
  Come to the room approximately 5 minutes before your session starts, and check that each speaker is in the room. In addition, confirm the pronunciation of the speaker’s name and affiliation. 
  Ask all speakers to copy their slides into the conference provided computers. 
  If you find any problem with the environment of your session room, please contact our volunteer who is in the room. The volunteer is identified by their name badge and t-shirt. 
  During and after your session:  
 At the beginning of your session, inform the speakers of the times allocated to their talks and discussions according to the conference program booklet. 
  Please keep the session on schedule. You are responsible to maintain the schedule accurately. 
  Please let all speakers use the microphone when it is provided. Please take care of the speakers not to hide the screen from the audience. 
  Remind every speaker their remaining time. The presentation of a long presentation-based paper includes 20min talk and 5min discussion, the presentation of a short presentation-based paper includes 12min talk and 3min discussion. 
  Please take note of “NO SHOW” presentations and inform the registration desk after your session. 
  In case that a presentation ends earlier than the scheduled time or is a “NO SHOW”, you may use the extra time for discussions among the audience and yourself, in order to cater for the schedule for the next presentation. 
  Emergency: | If there is any urgent business, please contact the volunteer at the conference room, or the registration desk. 

  Steering Committee Rules  
  
 The steering must abide by the following rules that can be found here   

  Submission Management Systems  
  
 The Steering Committee, based on feedback from past conferences, recommends the use of the free EasyChair  conference system, which is hosted by the University of Manchester Computer Science Department. Simply register at their web site.  
 The PAKDD 2010 committee has also recommended the use of the free and open source SubSift  for assigning papers to reviewers.  
 Plagiarism is an important issue to be aware of. Papers can be searched for through Google, for example.  
 Please be sure to ask the submitter of a paper whether the paper is a student paper. A student paper would normally have a student as the first author and would register as a student.

 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 PATAT 2022  

 Submitted 4 years 11 months ago by Greet  .   

 Event Location:   
 Irish College  Janseniusstraat 1    
 3000  Leuven  Belgium   
   
 See map: Google Maps    

 BE   

 Date:   
 Tuesday, August 30, 2022  to Friday, September 2, 2022    

 Description:   
 The 2020 silver anniversary edition of PATAT was originally intended to be held by KU Leuven in Bruges (Belgium), but had to be postponed until 2022 in light of the pandemic. The conference will now instead be held in the equally beautiful city of Leuven (Belgium)  , the university's home town, and will run from Tuesday 30th August until Friday 2nd September 2022  . The venue will be the Irish College, which promises to offer the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect, present and discuss on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-seven years as well as to anticipate where we might be headed throughout the coming decades. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by March 23rd 2022  .  
 Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems (e.g., educational timetabling, timetabling in transport, employee rostering, sports timetabling, timetabling in healthcare), timetabling algorithms (e.g., mathematical programming, heuristic search, metaheuristics - Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Ant Colony Methods, hyper-heuristics, machine learning, matheuristics, constraint-based methods, algorithm portfolios, parallel/distributed computing, multi-objective/multi-criteria approaches), foundational/theoretical studies (e.g. complexity issues), timetabling tools and applications, and any optimization issues related to timetabling.  
 A special track is planned, dedicated to the International Timetabling Competitions on University Course Timetabling (ITC 2019) and Sports Timetabling (ITC 2021)  
 We are pleased to announce that the invited speakers who were confirmed in principle for the 2020 edition have agreed, travel restrictions permitting, to deliver plenary talks at the 2022 edition:  
 Celso C. Ribeiro, Computer Science, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 
  Sigrid Knust, Institut für Informatik, Universität Osnabrück, Germany 
  Andrea Schaerf, Polytechnic Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Udine, Italy 
  Deepak Ajwani, School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland 
  Peter Nightingale, Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK 
  We look forward to welcoming you to Leuven where you will be free to sample some of the finest versions of the very best things life has to offer: Belgian chocolate, beer and fries!

 ----------  
 AIM AND SCOPE  
 The International Series of Conferences on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT) is held biennially as the main ,international forum for both researchers and practitioners of timetabling to exchange ideas. PATAT 2024 which is the fourteenth in the ,conference series will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark.  
 Whether it is sporting events, educational institutions, transportation or employee management the construction of efficient timetables which ,provide the maximum in way of flexibility for all constituent parts, including stakeholders, is as important as it is challenging. An increasingly important aspect within organisations is an automated approach which optimises all aspects of resource usage. In doing so a number of quantitative and qualitative challenges must be dealt with from both a technical and practical perspective.  
 An important aim of the conference is to align the needs of practitioners and the objectives of researchers. This is achieved through the presentation and application of leading-edge research techniques. Practitioners and Researchers alike are encouraged to present their work and experiences with the overall goal of developing efficient and practical solutions. With this goal in mind, at PATAT  
  2024, researchers and practitioners will be brought together through a number of key presentations and contributed talks.

 PATAT 2022 - Call for papers   
   Submitted by watt  on Tue, 2022-02-01 08:15    
 The 2020 silver anniversary edition of PATAT was originally intended to be held by KU Leuven in Bruges (Belgium), but had to be postponed until 2022 in light of the pandemic. The conference will now instead be held in the equally beautiful city of Leuven (Belgium)  , the university's home town, and will run from Tuesday 30th August until Friday 2nd September 2022  . The venue will be the Irish College, which promises to offer the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect, present and discuss on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-seven years as well as to anticipate where we might be headed throughout the coming decades. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by March 23rd 2022  .  
 Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems (e.g., educational timetabling, timetabling in transport, employee rostering, sports timetabling, timetabling in healthcare), timetabling algorithms (e.g., mathematical programming, heuristic search, metaheuristics - Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Ant Colony Methods, hyper-heuristics, machine learning, matheuristics, constraint-based methods, algorithm portfolios, parallel/distributed computing, multi-objective/multi-criteria approaches), foundational/theoretical studies (e.g. complexity issues), timetabling tools and applications, and any optimization issues related to timetabling.  
 A special track is planned, dedicated to the International Timetabling Competitions on University Course Timetabling (ITC 2019) and Sports Timetabling (ITC 2021)  
 We are pleased to announce that the invited speakers who were confirmed in principle for the 2020 edition have agreed, travel restrictions permitting, to deliver plenary talks at the 2022 edition:

 This is the first IFORS conference to be held in Asia since the 15th conference in China 20 years ago. It is thus an exciting opportunity to bring together operations researchers from the field in Asia, where it has experienced vigorous and rapid growth, with colleagues from all regions of the world.  
 The conference includes a Wednesday-afternoon social event where you can choose among a variety of tours, such as the Demilitarized Zone tour, where you can witness the history of Korea’s division, the Industrial Tour to Korea’s leading ICT companies, as well as other programs that will explore K-POP and Hallyu, K-Beauty and K-Culture, and show you the most historic buildings and markets in the city.  
 The timing of the meeting in late June assures that it will be warm and sunny.  
 2. PATAT 2020 Call for papers   
 In more ways than one, 1995 was a momentous year: a small startup by the name of Amazon sold its first book online, the first ever Wiki was launched, and the Java programming language was announced to the world. But far more importantly (some might say), the year also played host to the very first PATAT conference  in Edinburgh.  
 The 2020 edition of PATAT will therefore mark its silver anniversary. Organized by KU Leuven and to be held in beautiful Bruges (Belgium) August 25-29, 2020  , PATAT 2020 promises to provide the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-five years as well as to anticipate where we might head throughout the next twenty-five. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by January 30, 2020  . Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems, timetabling algorithms, timetabling applications, and any optimization problems elated to timetabling.   
 We are proud to announce that the following professors will deliver plenary talks:  
 Celso C. Ribeiro, Computer Science, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 
  Sigrid Knust, Institut für Informatik, Universität Osnabrück, Germany 
  Andrea Schaerf, Computer Science, University of Udine, Italy 
  Deepak Ajwani, School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland 
  Peter Nightingale, Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK 
  Paper/abstract submission instructions are available at https://easychair.org/cfp/PATAT2020  .  
 Please submit your paper/abstract by January 30, 2020.  
 PATAT 2020 will take place together with the COnfiguration and SElection of ALgorithms (COSEAL) workshop August 23-25, a few days before the conference begins. Further information regarding plenary speakers, paper submissions as well as the scientific and social program are available at the conference website ( http://patatconference.org/patat2020/  ).

 1. EURO Doctoral Dissertation Award 2019   
 The purpose of the prize is to distinguish an outstanding doctoral dissertation in OR defended in the countries having an OR society that is a member of EURO.  
  We invite you to widely disseminate this announcement.  
 THE PRIZE  
 The prize consists of a certificate and reward of €1,000  
 CALL FOR APPLICATIONS  
 The EDDA 2019 jury will only consider dissertations in Operational Research defended between 1 February 2018 and 31 January 2019. The dissertation must have been defended in a University located in a member country of EURO. The author of the dissertation must be a member of a member society of EURO.  
 To be considered, a dissertation should be nominated by the supervisor of the thesis (one of them in case of multiple supervisors). The supervisor of the dissertation is asked to provide the jury with the following information:  
 *The text of the dissertation;  
  *An extended abstract (3 to 5 pages) of the dissertation; this abstract should be written in English and should include precise keywords;  
  *An itemization of the candidate's contribution to each co-authored article if the dissertation contains co-authored articles (i.e., published papers or unpublished manuscripts);  
  *If the dissertation is not in English, a paper in English which has been authored or co-authored by the candidate and which describes the core ideas of the dissertation. This paper should preferably have been published in or submitted to an international journal;  
  *Nomination letters (or reports) from two referees selected by the dissertation supervisor, supporting the submission and stating their assessment of why the dissertation should win the award;  
  *An up-to-date CV of the candidate, including a list of publications.  
 No nomination will be considered without these items. Please also check the guidelines.  
 Since many doctoral dissertations in OR are defended each year only outstanding pieces of work are expected to be submitted. The jury would like to remind supervisors that only high-quality theses might have a chance of winning the award.  
 The jury selects a short-list of finalists who will present their work in a special session at the 30th European Conference on Operational Research in Dublin.

 The PDP conference  

 PDP stands as a premier European and international conference that comprehensively addresses all facets of parallel  and distributed  processing  . Encompassing a spectrum from foundational theory to practical implementation, it spans systems of all scales—from small configurations to the largest infrastructures. PDP addresses fundamental computational challenges alongside robust applications and delves into architecture, compiler, language, interface design and deployment, tools, support infrastructures, and performance optimization.  
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing fields have evolved significantly, marked by the emergence of novel architectures and groundbreaking applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major application area, leveraging parallel and distributed technologies to enhance computational efficiency and enable sophisticated AI models. This progress emphasizes the dynamic fusion of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly advancing domains. In evaluating these cutting-edge developments, it is imperative to highlight the latest research achievements in established areas of parallel and distributed computing, drawing insights from  
  both industrial and academic perspectives.  
 The 2025 PDP Conference will offer a high-quality program featuring research papers, special sessions, and stimulating keynote speakers.

 CFP–Special Issue on International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT 2024)   
   
 Parallel, distributed, and federated machine learning have emerged as prevalent paradigms in contemporary AI technology. The fusion of rapidly evolving machine learning techniques with the extensive literature on parallel and distributed computing has inspired many vivid research topics, including algorithm complexity, architecture, and privacy. Given that machine learning algorithms frequently demand significant computational resources, it becomes imperative to employ proficient parallel and distributed machine learning algorithms to expedite the execution time. Large amount of data communicates through the network during the parallel execution of machine learning algorithms. Consequently, there exists a pressing need for an efficient distributed parallel architecture to reduce the communication time, and also urgent demand for the mechanism to ensure the data privacy.  
  
 Fundamental challenges persist in these topics and many other related ones in algorithms, complexity, and applicational technologies in parallel and distributed machine learning.

  Call for Papers 
  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.  
 Scope   
 In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  
 Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimization. 
  Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. 
  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to:  
 Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. 
  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. 
  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais ( guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk  ) and Annie Liu ( liu@cs.stonybrook.edu  ).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:  
 Regular Research Papers  should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages. 
  Short Papers  may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages. 
  Talk Proposals  may propose lectures about topics of interest for PEPM, existing work representing relevant contributions, or promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories. Talk Proposals must not exceed 2 pages. 
  References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices may not necessarily be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
 and submitted electronically via HotCRP: https://pepm25.hotcrp.com   
 Reviewing will be single-blind.  
 Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).  
 Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop (physically or virtually) to present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.

 Abstracts   

 The Ethical Compiler: Addressing the Is-Ought Gap in Compilation    
   William Bowman    
 The is-ought gap is a problem in moral philosophy observing that ethical judgments (“ought”) cannot be grounded purely in truth judgments (“is”): that an ought  cannot be derived from an is  . This gap renders the following argument invalid: “It is  true that type safe languages prevent bugs and that bugs cause harm, therefore you ought  to write in type safe languages.”. To validate ethical claims, we must bridge the gap between is and ought with some ethical axiom, such as “I believe one ought  not cause harm.”.  
 But what do ethics have to do with manipulating programs? A lot! Ethics are central to correctness! For example, suppose an algorithm infers the type of e  is Bool  , and e  is in fact a Bool  ; the program type checks. Is the program correct—does it behave as it ought  ? We cannot answer this without some ethical axioms: what does the programmer believe ought  to be?  
 I believe one ought to design and implement languages ethically. We must give the programmer the ability to express their ethics—their values and beliefs about a program—in addition to its mere computational content, and build tools that respect the distinction between is and ought. This talk is a guide to ethical language design and implementation possibilities.  
 Bio    
 William J. Bowman is an Assistant Professor of computer science in the Software Practices Lab at University of British Columbia. Broadly speaking, he is interested in making it easier for programmers to communicate their intent to machines, and preserving that intent through compilation. More specifically, their research interests include secure and verified compilation, dependently typed programming, verification, meta-programming, and interoperability. His recent work examines type-preserving compilation of dependently typed programming languages like Coq, a technique that can enable preserving security and correctness invariants of verified software through compilation and statically enforcing those invariants in the low-level (assembly-like) code generated by compilers.  

 Cocon: A Type-Theoretic Framework for Meta-Programming    
   Brigitte Pientka    
 Meta-programming is the art of writing programs that produce or manipulate other programs. This allows programmers to automate error-prone or repetitive tasks, and exploit domain- specific knowledge to customize the generated code. Hence, meta-programming is widely used in a range of technologies: from cryptographic message authentication in secure network protocols to support reflection in proof environments such as Lean.  
 Unfortunately, writing safe meta-programs remains very challenging and sometimes frustrating, as traditionally errors in the generated code are only detected when running it, but not at the time when code is generated. To make it easier to write and maintain meta-programs, tools that allow us to detect errors during code generation - instead of when running the generated code - are essential.  
 This talk revisits Cocon, a framework for certified meta-programming. Cocon is a Martin-Löf dependent type theory for defining logics and proofs that allows us to represent domain-specific languages (DSL) within the logical framework LF and in addition write recursive programs and proofs about those DSLs using pattern matching. It is a two-level type theory where Martin-Löf type theory sits on top of the logical framework LF and supports a recursor over (contextual) LF objects. As a consequence, we can embed into LF STLC or System F, etc. and then write programs about those encodings using Cocon itself.  
 This means Cocon can serve as a target for compiling meta-programming systems -from compiling meta-programming with STLC to System F. Moreover, Cocon supports writing an evaluator for each of these sub-languages. This also allows us to reflect back our encoded sub-language and evaluate their encodings using Cocon’s evaluation strategy.  
 I will conclude with highlighting more recent research directions and challenges that build on the core ideas of Cocon and aim to support meta-programming and intensional code analysis directly in System F and Martin-Löf type theory.  
 Bio    
 Brigitte Pientka a Full Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University. Her main research interests lie in developing theoretical foundations of programming languages. A central question of her work is: How can we design programming languages that ensure that programs are safe and have fewer bugs? In 2018, her work on the Beluga programming language has received the Test of Time Award from International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP).  
 Brigitte Pientka is a leader within the programming languages research community, and serves for example on the SIGPLAN executive committee. In particular, she is passionate about working towards overcoming systemic barriers for underrepresented groups. In 2018, she co-founded the Women in Logic workshop which provides valuable networking opportunity to female researchers and as the general chair for POPL in 2020 she introduced Mentoring Breakfasts which now are a fixture at SIGPLAN events.  

 The Missing Diagonal: High Level Languages for Low Level Systems    
   Satnam Singh    
 The computing community has produced many high level languages and tools for programming high level systems (e.g. Java for user interfaces) and it has produced many low level languages and tools for programming low level systems (C for operating systems, Verilog for hardware design) yet there are not many examples of high level systems that have been produced to help develop low level systems. Sometimes this is due to a suspicion that the layers of abstraction that high level systems use incur unacceptable performance overheads. However, this talk attempts to challenge that view, giving examples of high level systems that improve the designer productivity for developing low level systems which also improve the quality of verification for low level systems.  
 The talk will draw examples from the presenter’s own experience, as well as the work of others. Specific examples will include Lava and Bluespec for the design of hardware, the Silver Oak project for the co-design of a high assurance silicon root of trust, a Haskell-based DSL for programming machine learning chips, and recent work on the specification and verification of parts of a new silicon chip produced at Groq which makes use of the same Haskell DSL.  
 Bio    
 Satnam Singh is a Fellow at Groq where he applies the power of functional programming languages to the design of machine learning chips and their programming models. Satnam Singh previously worked at Google (machine learning chips, cluster management), Facebook (Android optimization), Microsoft (parallel and concurrent programming) and Xilinx (Lava DSL for hardware design). He started his career as an academic at the University of Glasgow (FPGA-based application acceleration and functional programming).

 POPL 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one used for POPL 2023 and 2024 but different from the lightweight double-blind process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.  
 Submissions:  Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  Supplementary material:  Authors are permitted to provide supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. 
  Author response:  In responding to reviews, authors should not say anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process. 
  Dissemination of work under submission:  Authors are welcome to disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the community. 
  The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.  
 However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair  to discuss the situation and how to handle it.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  addresses many common scenarios and answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Evaluation Process   
 Like last year, POPL 2025 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized supplementary material; only anonymized supplementary material may be submitted.  
 POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2025, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl25.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 11, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper submissions:  
 Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart  LaTeX class with acmsmall  option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  , and further information about PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines page  . PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word. 
  We strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options in order to make submissions easier to review. 
  ( NEW this year  ) Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be either author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric. 
  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. 
  Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. 
  Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their submissions, but it must be fully anonymized. 
  Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form. 
  Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information. 
  If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence. 
  Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a higher standard. 
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged (but not required) to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Why are you using full  double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight  double-blind reviewing?   
 A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review (double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity, and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: We discourage the use of external links, but sometimes the most convenient way to share suplementary material such as code or datasets is to include a link to a github repository or a google drive, but it is very important that they are fully anonymized. In particular, a link to your working code repository that exposes the identities of the contributors will be in violation of the double blind policy.  
 The same holds for online demos; reviewers should be able to visit the online demo and potentially browse its source code without being exposed to the identity of the authors (watch out for copyright statements, for example).  
 You should keep in mind that reviewers are under no obligation to review any supplementary material, including externally linked data or code, and reviewers may chose not to visit any externally linked material.  
 Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to a public repository or an online demo would constitute a breach of academic integrity.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper, then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication (e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development of previous papers but which was never properly described in those papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under the same title or a different title – has been presented at an informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous conference or workshop. 
  Post your submission on your home page, your institutional repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever title you want). 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC members with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or job interviews during the POPL review period. 
  The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program Chair.  
 Things you should not  do:  
 Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your work. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks. Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.  
 That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: You are under no obligation to follow any URLs to external supplementary material. If the submission is not self contained and does not convince you by itself about its merits, then the paper should not be accepted. If you ever have reason to suspect that your anonymity was compromised through your following of a link, please share that information with the PC chair immediately, as this would constitute a breach of academic integrity on the part of the authors.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023  , with a few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.

  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation  (PEPM), which has a history going back to 1991 and has co-located with POPL every year since 2006, originates in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over the years, the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centred around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation  — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Scope   
 In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2019 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  
 Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. 
  Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. 
  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2019 include, but are not limited to:  
 Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. 
  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. 
  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Manuel Hermenegildo ( http://cliplab.org/herme/  ) and Atsushi Igarashi ( http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/  ).  
 Submission categories and guidelines   
 Two kinds of submissions will be accepted: Regular Research Papers and Short Papers.  
 Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
 and submitted electronically via HotCRP:  
 https://pepm19.hotcrp.com/   
 PEPM 2019 will employ lightweight double-blind reviewing according to the rules of POPL 2019. Quoting from POPL 2019’s call for papers:  
 “submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and | references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.”  
 See POPL 2019’s Submission and Reviewing FAQ page for more information:  
 https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ   
 Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs) provided that there are non-PC co-authors.  
 Accepted papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of short papers, however, can ask for their papers to be left out of the formal proceedings.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop and present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected. Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing guidelines for both research tool demonstration papers will be made available on the PEPM 2019 web site.  
 Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its web page.  
 Important dates

 igarashi at kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp, manuel.hermenegildo at imdea.org  
  
 Please also include in the email:  
 a short summary of the abstract (in plain text), 
  the type(s) of proposed presentation (poster and/or demo), and 
  whether you would like to give a scheduled short talk (in addition to the poster/demo presentation). 
  Abstracts should be sent no later than:  
 Friday, 14th December 2018, anywhere on earth   
  
 and will be considered for acceptance on a rolling basis. Accepted abstracts, along with their short summary, will be posted on this website.  
 At least one author of each accepted abstract must attend the workshop and present the work during the poster/demo session.  
 Student participants with accepted posters/demos can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe.

  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation  (PEPM), which has a history going back to 1991 and has co-located with POPL every year since 2006, originates in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over the years, the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centred around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation  — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Manuel Hermenegildo ( http://cliplab.org/herme/  ) and Atsushi Igarashi ( http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/  ).  
 Submission categories and guidelines   
 Two kinds of submissions will be accepted: Regular Research Papers and Short Papers.  
 Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
 and submitted electronically via HotCRP:  
 https://pepm19.hotcrp.com/   
 PEPM 2019 will employ lightweight double-blind reviewing according to the rules of POPL 2019. Quoting from POPL 2019’s call for papers:  
 “submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and | references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.”  
 See POPL 2019’s Submission and Reviewing FAQ page for more information:  
 https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ   
 Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs) provided that there are non-PC co-authors.  
 Accepted papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of short papers, however, can ask for their papers to be left out of the formal proceedings.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop and present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected. Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing guidelines for both research tool demonstration papers will be made available on the PEPM 2019 web site.  
 Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its web page.

 The 23rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2025)   
 March 17 – 21, 2025, Washington DC, USA   ( Walter E. Washington Convention Center  )  
   
  Conference Overview   
 IEEE PerCom, now in its 23rd year, will be held at Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington DC, USA  , from March 17 – 21, 2025, as a physical in-person conference. PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile systems research and has found its way into many commercial systems due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.  
 IEEE Percom 2025 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will fully accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel issues or COVID/health-related travel issues.

 Read Before Submitting   
 Note: accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings, the conference program and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.   
 We also strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their US visa as soon as their paper is accepted.   
 Important Dates  (Revised)  
 Paper registration in EasyChair (EXTENDED, FINAL and FIRM)  : Sunday Sep 29, 2024 11.59pm AOE  ( Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE   )  
 Paper submission in EasyChair (EXTENDED, FINAL and FIRM)  : Friday, October 4, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE  ( Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE   )  
 Notification: Friday, Dec 20 2024   
 Camera Ready: early-Feb 2025   
 Best Paper Award and Editorial Follow-Ups   
 The best paper will receive the prestigious Mark Weiser Best Paper Award.  
 Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the  Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal   .  
 Submission Details   
 Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EasyChair   . If you do not have an EasyChair account, please, register first and create an account (it’s free) via the following link: register  . The direct submission link for PerCom 2025 is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=percom2025  ; paper submission will be active from September 5. Select “ Research Track  ” from the list of tracks to submit papers to the main conference.  
 PerCom 2025 will follow a double-blind review process  . As a result, authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers. However, papers that are judged not to have created a suitable double-blind version may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and may not be under consideration elsewhere for publication at any point in the review process  . Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF  format will be considered.  
 The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found here  . Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content  ( 10pt font, 2-column format  ), including text, figures, tables and appendices, and up to 1 additional page for references  only. Papers that violate the formatting instructions may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.

 Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the  Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal   .  
 Submission Details   
 Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EasyChair   . If you do not have an EasyChair account, please, register first and create an account (it’s free) via the following link: register  . The direct submission link for PerCom 2025 is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=percom2025  ; paper submission will be active from September 5. Select “ Research Track  ” from the list of tracks to submit papers to the main conference.  
 PerCom 2025 will follow a double-blind review process  . As a result, authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers. However, papers that are judged not to have created a suitable double-blind version may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and may not be under consideration elsewhere for publication at any point in the review process  . Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF  format will be considered.  
 The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found here  . Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content  ( 10pt font, 2-column format  ), including text, figures, tables and appendices, and up to 1 additional page for references  only. Papers that violate the formatting instructions may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.

Papers reporting strong systems engineering contributions backed by solid and appropriate evaluations are strongly encouraged. The impact of the contributions should be demonstrated in the context of pervasive computing and communications applications.   
 Read Before Submitting   
 Note: accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings, the conference program and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.   
 We also strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their US visa as soon as their paper is accepted.   
 Important Dates  (Revised)  
 Paper registration in EasyChair (EXTENDED, FINAL and FIRM)  : Sunday Sep 29, 2024 11.59pm AOE  ( Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE   )  
 Paper submission in EasyChair (EXTENDED, FINAL and FIRM)  : Friday, October 4, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE  ( Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE   )  
 Notification: Friday, Dec 20 2024   
 Camera Ready: early-Feb 2025   
 Best Paper Award and Editorial Follow-Ups   
 The best paper will receive the prestigious Mark Weiser Best Paper Award.  
 Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the  Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal   .  
 Submission Details   
 Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EasyChair   . If you do not have an EasyChair account, please, register first and create an account (it’s free) via the following link: register  . The direct submission link for PerCom 2025 is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=percom2025  ; paper submission will be active from September 5. Select “ Research Track  ” from the list of tracks to submit papers to the main conference.  
 PerCom 2025 will follow a double-blind review process  . As a result, authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers. However, papers that are judged not to have created a suitable double-blind version may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and may not be under consideration elsewhere for publication at any point in the review process  . Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF  format will be considered.  
 The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found here  . Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content  ( 10pt font, 2-column format  ), including text, figures, tables and appendices, and up to 1 additional page for references  only. Papers that violate the formatting instructions may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.

  Call For Papers   
   
 About The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties. Scope In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular: Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to: Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu). AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-09-15
