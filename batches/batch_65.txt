 The 11th International Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering: Theories, Tools and Applications (SETTA 2025), will be held in Oxford on December 2025. The event will be hosted at St. Catherine's College.   
 Formal methods emerged as an important area in computer science and software engineering about half a century ago. An international community has formed researching, developing and teaching formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification. However, the impact of formal methods on the quality and improvement of software systems is, in practice, lagging behind. This is for instance reflected by the challenges in applying formal techniques and tools to engineering large-scale systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, and so forth.   
 The purpose of the SETTA symposium is to bring international researchers together to exchange research results and ideas on bridging the gap between formal methods and software engineering. It aims at academic excellence and its objective is to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering in Asia. All previous instances of SETTA have taken place in Asia and 2025 is the first time the conference is being held outside its traditional home region.   
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of the formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers into the community. Thus, this symposium particularly encourages the participation of young researchers and students.   
 Authors are invited to submit papers on original research, industrial applications, or position papers proposing challenges in fundamental research and technology. The latter two types of submissions are expected to contribute to the development of formal methods and applications thereof in software engineering. This is done by either substantiating the advantages of integrating formal methods into the development cycle or through delineating the need for research by demonstrating weaknesses of existing technologies, especially when addressing new application domains.   
 All submissions must be in the PDF format. Papers should be written in English. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. The review process is  double-blind  and each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the technical program committee. All accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of their authors. Extended version of selected papers will be recommended to special issues of a reputable journal (TBA) after the proceedings of the conference.   

 Topics and Scope    

  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   
 Requirements specification and analysis 
  Formalisms for modeling, design and implementation 
  Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures 
  Scalable approaches to formal system analysis 
  Formal approaches to simulation, run-time verification, and testing 
  Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice 
  Contract-based engineering of components, systems, and systems of systems 
  Formal and engineering aspects of software evolution and maintenance 
  Parallel and multicore programming 
  Embedded, real-time, hybrid, probabilistic, and cyber-physical systems 
  Mixed-critical applications and systems 
  Formal aspects of service-oriented and cloud computing 
  Safety, reliability, robustness, and fault-tolerance

 ABOUT SETTA   
 Formal methods emerged as a distinct area in computer science and software engineering half a century ago. An international community has formed to research, develop and teach formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification.  
 The practical impact of these theories, techniques and tools on improving everyday software systems is, however, debatable. There is a persistent gap between the development of formal methods and advances in software technologies. Indeed, the relation between them is not clearly understood.  
 Nowhere is this more evident than in the difficulty of applying formal techniques and tools to engineer large-scale systems with multi-dimensional complexities. Examples include Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Networks of Things, Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, etc.  
 These challenges motivate the Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering Theories, Tools and Applications. The symposium exists to promote research, sharing, the exchange of ideas and discussions on:  
 Theories, techniques, tools and their applications, and especially on understanding their impact, weaknesses and the practical software design problems they can solve effectively; 
  The relations between, and common foundations of, different theoretical frameworks and techniques so as to scale up their application to complex system design and verification; 
  “Big and bold” ideas about how to increase the relevance of formal methods research, development, and education to engineering practitioners; 
  Research and experiments on domain-specific applications of formal techniques and tools. 
   
 The symposium program will comprise:  
 regular presentations on research findings related to the above themes; 
  progress reports on ongoing research or projects; 
  position papers that propose challenges in fundamental research and technology development; 
  industrial applications and experiences of formal methods; 
  research presentations by PhD students. 
   
 The purpose of the symposium is to bring international researchers to exchange research results and ideas with the Chinese computer science and software engineering community. We hope to develop understanding of the research of different groups so as to encourage closer and interest-driven research collaborations. The symposium aims at academic excellence with the objective of becoming a flagship conference on formal software engineering in China.  
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers to the community. The participation of young researchers and students is thus especially welcomed.

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES   
 The 10th International Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering: Theories, Tools and Applications (SETTA 2024), will be held in Hong Kong, China in Nov. 26-28, 2024.  
 Formal methods emerged as an important area in computer science and software engineering about half a century ago. An international community has formed researching, developing and teaching formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification. However, the impact of formal methods on the quality and improvement of software systems is, in practice, lagging behind. This is for instance reflected by the challenges in applying formal techniques and tools to engineering large-scale systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, and so forth.  
 The purpose of the SETTA symposium is to bring international researchers together to exchange research results and ideas on bridging the gap between formal methods and software engineering. SETTA will show research interests and results from different groups so as to initiate interest-driven research collaboration. It is aiming at academic excellence and its objective is to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering in China.  
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of the formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers into the community. Thus, this symposium particularly encourages the participation of young researchers and students.  
 Authors are invited to submit papers on original research, industrial applications, or position papers proposing challenges in fundamental research and technology. The latter two types of submissions are expected to contribute to the development of formal methods and applications thereof in software engineering. This is done by either substantiating the advantages of integrating formal methods into the development cycle or through delineating the need for research by demonstrating weaknesses of existing technologies, especially when addressing new application domains.  
 All submissions must be in the PDF format. Papers should be written in English. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. The review process is single-blind. All accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of their authors. Extended version of selected papers will be recommended to special issues of a reputable journal (TBA) after the proceeding of the conference.

 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned.  
 Industry Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting.  
 Idea Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results.  
 Tool Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough.  
 Replication Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances.  
 Journal-first Submission  (max 1 page)  
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site.  
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:  
 Research Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation 
  Experience Reports  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Actionability, Lessons, Presentation 
  Industry Papers  will be evaluated like Research Papers  when presenting research results and like Experience Reports  when reporting on experiences 
  Idea Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Tool Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Presentation 
  Replication Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Journal-first Submissions  will be evaluated based on their own category, as described above. 
  The evaluation criteria are defined as follows:  
 Relevance | : The extent to which the paper is relevant to CSEE&T. 
  Significance | : The extent to which the paper is well-motivated and its contributions are original and important, with respect to the existing literature on software engineering education and training. 
  Soundness | : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods and whether the paper discusses meaningfully the research methods’ limitations and threats to the validity of the findings. 
  Verifiability | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. This includes public availability of research data. In cases where this is not possible, an explicit statement covering why such data cannot be made publicly available is mandatory. 
  Actionability | : The extent to which the paper provides actionable advice with clear take-away messages. 
  Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
  Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
  How to Submit   
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
  All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
  By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the IEEE | , | submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site   by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review  .  
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.  
 Open Science Policy   
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable.  
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified.  
 IMPORTANT  : We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability  after the Conclusion  section. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via the HotCRP submission site  . Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.  
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 Synthesis from LTL with Reward Optimization in Sampled Oblivious Environments  
  Abstract   
 This paper addresses the synthesis of reactive systems that enforce hard constraints while optimizing for quality-based soft constraints. We build on recent advancements in combining reactive synthesis with example-based guidance to handle both types of constraints in stochastic, oblivious environments accessible only through sampling. Our approach constructs examples that satisfy LTL-based hard constraints while maximizing expected rewards—representing the soft constraints—on samples drawn from the environment. We formally define this synthesis problem, prove it to be NP-complete  , and propose an SMT-based solution, demonstrating its effectiveness with a case study.

 An Assertion-Based Logic for Local Reasoning about Probabilistic Programs  
  Abstract   
 We introduce an assertion-based logic specifically designed for local reasoning about probabilistic programs featuring unbounded loops. Distribution formulas and their extensions facilitate the representation of invariants for unbounded loops in probabilistic programs. The assertions connected by separating conjunction exhibit probabilistic independence, which more intuitively displays the mutually independent properties of variables and ensures that the logic supports local reasoning. We prove the soundness of our logic and showcase its effectiveness through the formal verification of a wide range of examples including probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks and security analysis of cryptographic schemes.

 Extending Symbolic Heap to Support Shared Ownership  
  Abstract   
 The symbolic heap is widely used in verification of pointer-manipulating programs because it supports forward symbolic execution. While it can describe disjoint data structures easily, it is not suitable to describe overlapping data structures. Based on the observations that overlapping structures are often immutable in practical programs, we propose read-only assertions and extended separation logic to solve the problem. Our logic simplifies the specifications and verifications of overlapping structures. We formalize our logic, its soundness proof, and program verification examples in Coq.

 Constraint Based Invariant Generation with Modular Operations  
  Abstract   
 Invariant generation is a fundamental problem in program verification that targets the automated generation of invariants that capture the set of reachable program states. Modular operations that calculate the remainder of an integer variable against a divisor are common in programs, and therefore the generation of invariants with modular information is indispensible for proving the correctness of such programs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating affine invariants with modular information via constraint solving. Our approach first transforms affine programs with modular operations into affine transition systems, and then applies existing approaches in Farkas’ Lemma to solve the invariants. Experimental results over a suite of benchmarks that involve complex modular operations show that our approach is time efficient and can generate tight or even accurate linear invariants with modular information.

 Data-Dependent WAR Analysis for Efficient Task-Based Intermittent Computing  
  Abstract   
 Energy harvesting systems provide power solutions for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, liberating them from battery life constraints. However, unstable power supplies can cause frequent power failures. This leads to the non-progress problem, where the system loses its state and, upon power restoration, is unable to resume unfinished programs, forcing it to start from the beginning. To tackle this issue, task-based Intermittent Computing (ImC) has been proposed. This approach breaks the program into multiple tasks and uses non-volatile memory (NVM) to store the results of completed tasks. When power is restored, the system can resume from the last unfinished task, avoiding the need to restart the entire program. However, a specific type of data, known as write-after-read (WAR) data, can introduce consistency errors during execution. Current approaches prevent these errors by backing up WAR data before task execution, but identifying such data precisely remains a challenge. Runtime detection methods can accurately find WAR data but introduce significant performance overhead. Meanwhile, static analysis techniques tend to be overly conservative, resulting in excessive and unnecessary backups. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing methods, then propose a hybrid WAR analysis method. This approach combines static analysis and leverages information during run-time to more accurately identify WAR data, with nearly no increase in run-time overhead. Experimental results indicate that compared to existing methods, our approach can significantly reduce system backup overhead and achieve up to a \(9.20\times \)  performance improvement.

 Can Language Models Pretend Solvers? Logic Code Simulation with LLMs  
  Abstract   
 Logical solvers are typically employed for the static analysis and formal verification of functional code that is not amenable to verification through execution. Concurrently, some research efforts aim to convert natural language into logic code to bolster reasoning capabilities with the aid of logical solvers. However, the transformation process from code or natural language to a logical framework is costly. To address this challenge, several studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to facilitate this transformation. Nevertheless, LLMs may introduce misalignment and formatting errors that are unacceptable for logical solvers. Considering the strong logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their relative insensitivity to alignment and formatting errors, we propose utilizing LLMs to emulate logical solvers for logic code simulation. In light of the characteristic fixed outputs of logical solvers, we introduce a novel LLM-based code simulation technique called Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL). Additionally, we have compiled three new datasets specifically for the Logic Code Simulation task and conducted comprehensive evaluations. These assessments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when compared to other LLM prompt strategies, achieving a notable 7.06% improvement in accuracy with GPT-4 Turbo.

 Enhancing Multi-modal Regular Expression Synthesis via Large Language Models and Semantic Manipulations of Sub-expressions  
  Abstract   
 Real-world regular expressions (regexes) are widely used in practice. Since regexes are difficult to comprehend and write, automatically synthesizing regexes has been an important research problem. However, current techniques face challenges like weak capability in generalization and severely limited support of extended features of regexes. In this paper, we address these challenges via Large Language Models (LLMs) together with semantic manipulations of sub-expressions, and propose PowerSyn, a framework for regex synthesis based on both natural language descriptions and examples and supports extended features. Specifically, we design the prompt suitable for synthesizing regexes with LLMs and present novel algorithms to manipulate sub-expressions, which consider the matching relation, and are guided by examples. The evaluation results demonstrate the significant efficacy of our approach.

 Formal Verification of RISC-V Processor Chisel Designs  
  Abstract   
 Chisel is an open-source high-level hardware construction language embedded in Scala to facilitate parameterizable, reusable circuit design generators. It is becoming increasingly popular and has been used to design many RISC-V processor variants. Formal verification has been adapted to check the (functional) correctness of RISC-V processor designs. However, the RISC-V instructions therein are specified in the low-level hardware languages Verilog/SystemVerilog, which are challenging to develop, maintain, and extend. This considerably lowers the advantage of RISC-V for designing highly customizable processors. In this work, we present the first end-to-end approach for formally verifying the correctness of RISC-V processor designs, fully at the Chisel high-level. Specifically, by utilizing the object-oriented and functional programming constructs offered by Chisel, we develop a high-level reference model of RISC-V instructions in Chisel. This reference model is a succinct, modular, and parameterized RISC-V processor design generator, thus can produce customized RISC-V processor variants. We then devise a novel queue-based synchronization mechanism between the RISC-V processor Chisel design and the reference model by which the correctness verification of the RISC-V processor design is reduced to the model-checking problem and off-the-shelf model-checkers can be harnessed. We implement our approach in an open-source tool and demonstrate its efficacy on two representative open-source RISC-V processor designs in Chisel (i.e., riscv-mini and NutShell). The experiment results confirm the efficacy of our approach, capable of discovering 7 real-world unknown non-conformance bugs and all the 10 manually injected bugs. It is also three-orders-of-magnitude more efficient than the state-of-the-art symbolic-execution based approach.

 The Principle of Staking: Formal Verification of Staking Smart Contract  
  Abstract   
 Recently, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms have been widely adopted by various blockchain platforms due to their superior performance and lower environmental impact. As a relatively new and somewhat unfamiliar consensus mechanism, PoS presents potential security risks. Staking is an extremely important concept in PoS, serving as the entry point to the PoS mechanism. It allows users to lock in their assets to obtain the right to participate in network consensus. As of today, research on it remains limited. Therefore, this paper aims to ensure the security of users’ staked assets and the stability of the consensus network by analyzing the staking mechanism in PoS and modeling a general staking model. We enhance the security attributes of the model by adding a set of high-level properties. Finally, we verify its rationality and effectiveness in the Move language environment.

 A Contract-Based Framework for Formal Verification of Embedded Software  
  Abstract   
 Contract-based design is a useful software engineering paradigm and has been exploited in many literatures for taming the complexity of embedded system development. A system is divided hierarchically into components in a top-down manner, where each component is associated with contracts structured in pairs of assumptions and guarantees. The strength of contract-based design enables stepwise refinement, compositional verification, and reuse of components etc. In this paper, we present a verification framework that builds upon contract-based design to ensure the correctness of embedded software. This framework can be integrated with many formal techniques, e.g., compositional verification, model checking, static analysis, runtime verification, that are shaped in a formal verification chain from the design perspective to the implementation perspective. First, a design level hierarchical model made up of components is abstracted for embedded software, and contracts relevant to components are specified and verified in temporal logic. Second, the behaviour models are constructed for the components located at the bottom of the hierarchical model, and verified using the same contracts at the first step. Third, the implementation of the bottom components are verified, still using the same contracts. Consequently, the consistency between design and implementation of embedded software is strictly proved. We provide a practical case study in the field of aerospace to illustrate the feasibility of our approach, where temporal logic LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) is employed for reasoning as contracts throughout the verification chain.

 Formalizing x86-64 ISA in Isabelle/HOL: A Binary Semantics for eBPF JIT Correctness  
  Abstract   
 Binary semantics forms a critical infrastructure for proving the correctness of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, an advanced technique to optimize runtime execution by translating the source bytecode of a program into target machine code. This paper presents a formal model of x86-64 binary semantics in Isabelle/HOL, as the foundation to verify the eBPF x86-64 JIT correctness for the Solana blockchain. First, we formalize a significant subset of x86-64 semantics, covering all the x86-64 instructions used in the Solana JIT. Second, we develop an encoder and decoder to establish a precise bidirectional mapping between assembly and binary code. Furthermore, we demonstrate the equivalence property of the x86-64 encoder-decoder pair, significantly simplifying the correctness proof of the Solana JIT compiler verification.

 The Design of Intelligent Temperature Control System of Smart House with MARS  
  Abstract   
 MARS is a toolchain, supporting model-based design of cyber-physical systems (CPS), which integrates informal and formal design. With MARS, a system under development can be graphically modeled by the combination of AADL and Simulink/Stateflow, then the simulation of the graphical model can be conducted. Furthermore, the graphical model can be automatically transformed to Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes (HCSP) for formal verification with HHLProver. Finally, ANSI-C code or SystemC code can be generated from the verified HCSP formal model with the guarantee of correctness. As a case study of CPS, in this paper, we apply MARS to design an intelligent temperature control system, including its modeling, simulation, verification and code generation. This case study demonstrates the advantages of the design of CPS with MARS, including the integration of modeling, simulation, verification and code generation; the integration of informal and formal design, thus providing balance between efficiency and rigidity.

 Universal Construction for Linearizable but Not Strongly Linearizable Concurrent Objects  
  Abstract   
 Strong linearizability is a variant of linearizability and is more suitable for verification. In this paper we investigate the following two problems: (1) for which deterministic sequential specifications there exist linearizable but not strongly linearizable objects; (2) can we capture any violation scheme of strong linearizability for practical objects that are linearizable but not strongly linearizable.   
 To deal with the first problem, we propose two classes of deterministic sequential specifications called inclusively-permutative sequential specifications and exclusively-permutative sequential specifications. The first class of sequential specifications contains sequential specifications of counter, register, max-register, snapshot, set, queue, stack and priority queue. The second class of sequential specifications contains sequential specifications of blocking queue, blocking stack and blocking priority queue. To establish these results, we propose a uniform methodology to construct a wait-free, linearizable but not strongly linearizable object for these two classes of sequential specifications. Our universal construction is based on the classical universal construction, and it additionally permits each operation to change the “take-effect-order” of previous operations.   
 To deal with the second problem, we use bi-branch distinguishable executions to represent violations of strong linearizability. We investigate eight objects that are linearizable but not strongly linearizable, and we show that for each object, it has a pair of bi-branch distinguishable executions such that our universal construction can generate another pair of bi-branch distinguishable executions with the same set of histories.

 Cache Behavior Analysis with SP-Relative Addressing for WCET Estimation  
  Abstract   
 Accurately bounding the worst-case execution time (WCET) is crucial for efficient real-time system design. Precisely analyzing whether a memory reference results in a cache miss or a cache hit significantly impacts the accuracy of the estimated WCET bound, as the latency of a cache miss is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of a cache hit access. SP-relative addressing enables dynamic memory allocation on the stack, enhances thread safety, an therefore is widely adopted in embedded real-time systems. However, existing cache behavior analysis requires obtaining the exact address of each memory reference and pessimistically assumes that SP-relative addressing could access any memory address, resulting in an overestimated WCET bound. In this paper, we propose a new WCET analysis framework that first identifies the program segments in which the SP value remains constant for a accurate cache behavior analysis, and then comprehensively compute the WCET of the whole program based on the constraints between the SP value defined by the program’s control flow. Experimental results show that, our method can tighten the estimated WCET bound by up to 36.31% and achieve an average improvement of 11.85%.

 Timing Analysis of Cause-Effect Chains for External Events with Finite Validity Intervals  
  Abstract   
 In complex real-time systems, specific functionality is generally implemented by a cause-effect chain, which is a sequence of multi-rate real-time tasks with data dependency. One of the critical prerequisites for the correct operation of such systems is that the external event is timely captured by the first task of the corresponding chain, propagated to the last task and generates a response during a predefined time interval. Most of existing work assumes the external event keeps continuously valid and focuses on when the response will be generated. However, in actual scenarios, the external event may become invalid shortly after its occurrence and there will never be a response to it. This paper considers such external events with finite validity intervals and proposes techniques to analyze the minimum validity interval of an external event to guarantee the existence of a corresponding response. Experiments with both a randomly generated workload and a case study are conducted to evaluate and verify the proposed techniques.

 Runtime Verification of Neural-Symbolic Systems  
  Abstract   
 Neural-symbolic systems (NSSs), which are typically cyber-physical systems integrated with artificial intelligence modules, have received much attention in both academic and industrial fields. However, thorough verification (such as model checking) of such systems in general leads to prohibitively high costs due to the scale of the state space, and this makes it barely accomplishable within desired time-span. Consequently, light-weight verification techniques are introduced to deal with such cases, e.g., runtime verification (RV, for short).   
 In this paper, we investigate an RV framework for NSSs against signal temporal logic (STL) properties. To guarantee that the on-line monitoring could be accomplished in time, we utilize Euler-prediction to sample the system under scrutiny at discrete time-steps. Our framework supports both qualitative and quantitative on-line monitoring of STL specifications, and thus it terminates whenever a property is satisfied and/or violated by a finite prefix of the trajectory, and it can also provide the bounds of the quantitative satisfaction/violation w.r.t. the remaining execution. Notably, for the so-called piece-wise linear NSSs against affine STL formulas, our approach is exact. On top of it, a prototype tool is implemented, and is experimentally evaluated. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the presented runtime verification approach.

 Eidos: Efficient, Imperceptible Adversarial 3D Point Clouds  
  Abstract   
 Classification of 3D point clouds is a challenging machine learning (ML) task with important real-world applications in a spectrum from autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery to earth observation from low orbit. As with other ML tasks, classification models are notoriously brittle in the presence of adversarial attacks. These are rooted in imperceptible changes to inputs with the effect that a seemingly well-trained model ends up misclassifying the input. This paper adds to the understanding of adversarial attacks by presenting Eidos  , a framework providing E  fficient I  mperceptible a D  versarial attacks on 3D p O  int cloud S  . Eidos  supports a diverse set of imperceptibility metrics. It employs an iterative, two-step procedure to identify optimal adversarial examples, thereby enabling a runtime-imperceptibility trade-off. We provide empirical evidence relative to several popular 3D point cloud classification models and several established 3D attack methods, showing Eidos  ’ superiority with respect to efficiency as well as imperceptibility. Eidos  is an open-source project, and its code is available on GitHub at https://​github.​com/​Uzukidd/​eidos    .

 MILE: A Mutation Testing Framework of In-Context Learning Systems  
  Abstract   
 In-context Learning (ICL) has achieved notable success in large language models (LLMs) applications. By adding only a few input-output pairs demonstrating a new task, LLMs can efficiently learn the task during inference without modifying their parameters. Such mysterious ability of LLMs has attracted great research interests in understanding, formatting, and improving the in-context demonstrations, while still suffering from drawbacks like black-box mechanisms and sensitivity against the selection of examples. In this work, inspired by the foundations of adopting testing techniques in machine learning (ML) systems, we propose a mutation testing framework designed to characterize the quality and effectiveness of test data for ICL systems. First, we propose several mutation operators specialized for ICL demonstrations, as well as the corresponding mutation scores for ICL test sets. With comprehensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of our framework in evaluating the reliability and quality of ICL test suites. Our code is available at https://​github.​com/​weizeming/​MILE    .

 A Derivative-Based Membership Algorithm for Enhanced Regular Expressions  
  Abstract   
 Enhanced regular expressions (EREs), which extend standard regular expressions with shuffle and counting operators, provide exponentially more succinct descriptions of regular languages. The membership problem, determining whether a given word w  belongs to the language generated by an ERE E  , is fundamental to numerous applications. However, efficient solutions for the membership problem of unconstrained EREs have remained elusive. This paper introduces a derivative for the counting operator and rigorously proves its correctness. We then leverage this derivative to design a membership algorithm for unconstrained EREs and analyze its time complexity based on a lemma establishing the relationship between the size of the derivative and the expression. We further propose algorithms based on the proposed derivatives to generate positive and negative words of specific lengths for EREs. The performance of the membership algorithm is then evaluated on real-world EREs. Finally, we validate the correctness of two existing inference algorithms that previously lacked formal correctness guarantees due to the absence of practical membership algorithms for unconstrained EREs.

 NanoHook: An Efficient System Call Hooking Technique with One-Byte Invasive  
  Abstract   
 System calls serve as the primary interface between the operating system kernel and user-space programs and can be hooked to trace, analyze, and modify program behavior. Minimizing the overhead introduced by system call hooking techniques is crucial to prevent performance degradation of the hooked program. Moreover, modifications to the process instructions by the hooking technique should be minimal to avoid unintended side effects. However, existing techniques struggle to balance these requirements. Techniques such as syscall user dispatch (SUD) and ptrace avoid modifying process instructions but introduce substantial overhead, whereas other low-overhead techniques often require modifying multiple bytes or instructions to redirect the system call to the hook function. This paper introduces NanoHook, an innovative system call hooking technique tailored for 32-bit programs. NanoHook leverages the specific jump behavior of 32-bit programs during system calls. This approach only requires binary rewriting of one byte of a particular instruction to hook system calls with minimal overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that NanoHook reduces the overhead, defined as the additional time required to execute a system call after introducing the hooking technique, by a factor of 6.7 to 13, 335.6 compared to existing techniques. When applied to Redis, NanoHook incurs only a 4% performance loss, significantly lower than the 8.3% to 94.85% performance degradation observed with other techniques.

 Faster Lifetime-Optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination for Goto-Free Programs  
  Abstract   
 Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE) is one of the most classical, ubiquitous and effective techniques used by compilers for redundancy elimination, i.e. avoiding unnecessary recomputations of the same expression. State-of-the-art methods for LOSPRE over structured programs are based on treewidth, i.e. they first compute a tree decomposition of the control-flow graph of the program and then perform dynamic programming on this decomposition. In this work, we consider a different decomposition approach which is called series-parallel-loop (SPL) and was recently introduced in [ 8  ]. We present an efficient linear-time LOSPRE algorithm that builds upon SPL decompositions. We then provide extensive experimental results over the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) benchmarks, demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the highly-optimized treewidth-based approach of SDCC.

 EDSLog: Efficient Log Anomaly Detection Method Based on Dataset Partitioning  
  Abstract   
 With the growing demand for computility, the reliability of computility services has become increasingly crucial. Due to the escalating volume and complexity of tasks processed, computility services often need to operate under high load, which can easily lead to issues such as resource shortages and service interruptions. Logs in computility services meticulously record the operational information of each component; therefore, anomaly detection based on logs can effectively ensure the stable operation of computility services. This study aims to address two challenges in the field of log anomaly detection. First, this study addresses the previously overlooked issue of class-imbalanced log data. Second, given the massive volumes of log data, the time required for model training poses a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose EDSLog, a novel efficient log anomaly detection framework based on dataset partitioning. Initially, EDSLog processes log sequences through the Weight-Based K-fold Sub Hold-out Method (WKHM), effectively alleviating the class-imbalance problem. Subsequently, EDSLog leverages Simple Recurrent Units (SRU) enhanced by a self-attention mechanism to extract features from log sequences. Finally, EDSLog determines whether the predicted log data are anomalous. Experiments show that EDSLog achieves the best evaluation metrics in class-imbalanced datasets while having the shortest total model runtime. Specifically, EDSLog achieved the highest F1 scores of 100 and 99.96 respectively on the BGL and HDFS datasets, where abnormal logs account for 0.1% of the data. Additionally, EDSLog’s training speed was 35.62% faster than the model with the second shortest training duration among all models compared.

  Submission Categories   
 Research Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 A research paper must address a topic related to software engineering education using appropriate research techniques and proper scholarly writing. Negative and mixed findings are welcome.  
 Experience Report  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned.  
 Industry Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting.  
 Idea Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results.  
 Tool Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough.  
 Replication Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances.  
 Journal-first Submission  (max 1 page)  
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site.  
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:  
 Research Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation 
  Experience Reports  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Actionability, Lessons, Presentation 
  Industry Papers  will be evaluated like Research Papers  when presenting research results and like Experience Reports  when reporting on experiences 
  Idea Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Tool Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Presentation 
  Replication Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Journal-first Submissions  will be evaluated based on their own category, as described above. 
  The evaluation criteria are defined as follows:  
 Relevance | : The extent to which the paper is relevant to CSEE&T. 
  Significance | : The extent to which the paper is well-motivated and its contributions are original and important, with respect to the existing literature on software engineering education and training. 
  Soundness | : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods and whether the paper discusses meaningfully the research methods’ limitations and threats to the validity of the findings. 
  Verifiability | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. This includes public availability of research data. In cases where this is not possible, an explicit statement covering why such data cannot be made publicly available is mandatory. 
  Actionability | : The extent to which the paper provides actionable advice with clear take-away messages. 
  Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
  Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
  How to Submit   
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
  All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
  By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the IEEE | , | submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site   by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review  .  
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.  
 Open Science Policy   
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable.  
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified.  
 IMPORTANT  : We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability  after the Conclusion  section. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via the HotCRP submission site  . Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.  
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

 In 2025, the 37th edition of CSEE&T will be co-located with ICSE 2025  - the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering - in Ottawa, Canada. CSEE&T 2025 will replace ICSE’s traditional education track (SEET)  , allowing for a greater focus on software engineering education through a dedicated co-located conference. By joining forces with ICSE, we aim to bring together the two communities best placed to address the many challenges of educating the next generation of software engineers.  
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to solicit, review, and publish original high-quality contributions addressing challenges, innovations, and best practices in software engineering education and training. All types of software engineering education are of interest, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary education, university education at undergraduate and graduate levels, coding clubs, hackathons, bootcamps, industrial training, informal study, and life-long learning.

  Submission Categories   
 Research Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 A research paper must address a topic related to software engineering education using appropriate research techniques and proper scholarly writing. Negative and mixed findings are welcome.  
 Experience Report  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned.  
 Industry Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting.  
 Idea Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results.  
 Tool Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough.  
 Replication Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances.  
 Journal-first Submission  (max 1 page)  
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site.  
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:  
 Research Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation 
  Experience Reports  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Actionability, Lessons, Presentation 
  Industry Papers  will be evaluated like Research Papers  when presenting research results and like Experience Reports  when reporting on experiences 
  Idea Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Tool Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Presentation 
  Replication Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Journal-first Submissions  will be evaluated based on their own category, as described above. 
  The evaluation criteria are defined as follows:  
 Relevance | : The extent to which the paper is relevant to CSEE&T. 
  Significance | : The extent to which the paper is well-motivated and its contributions are original and important, with respect to the existing literature on software engineering education and training. 
  Soundness | : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods and whether the paper discusses meaningfully the research methods’ limitations and threats to the validity of the findings. 
  Verifiability | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. This includes public availability of research data. In cases where this is not possible, an explicit statement covering why such data cannot be made publicly available is mandatory. 
  Actionability | : The extent to which the paper provides actionable advice with clear take-away messages. 
  Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
  Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
  How to Submit   
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
  All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
  By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the IEEE | , | submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site   by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review  .  
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.  
 Open Science Policy   
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable.  
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified.  
 IMPORTANT  : We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability  after the Conclusion  section. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via the HotCRP submission site  . Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.  
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

 CALL FOR PAPERS   
 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES   
 The Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering: Theories, Tools and Applications (SETTA) 2023 will be held in Nanjing on November 27-29, 2023.  
 Formal methods emerged as an important area in computer science and software engineering about half a century ago. An international community has formed researching, developing and teaching formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification. However, the impact of formal methods on the quality and improvement of software systems is, in practice, lagging behind. This is for instance reflected by the challenges in applying formal techniques and tools to engineering large-scale systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, and so forth.  
 The purpose of the SETTA symposium is to bring international researchers together to exchange research results and ideas on bridging the gap between formal methods and software engineering. SETTA will show research interests and results from different groups so as to initiate interest-driven research collaboration. It is aiming at academic excellence and its objective is to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering in China.  
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of the formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers into the community. Thus, this symposium particularly encourages the participation of young researchers and students.  
 Authors are invited to submit papers on original research, industrial applications, or position papers proposing challenges in fundamental research and technology. The latter two types of submissions are expected to contribute to the development of formal methods and applications thereof in software engineering. This is done by either substantiating the advantages of integrating formal methods into the development cycle or through delineating the need for research by demonstrating weaknesses of existing technologies, especially when addressing new application domains.  
 All submissions must be in the PDF format. Papers should be written in English. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.  
   
 TOPICS   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Requirements specification and analysis 
  Formalisms for modeling, design and implementation 
  Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures 
  Scalable approaches to formal system analysis 
  Formal approaches to simulation, run-time verification, and testing 
  Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice 
  Contract-based engineering of components, systems, and systems of systems 
  Formal and engineering aspects of software evolution and maintenance 
  Parallel and multicore programming 
  Embedded, real-time, hybrid, probabilistic, and cyber-physical systems 
  Mixed-critical applications and systems 
  Formal aspects of service-oriented and cloud computing 
  Safety, reliability, robustness, and fault-tolerance 
  Dependability of smart software and systems 
  Empirical analysis techniques and integration with formal methods 
  Applications and industrial experience reports 
  Software tools to assist the construction or analysis of software systems 

 RESEARCH PAPERS TRACK   
 Research papers will be published in the SETTA 2023 proceedings as a volume in Springer's LNCS series.

 Joint 41 th  IEEE Software Engineering Workshop (SEW-41)  
  and  
  8 th  International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (IWCPS-8)  
 online, 2 - 5 September, 2021  
 Committee   
 The IEEE Software Engineering Workshop (SEW) is the oldest Software Engineering event in the world, dating back to 1969. The workshop was originally run as the NASA Software Engineering Workshop and focused on software engineering issues relevant to NASA and the space industry. After the 25 th  edition, it became the NASA/IEEE Software Engineering Workshop and expanded its remit to address many more areas of software engineering with emphasis on practical issues, industrial experience and case studies in addition to traditional technical papers. Since its 31 st  edition, it has been sponsored by IEEE and has continued to broaden its areas of interest.  
 One such extremely hot new area are Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), which encompass the investigation of approaches related to the development and use of modern software systems interfacing with real world and controlling their surroundings. CPS are physical and engineering systems closely integrated with their typically networked environment. Modern airplanes, automobiles, or medical devices are practically networks of computers. Sensors, robots, and intelligent devices are abundant. Human life depends on them. CPS systems transform how people interact with the physical world just like the Internet transformed how people interact with one another.  
 The joint workshop aims to bring together all those researchers with an interest in software engineering, both with CPS and broader focus. Traditionally, these workshops attract industrial and government practitioners and academics pursuing the advancement of software engineering principles, techniques and practices. This joint edition will also provide a forum for reporting on past experiences, for describing new and emerging results and approaches, and for exchanging ideas on best practice and future directions.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 About the Conference  
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.  
    Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering.  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing.  
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM.  
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences.  
 ALENEX will be held jointly with:  
  ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)   
  SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 Call For Papers  
 The ACM SIGCOMM 2025 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions or significant deployment experiences in communication networks and networked systems. SIGCOMM takes a broad view of networking which includes (but is not limited to):  
  
  All types of computer networks, including mobile, wide-area, data center, embedded, home, and enterprise networks. 
  All types of wired and wireless technologies, including optics, radio, acoustic, and visible light-based communication. 
  All aspects of networks and networked systems, such as network architecture, packet-switched and circuit-switched hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, resource management, performance, energy consumption and environmental impact, topology, robustness, security, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics, evolution, and interactions with applications. 
  All parts of the network life cycle, including planning, designing, building, operating, troubleshooting, migrations, and end-of-life. 
  All approaches and techniques, including theory, analysis, experimentation, and AI/machine learning. 
   
  SIGCOMM 2025 will accept submissions in two  tracks: research and experience.  
  
  Strong research track  submissions will significantly advance the state of the art in networking by, for instance, proposing and developing novel ideas or by rigorously evaluating or re-evaluating existing ideas. Strong experience track  submissions will present key insights found in the course of executing deployments of networking techniques, especially in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate (for instance, for reasons of scale). Survey  and tutorial  papers are out of scope.  
  
  All submissions must be anonymous  , i.e., not reveal author names. Experience submissions, however, may reveal the name of the deploying organization or the deployed system. All authors must be listed in HotCRP before the submission deadline so that reviewer conflicts are handled properly.  
  
  At paper registration time, authors must explicitly choose in the submission form whether their paper is to be considered for the research, or experience track. Each submission will only be considered for the one track identified at submission time.  
  Submissions  
   
 Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.  
  
  Submissions and final papers may include appendices (following references, not counting against the 12 pages). Reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is complete and self-contained. For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result. Appendices may also include non-traditional material, such as videos, datasets, and code, all appropriately anonymized.  
  
  Accepted papers may be shepherded by a member of the program committee to ensure reviewer feedback is appropriately addressed. The shepherd will also review appendices and must approve their necessity.  
  
  SIGCOMM 2025 plans to be an in-person event, and the authors of every accepted paper are expected to arrange for an in-person attendee to present the paper and answer questions.  
  
  For accepted papers, the official publication date is the earlier among (1) the first day of the SIGCOMM conference or (2) the day that the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or posted online at SIGCOMM.org. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference and may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  
  Detailed submission instructions can be found on the SIGCOMM 2025 website.  
  
  Submission site: https://sigcomm25.hotcrp.com   
  Non-paper Sessions  
   
 We are continuing the tradition of “non-paper” sessions created in 2024. Non-paper sessions bring together a group of speakers to present on topics relevant to the SIGCOMM community that are not research or experience papers. Topics may include (but are not limited to) discussions of the research process, networking education and teaching, mentorship, history of networking, or outreach to members of the broader networking community not normally included within the SIGCOMM conference. Non-paper sessions will be selected from submissions of short proposals, the details of which will be on the SIGCOMM 2025 website.  
  New this year  
   
 SIGCOMM shorts:  A small number of the submissions will be invited to present a “lightning” talk at SIGCOMM’25 and a shorter version of the submission which will be included in the conference proceedings (up to two pages excluding references and appendices). The goal of SIGCOMM shorts is to provide a venue for submissions that could not be accepted in their larger form but nevertheless were considered to be promising by the program committee. At submission time, authors may explicitly indicate if their submission can be considered as a short. SIGCOMM “shorts” will not be considered conference publications, and as such conference-length papers that overlap with the content in a “short” can be submitted to other conferences. Please consult the ACM SIGCOMM policy  on considerations for reviewing extended papers.  
  
  One-shot revision:  A small number of submissions may be invited to a one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at SIGCOMM. Authors will be given a deadline (approximately 1.5 months after the revision request is issued) to submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions. This process will be managed by a shepherd selected by the PC. The authors will be invited to resubmit a revised manuscript that addresses the referees’ comments. Upon resubmission, authors are encouraged to provide a point-by-point rebuttal to the points raised by the referees, a version of the manuscript in which changes are suitably marked, and a list of changes made to the manuscript. In the rebuttal to the referees, authors should be succinct, yet thorough. The revised paper will be reviewed to judge whether it addresses all of the requested revision requirements. This review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as earlier. To enable this, PC members who give one-shot-revision decisions are obligated to participate in the revision process. Revised papers can only receive a decision of accept or reject; this is what makes the revisions "one-shot."  
  
  A revise-and-resubmit decision is not a guarantee for eventual acceptance. While revised papers that satisfy the revision instructions are expected to be accepted, they can be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed or if the revised version unveils new significant concerns that were not discovered during the earlier reviews.  
  
  During the revision period, the paper is still considered under review to SIGCOMM and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.  
  Ethics and Policy  
   
 All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement or subsection about ethical issues raised by the work. In limited cases this could simply be a sentence disclaiming ethical issues, but work involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic, social network information, censorship evasion) must clearly discuss the relevant issues. Papers that do not include an ethics statement may be rejected.  
  
  Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. Misrepresentation, plagiarism, and coercion and abuse related to authorship or review are unacceptable at SIGCOMM. Works must also show respect for norms around privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent for human subjects and users who might be placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  and the ACM ethics policy  for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007  helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.  
  
  Authors should also consult ACM Publications Policies  and ACM Policy on Authorship  , especially those around Authors; Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification; Research Involving Human Subjects; Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions; Coercion and Abuse; and the use of Generative AI in papers. Carefully review the following statements:  
 “By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new | Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.” 
  “Please ensure that you and your co-authors | obtain an ORCID ID | , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a | commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors | . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.” 
   
  Many organizations have an ethics review process, sometimes called an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and in many projects, IRB involvement is appropriate. IRB approval of research is an important factor and should be mentioned, but the program committee will independently evaluate the ethical soundness of the work just as they evaluate its technical soundness.  
  
  The Program Committee takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and the PC chairs may reach out to authors during the review process if questions arise.  
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
   
 The authors of accepted SIGCOMM 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on paper acceptance, but it is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found on the SIGCOMM 2025 website.

 SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.  
 Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.

 SIGCSE TS 2025: Leading the Transformation  
   
 Welcome!   
 The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS) is organized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and is the organization’s flagship conference. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction.  
 SIGCSE TS 2025 will be held from February 26 - March 01, 2025, at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. SIGCSE TS 2025 will be primarily an in-person conference, though there will be limited online participation options.  
 Hybrid Options for 2025   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 will continue to be a hybrid event. Some aspects of the conference will be only available to in-person attendees. However, online participants will be able to participate in:  
 Keynotes 
  A selection of panels and special sessions 
  A selection of live online paper presentations 
  A selection of online tutorials 
  Nifty Assignments 
  The legendary SIGCSE Coffee Break Show 
  The online conference communication platform 
  Our hope is that this will give everyone an opportunity to present their research at the 2025 SIGCSE Technical Symposium, even if they are unable to travel, and that it will provide an affordable option to enjoy some of the symposium’s content for those that can’t attend in person. The remaining aspects of SIGCSE TS 2025—including BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Posters, and the ACM Student Research Competition—will be offered only in person.   
 Authors of accepted submissions will be required to present their work in-person at the conference  , except for a limited number of papers and tutorials that are scheduled to be virtual.  
 Submission Information   
 We will be using EasyChair  for SIGCSE TS 2025.  
 We are not requiring ACM TAPS  for SIGCSE TS 2025.  
 We will be using the ACM two-column format for papers, posters, panels, special sessions, lightning talks, demos, and the ACM SRC. Tutorials and Birds-of-a-feather submissions will now use forms rather than PDFs. Nifty will continue to expect a zipped folder.  
 Submission Link  : https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2025   
 Reviewing Information   
 To volunteer to review for SIGCSE TS 2025, please visit https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25  . If you are not sure whether or not you have already volunteered to review, please send email to program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .  
 New for 2025   
 SIGCSE-Style Workshops are now called Tutorials  : We are now referring to these three-hour interactive sessions as “Tutorials”. The submission and review process will otherwise be the same as they were last year. (Explanation: We’ve heard some confusion between SIGCSE-Style Workshops and “Workshops” that are intended to be a collection of papers.)  
 New/clarified AI Policies  : Please visit the Policies on Generative AI, LLMs, and Related Tools  menu item under the Info menu for more details.  
 Clarifications on Paper Tracks  : We’ve set up a new menu item, Choosing a Track  , to provide information on which paper track might be most appropriate. Also feel free to reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .  
 Earlier Deadlines  : Unfortunately, with SIGCSE TS occurring about three weeks earlier this year than last year, as well as the ever-increasing number of submissions, we have had to move the paper deadlines to mid/late July.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .

  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims.

 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI)

  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated

  You might also want to click on “Show Reviews”, where you can see other reviews and comments, update your review, and add a comment.  
 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

22. Conference SIGCOMM_1:
Call For Papers  
 The ACM SIGCOMM 2025 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions or significant deployment experiences in communication networks and networked systems. SIGCOMM takes a broad view of networking which includes (but is not limited to):  
  
  All types of computer networks, including mobile, wide-area, data center, embedded, home, and enterprise networks. 
  All types of wired and wireless technologies, including optics, radio, acoustic, and visible light-based communication. 
  All aspects of networks and networked systems, such as network architecture, packet-switched and circuit-switched hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, resource management, performance, energy consumption and environmental impact, topology, robustness, security, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics, evolution, and interactions with applications. 
  All parts of the network life cycle, including planning, designing, building, operating, troubleshooting, migrations, and end-of-life. 
  All approaches and techniques, including theory, analysis, experimentation, and AI/machine learning. 
   
  SIGCOMM 2025 will accept submissions in two  tracks: research and experience.  
  
  Strong research track  submissions will significantly advance the state of the art in networking by, for instance, proposing and developing novel ideas or by rigorously evaluating or re-evaluating existing ideas. Strong experience track  submissions will present key insights found in the course of executing deployments of networking techniques, especially in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate (for instance, for reasons of scale). Survey  and tutorial  papers are out of scope.  
  
  All submissions must be anonymous  , i.e., not reveal author names. Experience submissions, however, may reveal the name of the deploying organization or the deployed system. All authors must be listed in HotCRP before the submission deadline so that reviewer conflicts are handled properly.  
  
  At paper registration time, authors must explicitly choose in the submission form whether their paper is to be considered for the research, or experience track. Each submission will only be considered for the one track identified at submission time.  
  Submissions  
   
 Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.  
  
  Submissions and final papers may include appendices (following references, not counting against the 12 pages). Reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is complete and self-contained. For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result. Appendices may also include non-traditional material, such as videos, datasets, and code, all appropriately anonymized.  
  
  Accepted papers may be shepherded by a member of the program committee to ensure reviewer feedback is appropriately addressed. The shepherd will also review appendices and must approve their necessity.  
  
  SIGCOMM 2025 plans to be an in-person event, and the authors of every accepted paper are expected to arrange for an in-person attendee to present the paper and answer questions.  
  
  For accepted papers, the official publication date is the earlier among (1) the first day of the SIGCOMM conference or (2) the day that the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or posted online at SIGCOMM.org. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference and may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  
  Detailed submission instructions can be found on the SIGCOMM 2025 website.  
  
  Submission site: https://sigcomm25.hotcrp.com   
  Non-paper Sessions  
   
 We are continuing the tradition of “non-paper” sessions created in 2024. Non-paper sessions bring together a group of speakers to present on topics relevant to the SIGCOMM community that are not research or experience papers. Topics may include (but are not limited to) discussions of the research process, networking education and teaching, mentorship, history of networking, or outreach to members of the broader networking community not normally included within the SIGCOMM conference. Non-paper sessions will be selected from submissions of short proposals, the details of which will be on the SIGCOMM 2025 website.  
  New this year  
   
 SIGCOMM shorts:  A small number of the submissions will be invited to present a “lightning” talk at SIGCOMM’25 and a shorter version of the submission which will be included in the conference proceedings (up to two pages excluding references and appendices). The goal of SIGCOMM shorts is to provide a venue for submissions that could not be accepted in their larger form but nevertheless were considered to be promising by the program committee. At submission time, authors may explicitly indicate if their submission can be considered as a short. SIGCOMM “shorts” will not be considered conference publications, and as such conference-length papers that overlap with the content in a “short” can be submitted to other conferences. Please consult the ACM SIGCOMM policy  on considerations for reviewing extended papers.  
  
  One-shot revision:  A small number of submissions may be invited to a one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at SIGCOMM. Authors will be given a deadline (approximately 1.5 months after the revision request is issued) to submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions. This process will be managed by a shepherd selected by the PC. The authors will be invited to resubmit a revised manuscript that addresses the referees’ comments. Upon resubmission, authors are encouraged to provide a point-by-point rebuttal to the points raised by the referees, a version of the manuscript in which changes are suitably marked, and a list of changes made to the manuscript. In the rebuttal to the referees, authors should be succinct, yet thorough. The revised paper will be reviewed to judge whether it addresses all of the requested revision requirements. This review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as earlier. To enable this, PC members who give one-shot-revision decisions are obligated to participate in the revision process. Revised papers can only receive a decision of accept or reject; this is what makes the revisions "one-shot."  
  
  A revise-and-resubmit decision is not a guarantee for eventual acceptance. While revised papers that satisfy the revision instructions are expected to be accepted, they can be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed or if the revised version unveils new significant concerns that were not discovered during the earlier reviews.  
  
  During the revision period, the paper is still considered under review to SIGCOMM and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.  
  Ethics and Policy  
   
 All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement or subsection about ethical issues raised by the work. In limited cases this could simply be a sentence disclaiming ethical issues, but work involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic, social network information, censorship evasion) must clearly discuss the relevant issues. Papers that do not include an ethics statement may be rejected.  
  
  Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. Misrepresentation, plagiarism, and coercion and abuse related to authorship or review are unacceptable at SIGCOMM. Works must also show respect for norms around privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent for human subjects and users who might be placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  and the ACM ethics policy  for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007  helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.  
  
  Authors should also consult ACM Publications Policies  and ACM Policy on Authorship  , especially those around Authors; Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification; Research Involving Human Subjects; Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions; Coercion and Abuse; and the use of Generative AI in papers. Carefully review the following statements:  
 “By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new | Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.” 
  “Please ensure that you and your co-authors | obtain an ORCID ID | , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a | commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors | . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.” 
   
  Many organizations have an ethics review process, sometimes called an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and in many projects, IRB involvement is appropriate. IRB approval of research is an important factor and should be mentioned, but the program committee will independently evaluate the ethical soundness of the work just as they evaluate its technical soundness.  
  
  The Program Committee takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and the PC chairs may reach out to authors during the review process if questions arise.  
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
   
 The authors of accepted SIGCOMM 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on paper acceptance, but it is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found on the SIGCOMM 2025 website.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. 
  Missing or noisy data is addressed. 
  Claims are well supported by the data presented. 
  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why 
  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. 
  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. 
  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative 
  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. 
 Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education 
  Quantitative research should discuss generalizability or transferability of findings beyond the original context. 
  Qualitative research should add deeper understanding about a specific context or problem 
  For novel projects, the contribution beyond prior work is explained 
  For replications, the contribution includes a discussion on the implications of the new results– | even if null or negativ | e–when compared to prior work | Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained 
  The work enables adoption by other practitioners 
  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented 
  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated | The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices 
  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. 
 Presentation  Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission. | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate 
  
 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. 
  Missing or noisy data is addressed. 
  Claims are well supported by the data presented. 
  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why 
  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. 
  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. 
  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative 
  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. 
 Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education 
  Quantitative research should discuss generalizability or transferability of findings beyond the original context. 
  Qualitative research should add deeper understanding about a specific context or problem 
  For novel projects, the contribution beyond prior work is explained 
  For replications, the contribution includes a discussion on the implications of the new results– | even if null or negativ | e–when compared to prior work | Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained 
  The work enables adoption by other practitioners 
  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented 
  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated | The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices 
  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. 
 Presentation  Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission. | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate 
  
 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

 Getting ready   
 Read over the tab called | “Choosing a Track” | to be certain that you have chosen the appropriate track for submission of your paper. | Refer to the track descriptions on the About tab 
  Make sure that all authors have obtained an | ORCiD | identifier. These identifiers may be required for paper submission. 
  Check the author list carefully now and review with your co-authors. The authors on the submission must be the same as the authors on the final version of the work (assuming the work is accepted). Authors may not be added or removed after submission and must also appear in the same order as in the submission. 
  Identify | at least one author who is willing to review for the symposium | . Have that author or those authors sign up to review at | https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25 | . (If they’ve done so already, there is no need to fill out the form a second time.) | Researchers listed as co-authors on three or more submissions must volunteer to review. | (Undergraduate co-authors are exempt from this requirement.) 
  Download the | appropriate template. | Check this Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.

  Click on the appropriate link in the “Update Review” column. 
  You might also want to click on “Show Reviews”, where you can see other reviews and comments, update your review, and add a comment.  
 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. 
  Missing or noisy data is addressed. 
  Claims are well supported by the data presented. 
  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why 
  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. 
  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. 
  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative 
  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. 
 Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education

 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

  You might also want to click on “Show Reviews”, where you can see other reviews and comments, update your review, and add a comment.  
 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD

 Call for Papers  
 The 23rd Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2022) will be held as a hybrid conference  at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and online between September 7-9, 2022.  
 The SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting edge research in dialogue and discourse to both academic and industry researchers. Continuing a series of 22 successful previous meetings, this conference spans the research interest areas of discourse and dialogue. The conference is sponsored by the SIGdial organization, which serves as the Special Interest Group in discourse and dialogue for both ACL and ISCA.  
  Topics of Interest  
 We welcome formal, corpus-based, implementation, experimental, or analytical work on discourse and dialogue including, but not restricted to, the following themes:  
 Discourse Processing | Rhetorical and coherence relations, discourse parsing and discourse connectives. Reference resolution. Event representation and causality in narrative. Argument mining. Quality and style in text. Cross-lingual discourse analysis. Discourse issues in applications such as machine translation, text summarization, essay grading, question answering and information retrieval. 
  Dialogue Systems | Open domain, task oriented dialogue, and chat systems. Knowledge graphs and dialogue. Dialogue state tracking and policy learning. Social and emotional intelligence. Dialogue issues in virtual reality and human-robot interaction. Entrainment, alignment and priming. Generation for dialogue. Style, voice, and personality. Spoken, multi-modal, embedded, situated, and text/web based dialogue systems, their components, evaluation and applications. 
  Corpora, Tools and Methodology | Corpus-based and experimental work on discourse and dialogue, including supporting topics such as annotation tools and schemes, crowdsourcing, evaluation methodology and corpora. 
  Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modeling | Pragmatics or semantics of discourse and dialogue (i.e., beyond a single sentence), e.g., rational speech act, conversation acts, intentions, conversational implicature, presuppositions. 
  Applications of Dialogue and Discourse Processing Technology 
   Submissions  
 The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers, short papers, and demo descriptions. Papers submitted as long papers may be accepted as long papers for oral presentation or long papers for poster presentation. Accepted short papers will be presented as posters.  
 Long paper submissions | must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title, text, figures and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. Two additional pages are allowed for appendices containing sample discourses/dialogues and algorithms, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments. 
  Short paper submissions | must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution; a negative result; or an interesting application nugget. Short papers should be no longer than 4 pages including title, text, figures and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. One additional page is allowed for sample discourses/dialogues and algorithms, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments. 
  Demo descriptions | should be no longer than four pages including title, text, examples, figures, tables and references. A separate one-page document should be provided to the program co-chairs for demo descriptions, specifying furniture and equipment needed for the demo. 
  Authors are encouraged to also submit additional accompanying materials, such as corpora (or corpus examples), demo code, videos and sound files.  
 Multiple Submissions   
 SIGDIAL 2022 cannot accept work for publication or presentation that will be (or has been) published elsewhere and that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications whose review periods overlap with that of SIGDIAL. Any questions regarding submissions can be sent to program-chairs [at] sigdial.org.  
 Blind Review   
 Building on previous years’ move to anonymous long and short paper submissions, SIGDIAL 2022 will follow the ACL policies for preserving the integrity of double blind review (see author guidelines  ). Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous. Demo descriptions should include the authors’ names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.  
 Submission Format   
 All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the two-column ACL format, which are available as an Overleaf template  and also downloadable directly  (Latex and Word)  
 Submissions must conform to the official ACL style guidelines, which are contained in these templates. Submissions must be electronic, in PDF format.  
 Submission Link and Deadline   
 SIGDIAL will accept regular submissions through the softconf system, as well as commitment of already reviewed papers through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system.  
 Regular submission:  
 Authors have to fill in the submission form in the START system  and upload an initial pdf of their papers before May 11, 2022 (23:59 GMT-11).   
 For special session long and short papers please select the session for “Submission Type”.  
 Commitment via ACL Rolling Review (ARR)  :  
 Please refer to the ARR Call for Papers  for detailed information about submission guidelines to ARR. The commitment deadline for SIGDIAL 2022 ( deadline for authors to submit their reviewed papers, reviews, and meta-review to SIGDIAL 2022  ) is June 18, 2022. Note that the paper needs to be fully reviewed by ARR in order to make a commitment, thus the latest date for ARR submission will be April 15, 2022  .  
 Mentoring   
 Acceptable submissions that require language (English) or organizational assistance will be flagged for mentoring, and accepted with a recommendation to revise with the help of a mentor. An experienced mentor who has previously published in the SIGDIAL venue will then help the authors of these flagged papers prepare their submissions for publication.  
  Best Paper Awards   
 In order to recognize significant advancements in dialogue/discourse science and technology, SIGDIAL 2022 will include best paper awards. All papers at the conference are eligible for the best paper awards. A selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.

 The Non-Uniform Distribution of User’s Calls in Time & Space: heterogeneous wireless networks  
 In heterogeneous network environment integrated multiple radio access technology, the nonuniform distribution of users’ calls in time and space is the important factor affecting the performance of heterogeneous wireless network. In order to improve the performance of heterogeneous wireless network, a novel dynamic load balance scheme based on access selection and calls transfer was proposed. In this paper, access selection was modeled as a constrained optimization problem, the access calls was assigned to all base station evenly in accordance with the optimization result. In addition, in order to weaken the destructiveness of sudden calls from hot area to the system load balance, a calls transfer strategy based on the threshold of base station load rate was given. Experimental result shows that the proposed solution performs better than literature solutions in access blocking rate, calls dropping rate, load balance and system utilization rate, and has the advantage of good application value

  Deadlines and Submission 
  Posters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not be previously published, as a paper or a poster.  
 Any topic relevant to the conference focus areas is suitable for presentation as a poster. These include new results and insights around developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses. However, the topic should lend itself to presentation in poster format with additional details available in a handout or web page. You might consider a poster presentation of teaching materials that you would like to share or preliminary research findings, such as:  
 imaginative assignments 
  innovative curriculum design 
  laboratory materials 
  effective ideas for recruiting and retaining students 
  pilot study completed 
  data collected, initial results 
  computing education research that is in a preliminary stage 
  Graduate or undergraduate students submitting posters may instead wish to submit to the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) held at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Like normal posters, ACM SRC posters are displayed at the conference, but the top poster authors also present their work orally, may win prizes and proceed to the international ACM Student Research Competition. Authors should submit to only one of the two tracks (posters or SRC), not to both. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 One author of each accepted poster submission must present their work in-person at the conference. There will be no remote poster presentations.

 Session Duration | 2 hours 

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Poster submissions can be up 2-pages long and must include: a 250-word short abstract, additional content about the work, and references.  
 Authors may find it useful to read the Instruction for Reviewers  and the Review Form  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts   
 All poster submissions must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with the submission metadata, and it should be included in the PDF version of the submission at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 All poster submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).   
 Here is a Sample Poster Submission  , which is formatted using this template with optional line numbers. It also has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Poster submissions are limited to a maximum of 2 pages of content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, supplemental material, and references).  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries should include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, and email address), followed by an abstract, body content, and references. For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information should be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (i.e. one block per author, with four lines for name, institution, address, and email; not more than three columns of blocks). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers.  
 Other requirements:  Include space for authors’ e-mail addresses on separate lines. Even if multiple authors have the same affiliation, grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ‘e-mail alias’ is not acceptable, e.g., {anon1,anon2,anon3}@university.edu  or firstname.lastname@college.org  . NOTE: Poster submissions may omit the following sections from the standard ACM template: keywords, CCS Concepts  . Update since 2024:  Because Poster submissions are 2-pages long this year, they should include BOTH the ACM Copyright Block and the ACM Reference Format.   
 Desk rejects:  Submissions that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the submission  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the submission with an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the submission. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the submission to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 Submissions to the poster track are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. This discussion information can be used by the track chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final acceptance decisions.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. See also the authorship policies  .  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.  
   
 Author Checklist  
   
 Additional details are in the instructions for authors  .   
 Getting ready   
 Make sure that all authors have obtained an | ORCiD | identifier. These identifiers are required for paper submission. 
  Check the author list carefully now and review with your co-authors. The authors on the submission must be the same as the authors on the final version of the work (assuming the work is accepted). Authors may not be added or removed after submission and must also appear in the same order as in the submission. 
  Identify at least one author who is willing to review for the symposium. Have that author or those authors sign up to review at | https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25 | . (If they’ve done so already, there is no need to fill out the form a second time.) | Researchers listed as co-authors on three or more submissions must volunteer to review. | (Undergraduate co-authors are exempt from this requirement.) 
  Download an appropriate template. (see | Instructions for Authors | ) 
  Review Additional Format Instructions in Instructions for Authors Tab- be sure you have included all required items. 
  Review the | additional resources | . 
  Review the | instructions for reviewers | and the | Review Form | to see what reviewers will be looking for in your paper. 
  Look at the list of topics in the Info menu on this site or on EasyChair and pick 3-7 appropriate topics for your submission. 
  Look at the | EasyChair submission page | to make sure you’ll be prepared to fill everything out. Note that you are permitted to update your submission until the deadline, so it is fine to put draft information there as you get ready. 
  IMPORTANT: no author names should be added to the PDF of your submission as the review process is double-anonymous. 
  The submission on EasyChair   
 Note  : EasyChair does not let you save incomplete submission forms. Please fill out all of the fields in one sitting and save them. After that, you can continue to update the information in the fields and your submission until the deadline.   
 Use an appropriate template. 
  Ensure that your submission is accessible. See | accessibility tips for authors | for further details. 
  Ensure that your submission does not exceed the page limit. 
  For the double anonymous review process, ensure that your submission contains no author names or affiliations, but that you have left space for them, as per the instructions for authors. 
  The authors list in the EasyChair submission form should match exactly what you plan the non-anonymized author list to be in your camera-ready final submission (if the submission is accepted). Author lists can NOT be modified (this includes add/remove/reorder) 
  Submit the final version | by 11:59 p.m. AOE, Monday, 14 October 2024. 
    
 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 What Gets Published?   
 The full 2-page extended abstract for each accepted poster will be published in the SIGCSE TS 2025 proceedings.  
 Presentation Details   
 By SIGCSE policy, at least one  author of an accepted poster is required to register, attend, and present the work. SIGCSE TS 2025 posters will be presented only in-person.  
 Please print your poster in advance and bring it with you to the conference. The poster board size is 4 foot tall by 8 foot wide (48in x 96in), so a standard 36" by 48” poster would work well. Please arrive 15-20 minutes before your session to get set up. Each poster station will have push pins available. Please take down and remove your poster at the end of the session. At least one of the Poster Track Co-Chairs will be present at each session.

  Overview   
 Posters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not be previously published (neither as a paper nor as a poster).  
 Poster submissions will be reviewed using the dual-anonymous review process (see below).  
 Submission and Review System   
 The review process for SIGCSE TS 2025 will be done using the EasyChair submission system ( https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigcsets2025  ). Reviewers will be invited to join/login into EasyChair, update their profile, and select 3-5 topics that they are most qualified to review. To do so, reviewers select SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My topics from the menu and select at most 5 topics. More topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest by selecting SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My Conflicts.  
 Dual-Anonymous Review Process   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the submission. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the submission with an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the submission. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the submission to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 Submissions to the Posters track are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process. The reviewers are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. An Associate Program Chair (APC) will help move the discussion forward. This discussion information can be used by the Track Chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final decisions.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 Getting Started Reviewing   
 Before starting your review, you may be asked by the Track Chairs to declare conflicts with any submitting authors. Please do so in a timely manner so we can avoid conflicts during assignment.  
 As a Reviewer, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes what you believe the submission to be about. When reviewing a submission, consider:  
 the strengths and weaknesses, 
  the contribution to an outstanding SIGCSE TS 2025 program and experience for attendees, and 
  how it brings new ideas or extends current ideas through replication to the field and to practitioners and researchers of computing education. 
  Poster Review Guidelines   
 Keep in mind that posters are meant to be a place to present and receive feedback on work that is in progress. Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.  
 Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work; provide their familiarity with the submission topic; evaluate the contribution, background and relation work, approach and uniqueness, and results and conclusions; provide written comments including strengths and weaknesses of the submissions; and provide an overall evaluation.  
 We strongly recommend that you prepare your review in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 While your review text should clearly support your scores and recommendation, please do not include your preference for acceptance or rejection of a submission in the feedback to the authors. Instead, use the provided radio buttons to make a recommendation (the authors will not see this) based on your summary review and provide any details that refer to your recommendation directly in the confidential comments to the APC or Track Chairs. Remember that as a reviewer, you will only see a small portion of the submissions, so one that you recommend for acceptance may be rejected when considering the other reviewer recommendations and the full set of submissions.  
 Poster Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Posters   
 As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Track Chairs.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Submit Topics and Conflicts   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize posters for review assignment. Reviewers and APCs enter conflicts. Note that these steps MUST be completed for the Poster Track even if they were already completed for another track. The topics and conflicts do not propagate across tracks.  
 Step 3: Track Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Track Chairs will quickly review each poster submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, formatting requirements, or length restrictions. Authors of desk-rejected posters will be notified immediately. The Track Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Track Chairs at posters@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Track Chairs, in consultation with the Program Chairs, will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Track Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected posters, leaving the decision to the other Track Chair.  
 Step 4: Track Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 The Track Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC for each poster submission. The Track Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Track Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 5a: Reviewers Review Posters   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Poster Reviewing Guidelines  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.  Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text.  (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, APCs, and Track Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the posters for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 5b: APCs and Track Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Track Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, Track Chairs send email reminders to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs and Track Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 6: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take a leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Track Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all posters assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Poster Reviewing Guidelines | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the poster 
  Step 7: Track Chairs & Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 The Track Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews to ensure clarity and as much consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. APCs are consulted if needed. Poster submissions do not receive meta-reviews in general, but in a small number of cases Track Chairs may write brief meta-reviews to share their interpretation of reviews. The Track Chairs make recommendations to the Program Chairs based on the reviews and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program. The Program Chairs then make final decisions and notify all authors of the decisions about their posters via the submission system.  
 Step 8: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia. The Track Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 Discussion   
 The discussion and recommendation period provides the opportunity for the Track Chairs to discuss reviews and feedback so they can provide the best recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs and that the submission is given full consideration in the review process. We ask that Reviewers engage in discussion when prompted by other reviewers, the APC, or the Track Chairs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair. During this period you will be able to revise your review based on the discussion, but you are not required to do so.  
 The Track Chairs will make a final recommendation to the Program Chairs from your feedback.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. 
  Missing or noisy data is addressed. 
  Claims are well supported by the data presented. 
  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why 
  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. 
  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. 
  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative 
  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. 
 Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education 
  Quantitative research should discuss generalizability or transferability of findings beyond the original context. 
  Qualitative research should add deeper understanding about a specific context or problem 
  For novel projects, the contribution beyond prior work is explained 
  For replications, the contribution includes a discussion on the implications of the new results– | even if null or negativ | e–when compared to prior work | Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained 
  The work enables adoption by other practitioners 
  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented 
  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated | The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices 
  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. 
 Presentation  Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission. | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate 
  
 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

 Getting ready   
 Read over the tab called | “Choosing a Track” | to be certain that you have chosen the appropriate track for submission of your paper. | Refer to the track descriptions on the About tab 
  Make sure that all authors have obtained an | ORCiD | identifier. These identifiers may be required for paper submission. 
  Check the author list carefully now and review with your co-authors. The authors on the submission must be the same as the authors on the final version of the work (assuming the work is accepted). Authors may not be added or removed after submission and must also appear in the same order as in the submission. 
  Identify | at least one author who is willing to review for the symposium | . Have that author or those authors sign up to review at | https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25 | . (If they’ve done so already, there is no need to fill out the form a second time.) | Researchers listed as co-authors on three or more submissions must volunteer to review. | (Undergraduate co-authors are exempt from this requirement.) 
  Download the | appropriate template. | Check this Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections. 
  Review the | additional resources | for the track. 
  Review the | instructions for reviewers | and the | review forms | to see what reviewers will be looking for in your submission. 
  Look at the list of topics in the Info menu on this site or on EasyChair and pick 3-7 appropriate topics for your submission. This helps in matching reviewers’ expertise with submissions and is different from the next item. 
  Make certain that you have entered CCS concepts in your paper by choosing them from | the ACM Computing Classification System site | . 
  Look at the | EasyChair submission page | to make sure you’ll be prepared to fill everything out. Note that you are permitted to update your submission until the deadline, so it is fine to put draft information there as you get ready.

 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims.

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. 
  Missing or noisy data is addressed. 
  Claims are well supported by the data presented. 
  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why 
  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. 
  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. 
  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative 
  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. 
 Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education 
  Quantitative research should discuss generalizability or transferability of findings beyond the original context. 
  Qualitative research should add deeper understanding about a specific context or problem 
  For novel projects, the contribution beyond prior work is explained 
  For replications, the contribution includes a discussion on the implications of the new results– | even if null or negativ | e–when compared to prior work | Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained 
  The work enables adoption by other practitioners 
  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented 
  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated | The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices 
  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. 
 Presentation  Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission. | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear 
  Overall flow and organization are appropriate 
  
 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

 EasyChair   
 The review process for SIGCSE TS 2025 will be done using the EasyChair submission system ( https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigcsets2025  ) .  
 Preparing to Bid in EasyChair   
 Reviewers will be invited to join/login into EasyChair. Once you have accepted your invitation, you should update your profile, select topics you are most qualified to review, and identify conflicts of interest.  
 Selecting topics  : Select SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My topics  from the menu and select at about five topics you are most qualified to review. Please select no more than seven topics; more topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches.  
 Conflicts of interest  : Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest  by selecting SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My Conflicts  .

 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references and appendices, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments. 
   
 Short paper | submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution; a negative result; or an interesting application nugget. Short papers should be no longer than | 4 pages | including title, text, figures and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references and appendices, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments. 
   
 Demo descriptions | should be no longer than | 4 pages | including title, text, examples, figures, tables and references. A separate one-page document should be provided to the program co-chairs for demo descriptions, specifying furniture and equipment needed for the demo. 
  Note that content that is an important part of the contribution or that is important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in appendices. Reviewers are not required to consider material in appendices.  
 Authors are encouraged to also submit additional accompanying materials, such as corpora (or corpus examples), demo code, videos and sound files.  
   
 Multiple Submissions   
 SIGDIAL 2024 cannot accept work for publication or presentation that will be (or has been) published elsewhere and that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications whose review periods overlap with that of SIGDIAL. Any questions regarding submissions can be sent to program-chairs [at] sigdial.org.  
   
 Blind Review   
 Building on previous years’ move to anonymous long and short paper submissions, SIGDIAL 2024 will follow the ACL policies for preserving the integrity of double blind review ( see author guidelines  ). Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous. Demo descriptions should include the authors’ names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.  
   
 Submission Format   
 All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the two-column ACL format, which are available as an Overleaf template  and also downloadable directly  (Latex and Word)  
 Submissions must conform to the official ACL style guidelines, which are contained in these templates. Submissions must be electronic, in PDF format.  
   
 Submission Deadline   
 SIGDIAL will accept regular submissions through the Softconf/START system, as well as commitment of already reviewed papers through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system.  
 Regular submission | Authors have to fill in the submission form in the Softconf/START system and upload an initial PDF of their papers before | May 17, 2024 | (23:59 GMT-11).

  Deadlines and Submission 
  Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and experiment with the SIGCSE Technical Symposium format. Special sessions should NOT replicate existing session formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, poster sessions, tutorials, etc.) that are part of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Sessions last 75 minutes with only in-person presenters. Some special sessions may be selected for live streaming, with both in-person and online attendees. Within these constraints, the form is yours to design.  
 For example, a special session might be a seminar, a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, or a discussion of strategies proven to improve retention of computing topics. Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and assignments, teaching computer science using culturally relevant pedagogy, experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing outside of North America.  
 Author Restriction  A single author may appear on no more than four total panel and  special session submissions combined. Should more than four submissions be received with a given author, only the first four will be reviewed and all others will be desk rejected. This interim policy is intended to promote greater diversity in authorship on these tracks.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 All authors of accepted panel submissions  in this track must register and be present in-person at the conference. A limited number of Special Sessions will be selected by the chairs for live streaming, but all of the presenters need to be there in the room to facilitate this because what is streamed is from a camera in the conference room.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors may find it useful to read the Instruction for Reviewers  and the Review Form  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts   
 All special session submissions must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair  along with the submission metadata, and it should be included in the PDF version of the submission at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is not participating in the new ACM workflow, template, and production system. All special session submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Page Limits:  Special session submissions are limited to a maximum of 2 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and references).  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. 
  Requirement for Single Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries should include author information, an abstract, body content, references, and placeholders for the ACM Reference Format and copyright blocks. Each author should be defined separately for accurate metadata identification.  
 Other requirements:  Include space for authors’ e-mail addresses whenever possible on separate lines. Even if multiple authors have the same affiliation, grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ‘e-mail alias’ is not  acceptable, e.g., {brian,lina,leenkiat}@university.edu  or firstname.lastname@college.org  . Special session should include from the standard ACM template: keywords, CCS Concepts  and the ACM Reference Format.  
 Desk Rejects:  Submissions that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Additional Format Instructions   
 Authors submitting to the special session track should use the standardized section names and additional formatting information below when preparing the main content of their proposals.  
 Overall objective of the session: | Describe the topic of the special session and explain how the session will be organized (e.g., as a committee report, hands-on exercise, …). Indicate why the proposed session is important and relevant to the SIGCSE community. 
  Outline of the session: | Organize this section by subtopics, activities, or a similar scheme. If more than one participant is involved, label each section of the outline with the name of the participant(s) who will be presenting that section. Note that in the case of a committee report, the presenters might be a subset of the authors. We suggest that you allow at least 40 - 50% of the time for questions and answers or other interaction with the attendees. 
  Expectations: | State the intended audience. Indicate how much the session will cover and what the audience should learn. If feedback from the audience is desired, indicate how it will be elicited. 
  Suitability for a special session: | Include a brief description that justifies the inclusion of this presentation as a special session. Explain why the proposed presentation is better suited for a special session than a paper or panel or other standard track format. 
  References: | Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If references are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines. 
  Single Anonymized Review   
 Submissions to the special session track are reviewed with the single-anonymous review process. Submissions should include author names and affiliations. Thus, the author identities are known to reviewers, but reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been submitted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. This discussion information can be used by the track chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final acceptance decisions.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ).

  Overview   
 Special sessions provide an opportunity for SIGCSE community members to customize and experiment with the Technical Symposium formats. Special sessions should NOT replicate existing formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, lightning talks, and poster sessions). They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. Within these constraints, authors may design a format that meets their session’s goals. For example, a special session might be a tutorial or seminar, a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, a rapid-fire sequence of five-minute talks, or a hands-on demo of dance moves proven to improve retention of computing topics.  
 Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and assignments, teaching computer science in K-12, experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing outside of North America.  
 Criteria used in reviewing the proposals will include the likely level of interest in the session and the suitability and feasibility of the proposed format to its topic. If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the special session description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.  
 Submission and Review System   
 The review process for SIGCSE TS 2025 will be done using the EasyChair submission system ( https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigcsets2025  ). Reviewers will be invited to join/login into EasyChair, update their profile, and select 3-5 topics that they are most qualified to review. To do so, reviewers select SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My topics from the menu and select at most 5 topics. More topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest by selecting SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My Conflicts.  
 Single-Anonymous Review Process   
 Submissions to the Special Sessions track are reviewed with the single-anonymous review process. Submissions should include author names and affiliations. Thus, the author identities are known to reviewers, but reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors. The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed slate anonymously through EasyChair. Information from the discussion will be used by the track chairs in making final acceptance decisions.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 Review Process   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is continuing a review process for Panels, Special Sessions, and Tutorials begun for the 2024 Symposium. Reviewers will be asked to review approximately six proposals. Initial reviews will consist of a single rating (Recommend acceptance, Unsure, Do not recommend acceptance) and a short rationale for that rating. After the initial reviews, the track chairs will propose a slate to accept. In putting together the slate, the chairs will consider ratings, comments (and appropriateness thereof), and the balance of topics. Reviewers will then discuss both the slate of reviews and the complete set of submissions, proposing substitutions as appropriate. Track chairs will then make the determination of the final slate and will write meta-reviews for the authors, based on the initial comments and the discussion.  
 We expect that the broader discussion of the slate will provide a more equitable and transparent review process and that the replacement of individual reviews with meta-reviews will better address issues of potential bias in individual reviews.  
 Getting Started Reviewing   
 Before starting your review, you may be asked by the Track Chairs to declare conflicts with any submitting authors. Please do so in a timely manner so we can avoid conflicts during assignment.  
 After the submission deadline and before reviewing can begin, Reviewers will bid on submissions they are interested in reviewing. Please bid for submissions where the title and abstract are in your area of expertise. Bidding will help with assigning submissions for review that you’re qualified and interested in reviewing! If you do not bid within the allotted time window, we will use topics to assign submissions for review.  
 As a Reviewer, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes what you believe the submission to be about. When reviewing a submission, consider:  
 the strengths and weaknesses, 
  the contribution to an outstanding SIGCSE TS 2025 program and experience for attendees, and 
  how it brings new ideas or extends current ideas through replication to the field and to practitioners and researchers of computing education. 
  Special Session Review Guidelines   
 SIGCSE special session proposals are reviewed using EasyChair. Each proposal is assigned to at least three reviewers.  
 Reviewers provide high-quality reviews for submissions to provide authors with feedback so they may improve their work for presentation or future submissions. While authors will not receive your comments directly, the Track Chairs are likely to use your comments from the rationale in providing advice to the authors. As such, please ensure that all criticism is phrased in a constructive manner.  
 In the initial phase of the review, you will be asked three questions.  
 Recommendation  . Please enter your preliminary recommendation for this submission. After we gather the preliminary recommendations, we will propose a slate of proposals to accept and then ask reviewers to discuss that slate.  
 Rationale  . Please give your rationale for your recommendation. Authors will NOT see your complete rationale. However, track chairs may use text from your rationale in providing feedback to authors.  
 Confidential remarks for the program committee  . If you wish to add any remarks intended only for PC members please write them below. These remarks will only be seen by the PC members having access to reviews for this submission. They will not be sent to the authors. This field is optional.  
 We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 In reviewing proposals, please consider the following.  
 Relevance and Interest | Is the special session topic clearly stated? 
  Are the benefits to the SIGCSE audience clearly indicated? 
  Is the special session topic of interest to the SIGCSE community? 
  Is there a clear audience that would be interested in the session? 
  Structure & Plan for Audience Participation | Is there an overview of the special session structure? 
  Does the proposal state why it is better suited for a special session and how it differs from other formats used in the SIGCSE Technical Symposium (paper presentations, panels, lightning talks, and poster sessions)? 
  Does the proposal identify the intended audience? 
  What interaction with the audience is included in the proposed structure? (the suggestion is to allow 40-50% of the time for some interaction with the audience). 
  Is the plan for hybrid engagement clear, and will the proposed hybrid format be productive and engaging for audience members? 
  Presenter/Leader considerations | Does the proposal clearly identify the presenters/leaders of the special session (i.e., name and affiliation) and describe their expertise related to the topic? 
  Does the proposal clearly describe the role of each participant in relation to the goal and topic of the special session? 
  While your review text should clearly support your scores and recommendation, please do not include your preference for acceptance or rejection of a submission in the feedback to the authors. Instead, use the provided radio buttons to make a recommendation (the authors will not see this) based on your summary review and provide any details that refer to your recommendation directly in the confidential comments to the APC or track chairs.  
 Discussion   
 The discussion and recommendation period provides the opportunity for the Track Chairs to discuss reviews and feedback so they can provide the best recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. During this phase, a proposed slate of Special Sessions will be discussed. The Track Chairs will make a final recommendation to the Program Chairs from your feedback. The Track Chairs will also prepare feedback for the authors based on your review and the discussion.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Review Form  
   
 The review process for round-one single-anonymous submissions (Panels, Special Sessions, and Tutorials) is described in Instructions for Reviewers  . The questions on the pre-discussion form follow. They may change slightly before the review period.   
 Recommendation  : Please enter your preliminary recommendation for this submission. After we gather the preliminary recommendations, we will propose a slate of proposals to accept and then ask reviewers to discuss that slate.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately.

 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

  Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information 
  Deadlines and Submission 
  Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool in the computing content domain. All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  
 Paper Tracks   
 Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  
 Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. 
  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. 
  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. 
  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  
 Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  
 Presentation Modality   
 Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.

 Deadlines and Submission  
  
 Papers submitted to SIGCSE TS 2025 follow a two-step submission process. The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  
 The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  
 Abstracts 
  Submission Templates 
  Double Anonymized Review 
  ACM Policies 
  ORCID IDs 
  Abstracts   
 All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  
 Submission Templates   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  
 All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  
 Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  
 Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  
 MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  
 LaTeX Authors:   
 Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . 
  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. 
  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) 
  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. 
  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  
 Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  
 Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  
 Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   
 Double Anonymized Review   
 Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  
 Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  
 As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  
 Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  
 The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  
 The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  
 ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  
   
 Choosing a Track  
   
 Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   
 Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  
 Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  
  
 Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) 
 Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. 
  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. 
  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience 
  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. 
  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. 
 Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated 
  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate 
  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated 
 Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. 
  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. 
  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? 
  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? 
  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). 
  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. 
  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. 
 Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. 
  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately.

 Example papers   
 There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  
 Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.

 Roles in the Review Process   
 Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. 
  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. 
  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). 
  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  
 The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  
 The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  
 Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   
 There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  
 All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   
 The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .

 Review Process Steps   
 Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   
 Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  
 Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  
 Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. 
  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. 
  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   
 Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  
 Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   
 The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  
 Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   
 Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   
 Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  
 Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  
 Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   
 APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  
 Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   
 The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  
 During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. 
  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper 
  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  
 Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   
 Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  
 APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  
 Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  
 Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   
 Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  
 The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  
 Step 10: Evaluation   
 The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  
 The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  
 We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. 
  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
 Recalcitrant Reviewers   
 Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  
   
 Reviewer FAQ  
   
 These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   
 Anonymity   
 General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   
 I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   
 General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   
 However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   
 In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    
 The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   
 I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   
 Projects involving generative AI   
 The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   
 I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   
 Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   
 May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   
 This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   
 I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.

 Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  
   
 Presentation Details   
 In-person presentations   
 TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  
 Presentation Room & Technology  
 All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  
 You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  
 Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  
 Presentation Session  
 New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  
 Speakers’ Lounge  
 In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  
 Online presentation modality   
 There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  
 The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  
 The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  
 Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  
 There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  
 Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  
 There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  
 The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  
 Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  
   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   
 Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  
 Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   
 Registration:   
 In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  
 Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   
 Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  
 Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD 
  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. 
  Optional Video Presentations   
 Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 Theme: Curious Minds  

 This is the first time SIGGRAPH Asia in Tokyo will present an Art Papers program! The conference theme, “Curious Minds,” applies to both artists exploring new technologies and critics evaluating their effectiveness and meaning. Following our curiosity, we artists have misused systems, hacked devices, devised unusual algorithms and processes, and expressed new colors and forms. What motivates our curiosity, and what are the consequences of our efforts? Why obsess over something that no one else seems to care about, or doesn’t have immediate or practical value? Why do something that someone else finds disturbing? Why here and now? Why you? What roles do artists and critics have in shaping the future of computer graphics and interactive techniques?   

 Join us in Tokyo this December as we delve into the complex tapestry of Curious Minds. Explore how technology can both disrupt and unify, offering new ways to understand and engage with our multifaceted existence and curiosity. Be part of the conversation and connect with the vibrant SIGGRAPH arts community here: Digital Arts Community (DAC) Of SIGGRAPH Asia.

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 About the Conference  
 ACM SIGGRAPH  is a special interest group (SIG) devoted to computer graphics (GRAPH) within the Association for Computing Machinery  (ACM), the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society devoted to advancing computing as a science and a profession. Its annual conference, first held in 1974, is the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques worldwide. At SIGGRAPH 2025, we boldly look toward the future, imagining how humanity and technology will be increasingly connected and examining how we can create a future that connects our physical and digital worlds for the better.

   A Message From the Conference Chair  
 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Every day we find ourselves more deeply immersed in the technology we create. Where computers and data once existed apart from us, they are now interwoven in our lives, powered by the drive of human expression, creativity, and need. The relationship between humanity and technology transforms our world, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. As a community of excellence in technical skill and artistry, we at SIGGRAPH can lead this transformation by shaping a future that unites the physical and digital worlds for the better.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, we stand at the forefront of this progress, embracing it, sharing it, and creating it. We are not just passive participants — we are active co-creators of the future. From the art we bring to life, to the stories we tell across media and unprecedented levels of immersion transforming how we experience the world, SIGGRAPH 2025 is a celebration of our collective drive to connect, comprehend, and express the essence of human experience.  
 Storytelling has always fueled technological breakthroughs, and together, we are writing the next chapter in a legacy that spans over five decades. For 52 years, SIGGRAPH has nurtured the brightest minds and boldest ideas in computer graphics and interactive techniques. And this year, we return to Vancouver, whose modern, urban landscape meets an inspiring nature setting, reminding us that technology, at its best, complements and enhances the natural world.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
   
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
   
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  

 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. The file size of supplementary materials is limited to 500MB.    
   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the references. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the paper PDF, after references. Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their captions (i.e., no tables). Authors can include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Appendices are to be provided as supplemental material, and not part of the paper itself.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

  Authors are encouraged to also submit additional accompanying materials, such as corpora (or corpus examples), demo code, videos and sound files.  
 Multiple Submissions   
 SIGDIAL 2022 cannot accept work for publication or presentation that will be (or has been) published elsewhere and that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications whose review periods overlap with that of SIGDIAL.  
 Any questions regarding submissions can be sent to: sigdial2022pcs _at_ googlegroups.com  
 Blind Review   
 Building on previous years’ move to anonymous long and short paper submissions, SIGDIAL 2022 will follow the ACL policies for preserving the integrity of double blind review (see author guidelines  ). Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous. Demo descriptions should include the authors’ names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.  
 Submission Format   
 All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the two-column ACL format, which are available as an Overleaf template  and also downloadable directly  (Latex and Word)  
 Submissions must conform to the official ACL style guidelines, which are contained in these templates. Submissions must be electronic, in PDF format.  
 Submission Link and Deadline   
 SIGDIAL will accept regular submissions through the softconf system, as well as commitment of already reviewed papers through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system.  
 Regular submission:  
 Authors have to fill in the submission form in the START system  and upload an initial pdf of their papers before May 11, 2022 (23:59 GMT-11).   
 For special session long and short papers please select the session for “Submission Type”.  
 Commitment via ACL Rolling Review (ARR)  :  
 Please refer to the ARR Call for Papers  for detailed information about submission guidelines to ARR. The commitment deadline for SIGDIAL 2022 ( deadline for authors to submit their reviewed papers, reviews, and meta-review to SIGDIAL 2022  ) is June 18, 2022.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  
   
 Back to Top    

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 Call for Candidates for Two Director-at-Large Positions, Treasurer  
 Oct 22, 2024  | News   
   
 Do you have a vision for the future of computer graphics and interactive techniques? ACM SIGGRAPH is run by volunteers and the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee sets the strategic direction for the future of the organization and provides oversight over our organization’s year-round activities. Each year, the membership has the opportunity to vote for three new members for the Executive Committee.  
 The Nominations Committee’s goal is to assemble a slate of candidates for these three roles. The process of assembling a slate of candidates happens over the course of 3-4 months with the aim of finding 2-3 candidates for each position on the slate. The Nominations Committee interviews all prospective candidates. The committee will also sometimes recruit candidates if they feel the need for more representation from a sector of our community.  
 The Nominations Committee is composed of 5-7 ACM SIGGRAPH members and is overseen by the Nominations Committee Chair, who is a non-voting member of the committee. The committee interviews all prospective candidates. Once the interview period is complete, the Nominations Committee puts together a slate that is then sent to ACM.  
 In addition to individual qualifications, the committee takes into consideration the slate as a whole. The process is designed to ensure that membership will have choices that represent different perspectives and communities and that qualified candidates can be identified for specific roles.  
 This year, we are looking for candidates to run for two open Directors-at-Large positions. The committee is looking for candidates who:  
 Are ACM SIGGRAPH members 
  Have a strong perspective about the future of our organization 
  Have a proven track record of successful volunteerism 
  Are collaborative and collegial 
  Are representative of the communities that comprise our organization 
  Are willing to serve a portion of their term as the ACM SIGGRAPH Chair (with the exception of the Treasurer) 
  This year we are also issuing a call for the Treasurer position. The Treasurer provides financial oversight to the organization. Like the Directors at Large positions, the Treasurer serves a 3 year term. The first year of the term is spent as Treasurer-elect, working closely with the current Treasurer to ensure a smooth transition to serving the following two years as the Treasurer.  
 If you are interested in running for the Executive Commitee, would like to nominate someone, or have questions about the process, please reach out. The Nominations Committee Chair can be reached at ec-nominations@siggraph.org  . Nominations for the positions listed above must be made no later than 11:59PM EDT on February 1, 2025. Nominations must be accompanied by the nominee’s name and email address.  
 Visit ACM SIGGRAPH’s Policy Guidelines  to learn more about the nominations and election process.

 The 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval  
  July 13-18, 2025 | Padua, Italy  
 Important Dates 

 Join       
 SIGIR is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in information retrieval. The conference consists of five days of full papers, short papers, resource & reproducibility papers, perspectives papers, system demonstrations, doctoral consortium, tutorials, and workshops focused on research and development in the area of information retrieval.  
  
  SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.

 In Brief  
 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 48th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as an in-person conference from July 13th to 18th, 2025 in Padua, Italy. For the full paper call, we welcome high-impact original papers with contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. Please note CFPs for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2025 venues will be released separately.  
 Important Dates for Full Papers  
 Deadlines time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  
 Full paper abstracts due: January 16, 2025 
  Full papers due: January 23, 2025 
  Full paper notifications: March 28, 2025 
   
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 16, 2025 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 23, 2025 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from other conferences should submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts ("placeholder abstracts").  
 Submission Guidelines  
 See this brief checklist  to strengthen an IR paper, for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2025).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length  (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references), with unrestricted space for references  , in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf  templates are available from the ACM Website  (use sigconf  proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.  
 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}   
 Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025   
 by selecting the “SIGIR 2025 Full Papers”  track.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for SIGIR 2025, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person  .  
 Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit, to SIGIR 2025, papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to the SIGIR 2025 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  . Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 In-Person Attendance Policy  
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.  
 All accepted papers (including all tracks) to the main conference and workshops are expected to be presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper will attend the conference in person to deliver the paper and address audience questions during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted. More information at the SIGIR 2025 In-presence Policy  page.  
 Child Care Service  
 SIGIR 2025 promotes inclusion and attendance also by organizing a child care service, in order to foster work-family balance by offering congress attendees the opportunity to attend events with their children.  
 Children from 0 to 12 years of age are welcomed in a specially set up room inside Padua Congress Center throughout the duration of the congress. A colorful, “warm”, safe and welcoming environment, in the same structure that hosts the congresses, a protected place where parents can leave their children, but at the same time stay in touch with them during the breaks of the different sessions.  
 The nursery space dedicated to the 0-3 age group, equipped with a changing table and other facilities dedicated to the little ones, is next to the kids’ area for children over 3 years old and a cinema room for screenings.  
 The activities are run by a company specialized in education services with expert staff, appointed by Padua Congress Center, and include thematic workshops - from painting to creative activities - as well as playtime also in the open air, in the facility's outdoor spaces. Children are also offered lunch.  
 The service is available - for a fee (depending on sponsors) - to all SIGIR 2025 attendees who request it. For more information and updates, check out the SIGIR 2025 Child Care  page.  
 Authorship Policy  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy  before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship, under any circumstances, will be permitted after the abstract submission deadline or for the camera-ready submission. So please, make sure you have listed authors correctly at abstract submission time.  
 Use of AI  
 All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence  .  
 Desk Rejection Policy  
 Submissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy  , length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty  , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
  Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or links to extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | submit source code for artifact review | . If you need to shared anonymous code, you may use anonymous git repositories, such as | https://anonymous.4open.science/ | . 
  Change of authors after the abstract submission deadline. 
  Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
  Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty. 
  Lack of topical fit for SIGIR.

 IT Education  

 The SIGITE Conference on Information Technology Education occurs every year in late October. The conference generally runs mid-day Thursday through mid-day Saturday. Calls for papers to this conference generally go out in February with papers being due in the Spring.  
 Published Papers  
 Average paper acceptance rate recently (2006-2010) has been 54%. Papers published in the Proceedings of the SIGITE Information Technology Education Conference  primarily address issues around teaching and learning (pedagogy) of IT but also have focused on traditional research. Authors consist of IT faculty, professionals, as well as graduate and undergraduate students.  
 Publication Archive   
 See our publication archive for past SIGITE conferences.   
 See Archive    

 Depending on the conference organizers, these conferences also sometimes have tours of local IT facilities (campus labs or local IT companies) and/or pre or post-conference workshops relating to IT or education.  
 Department Chairs Meeting  
 Preceding the conference, a special meeting is held for Department Chairs of IT academic departments within academic institutions. These IT Department Chairs’ meetings have been growing in popularity each year as they discuss issues related to leading academic IT departments.  
 Student Stipends  
 Travel stipends are available to undergraduate or graduate students whose papers are accepted for publication in the proceedings.

 United States Military Academy, Deputy Head, Dept of EE&CS   

 SIGITE has allowed me to meet educators in the IT community. Because of SIGITE, I was able to start an IT program from scratch and get it accredited in a 4 year span because of wealth of knowledge of its members and their willingness to help. It is also a great venue for my IT faculty to publish and present their accomplishments.    

 Dr. Amber Settle    
 Associate Professor, DePaul University   

 This past weekend I attended and presented at the SIGITE Conference located in Midland, Michigan. It was the second weekend in a row that I was going to be gone, and all of that in the middle of the quarter, so I wasn’t as enthusiastic going into it as I normally am about conferences. As it turns out it was the best conference experience I’ve had in a long time!   
 The sessions at the conference are scheduled so that each talk has a 45-minute slot, with 30 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions. In most of the sessions I attended, including my own, the questions were in fact intermixed with the presentation. And what a difference it makes to have more time and a more interactive environment. I got excellent feedback on my work and was able to provide a lot more background information than was on my slides because of the questions. The questions themselves were also terrific. I was impressed by the insight that the audience members had into the work. I also got good questions and offers for collaborations after the talk, but it was the interactive presentations that really had me hooked.   
 On top of that, I met friendly, intelligent, and insightful people during the breaks, meals, and the reception. I had some of the best conference conversations ever, and I’m hoping that I’ll get a chance to stay in touch with the people I met.  So overall, I highly recommend SIGITE as a conference. Next year it will be at West Point in New York, and they’ve promised private tours of things that even tourists don’t get to see. That combined with the lively and friendly experience make it don’t miss opportunity.    

 Dr. Yan Bai    
 Assistant Professor Institute of Technology University of Washington Tacoma   

 I attended SIGITE’10 held in midland, MI. I really enjoy every session I attended! The conference presenters at SIGITE’10 provide valuable information about the IT program, curricula, courses, and accreditation. Everything about IT education! In particular, I appreciate the opportunity to network IT educators from around the US, and learn many new ideas for laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of IT instruction in the areas of cyber security and information networking. I’m certainly looking forward to SIGITE’11.   

 Ryan Kazmerik    
 Undergraduate Student Mount Royal University, Calgary   

 I am really glad that my paper was accepted and I was able to present at SIGITE 2010 as it gave me a peak into the process of IT education. Often students sometimes think that courses topics and curriculum are picked out of a hat, but the topic I chose exposed me to the same tough problems that the IT community has been dealing with for years.   

 Lani Fraizer

 SIGITE’s growing community of ACM faculty, alumni and students provided me with a strong resource of experts and enthusiasts who champion IT education. What I loved most about SIGITE is that the community and its officers are welcoming and keen on both national, as well as global issues regarding IT education.   

 Dr. Glenn Wilson    
 Associate Research Professor of Technology Director, Information and Innovation University of Maine   

 Having been a long-time member of ACM, I was curious about SIGITE, so I attended the conference in Midland, Michigan this fall. It was a wonderful experience in three aspects. First, and foremost, the quality of presentations and the professional camaraderie among presenters and members was excellent. Secondly, the keynote speaker, CIO of Dow Chemical, was exceptionally informative, particularly as regards the way Dow recruits and situates its IT new-hires. And finally, I felt quite welcome and quickly accepted as new member of SIGITE, and look forward to becoming more involved in this dynamic and high-quality SIG.

 Testimonials   
 Bryan Goda    
 United States Military Academy, Deputy Head, Dept of EE&CS   

 SIGITE has allowed me to meet educators in the IT community. Because of SIGITE, I was able to start an IT program from scratch and get it accredited in a 4 year span because of wealth of knowledge of its members and their willingness to help. It is also a great venue for my IT faculty to publish and present their accomplishments.    

 Dr. Amber Settle    
 Associate Professor, DePaul University   

 This past weekend I attended and presented at the SIGITE Conference located in Midland, Michigan. It was the second weekend in a row that I was going to be gone, and all of that in the middle of the quarter, so I wasn’t as enthusiastic going into it as I normally am about conferences. As it turns out it was the best conference experience I’ve had in a long time!   
 The sessions at the conference are scheduled so that each talk has a 45-minute slot, with 30 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions. In most of the sessions I attended, including my own, the questions were in fact intermixed with the presentation. And what a difference it makes to have more time and a more interactive environment. I got excellent feedback on my work and was able to provide a lot more background information than was on my slides because of the questions. The questions themselves were also terrific. I was impressed by the insight that the audience members had into the work. I also got good questions and offers for collaborations after the talk, but it was the interactive presentations that really had me hooked.   
 On top of that, I met friendly, intelligent, and insightful people during the breaks, meals, and the reception. I had some of the best conference conversations ever, and I’m hoping that I’ll get a chance to stay in touch with the people I met.  So overall, I highly recommend SIGITE as a conference. Next year it will be at West Point in New York, and they’ve promised private tours of things that even tourists don’t get to see. That combined with the lively and friendly experience make it don’t miss opportunity.    

 Dr. Yan Bai    
 Assistant Professor Institute of Technology University of Washington Tacoma   

 I attended SIGITE’10 held in midland, MI. I really enjoy every session I attended! The conference presenters at SIGITE’10 provide valuable information about the IT program, curricula, courses, and accreditation. Everything about IT education! In particular, I appreciate the opportunity to network IT educators from around the US, and learn many new ideas for laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of IT instruction in the areas of cyber security and information networking. I’m certainly looking forward to SIGITE’11.   

 Ryan Kazmerik    
 Undergraduate Student Mount Royal University, Calgary   

 I am really glad that my paper was accepted and I was able to present at SIGITE 2010 as it gave me a peak into the process of IT education. Often students sometimes think that courses topics and curriculum are picked out of a hat, but the topic I chose exposed me to the same tough problems that the IT community has been dealing with for years.   

 Lani Fraizer    
 Synergies in Sync | iWE Project Pepperdine University   

 SIGITE’s growing community of ACM faculty, alumni and students provided me with a strong resource of experts and enthusiasts who champion IT education. What I loved most about SIGITE is that the community and its officers are welcoming and keen on both national, as well as global issues regarding IT education.   

 Dr. Glenn Wilson    
 Associate Research Professor of Technology Director, Information and Innovation University of Maine   

 Having been a long-time member of ACM, I was curious about SIGITE, so I attended the conference in Midland, Michigan this fall. It was a wonderful experience in three aspects. First, and foremost, the quality of presentations and the professional camaraderie among presenters and members was excellent. Secondly, the keynote speaker, CIO of Dow Chemical, was exceptionally informative, particularly as regards the way Dow recruits and situates its IT new-hires. And finally, I felt quite welcome and quickly accepted as new member of SIGITE, and look forward to becoming more involved in this dynamic and high-quality SIG.

 In Brief  
 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 48th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as an in-person conference from July 13th to 18th, 2025 in Padua, Italy. For the full paper call, we welcome high-impact original papers with contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. Please note CFPs for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2025 venues will be released separately.  
 Important Dates for Full Papers  
 Deadlines time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  
 Full paper abstracts due: January 16, 2025 
  Full papers due: January 23, 2025 
  Full paper notifications: March 28, 2025 
   
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 16, 2025 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 23, 2025 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from other conferences should submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts ("placeholder abstracts").  
 Submission Guidelines  
 See this brief checklist  to strengthen an IR paper, for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2025).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length  (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references), with unrestricted space for references  , in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf  templates are available from the ACM Website  (use sigconf  proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.  
 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}   
 Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025   
 by selecting the “SIGIR 2025 Full Papers”  track.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for SIGIR 2025, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person  .  
 Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit, to SIGIR 2025, papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to the SIGIR 2025 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  . Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 In-Person Attendance Policy  
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.  
 All accepted papers (including all tracks) to the main conference and workshops are expected to be presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper will attend the conference in person to deliver the paper and address audience questions during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted. More information at the SIGIR 2025 In-presence Policy  page.  
 Child Care Service  
 SIGIR 2025 promotes inclusion and attendance also by organizing a child care service, in order to foster work-family balance by offering congress attendees the opportunity to attend events with their children.  
 Children from 0 to 12 years of age are welcomed in a specially set up room inside Padua Congress Center throughout the duration of the congress. A colorful, “warm”, safe and welcoming environment, in the same structure that hosts the congresses, a protected place where parents can leave their children, but at the same time stay in touch with them during the breaks of the different sessions.  
 The nursery space dedicated to the 0-3 age group, equipped with a changing table and other facilities dedicated to the little ones, is next to the kids’ area for children over 3 years old and a cinema room for screenings.  
 The activities are run by a company specialized in education services with expert staff, appointed by Padua Congress Center, and include thematic workshops - from painting to creative activities - as well as playtime also in the open air, in the facility's outdoor spaces. Children are also offered lunch.  
 The service is available - for a fee (depending on sponsors) - to all SIGIR 2025 attendees who request it. For more information and updates, check out the SIGIR 2025 Child Care  page.  
 Authorship Policy  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy  before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship, under any circumstances, will be permitted after the abstract submission deadline or for the camera-ready submission. So please, make sure you have listed authors correctly at abstract submission time.  
 Use of AI  
 All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence  .  
 Desk Rejection Policy  
 Submissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy  , length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty  , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable.

 Overview  
 The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13 2025.   
 We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation. The research may target systems in a broad range of domains, including networking, high-performance computing, machine learning, IoT, cloud, edge, multimedia, mobile, and cyber-physical systems. The work may target diverse system metrics such as latency, throughput, reliability, cost, accuracy, fairness, energy, and carbon footprint.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Awards and the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award.

  Deadlines are hard and at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).  
 Papers may be submitted to any deadline and, upon acceptance, papers will be scheduled for publication in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems  (POMACS) and presentation at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft Tracking | : SIGMETRICS uses "soft" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high-performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks,cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site. 
  The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of the claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to "opt out" of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to "opt out", an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS, and submit the paper with an authors' response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 Applied Improvisation Techniques to Enhance IT Majors’ Soft Skills, Communication Skills, and Teamwork Skills   
 Russell McMahon 
  The 2017 Curriculum Guidelines for Baccalaureate Degree Programs in Information Technology now stresses the importance of soft skills (section 5.2.1), communication skills and team skills training for IT majors. Applied improvisation techniques can be used in teaching of technical concepts such as cybersecurity, agile development, database design, programming concepts, and most importantly, how to better one’s communication and teamwork skills. This workshop is designed for those who want to learn more about some of the various techniques used and how they can be incorporated into the IT curriculum. Nearly 20 years ago, the National Academy of Sciences Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) recognized the importance of improvisation as tool to help IT practitioners become more creative. Creative problem-solving methodologies such as design thinking all tie into the use of improvisation. Companies such as Twitter, IDEO, and Google are using improvisation methods as a way of creating better collaborative teams and a work environment that says YES before NO. Improvisation training can help students and faculty to become better listeners, communicators, collaborators, innovators and those who can better focus on the organization or team story and not their own story.

 Technology Leadership in Today’s World   
 Daren Thayne 
  The world needs innovative technology leaders. Virtually every organization relies on technology. And those organizations need innovative technology leaders who not only know how to wear the many and necessary hats, but who also are strategic partners who are fully aligned with the goals of the organization. How has the role of technology leadership changed over time? What are the attributes that define innovative technology leaders? To stay competitive in this world, why is it becoming more and more critical that organizations hire and develop innovative technology leaders?  

 SESSION: Session 3A: Curriculum  
 CC2020: An IT-Centric Overview   
 Barry M. Lunt 
  In 2005, the ACM, together with the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Information Systems, released Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report[1]. This document has proven to be one of the most widely circulated and influential documents ever produced on the topic of computing curricula, and included computing programs in computer engineering (CE), computer science (CS), information systems (IS), information technology (IT), and software engineering (SE). This document was recently updated and released as Computing Curricula 2020: Paradigms for Global Computing Education[2], and included the first 5 computing programs as well as cybersecurity (CSEC) and some of data science (DS). This paper takes an IT-centric look at this updated document highlighting the changes and the additional insights this significant reference provides the computing educational community.  

 Revisiting Syntax Exercises in CS1   
 Anna Ly 
  John Edwards 
  Michael Liut 
  Andrew Petersen 
  Previous work has suggested that adopting a “syntax-first pedagogy” in introductory programming (CS1) improved student retention and performance. To confirm these results we added syntax exercises to an existing CS1 course. A quasi-experimental design was used, with topics with and without a syntax exercise introduction being compared. Data collected includes performance (number of submissions and time spent) on weekly exercises and assignments as well as student evaluations collected weekly and at the end of the term. Our observations suggest that a syntax-first approach improves student performance in the short-term. Students generally performed better on weekly exercises introduced using the syntax exercises, in terms of both the number of submissions required and time spent, than they did on exercises that were not. Furthermore, the reductions in time required to solve the existing weekly exercises partially offset the time required by the new syntax-focused exercises, and students, particularly those with less prior experience, valued the new syntax exercises. Our results suggest that adopting a syntax-first approach may have benefits for students with lower prior experience, and we encourage additional work, both to evaluate a fully-converted syntax-first course and to assess syntax exercises in a more controlled setting.  

 Strategies for Integrating Two-Year Information Technology and Cybersecurity Programs   
 Markus Geissler 
  Cara Tang 
  To meet the high demand for trained Cybersecurity professionals, many two-year colleges which have been offering degree programs in Information Technology (IT) are expanding or revising their course offerings to include Cybersecurity courses. The increasing importance of Cybersecurity skills has led to an increase in Cybersecurity requirements for IT majors. Due to considerations related to competency overlap, vendor-based academy content, government designations, faculty qualifications, general education requirements enrollment capacity, and other factors, two-year colleges are evaluating various options for how to effectively offer both IT and Cybersecurity content. Options include separate IT and Cybersecurity degrees, IT and Cybersecurity concentrations using a common core of general Computing courses, and multiple IT degree concentrations based on a common IT core. Colleges should evaluate the competencies expected of completers to determine how to best structure their programs.

 Equipping and Empowering Faculty through Professional Development to Create a Future-Ready Workforce in Emerging Technologies   
 Farzana Rahman 
  Elodie Billionniere 
  Ann Quiroz Gates 
  Felesia Stukes 
  Tech industry, especially, some areas within tech fields, such as Emerging Technology (EmTech), like cybersecurity, data science, mobile development, machine learning AI, and cloud computing, are expected to experience immense increases in job opportunities in coming years. While a variety of solutions are necessary to address the growing workforce needs in the EmTech industry, one of the largest untapped talent pools is women and underrepresented students. Clearly, HBCU and MSI hold great potential to broaden participation in EmTech because of their more diverse student populations access to a large number of underrepresented students, and closer faculty-to-student interaction. However, faculties at these institutions, who are at the forefront of developing required skills in students are often overlooked. Faculties at these institutions need help designing and implementing effective and evidence-based instruction materials to develop skills that are in high-demand in the EmTech industry. The goal of this panel is to offer a platform that can provide insight into the development of faculty professional development programs in EmTech in traditional institutions and within the context of HBCU and MSI.

 UCLP: A Novel UAV Cybersecurity Laboratory Platform   
 Ashok Raja 
  Julio Galvan 
  Yanyan Li 
  Jiawei Yuan 
  Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their applications in various fields. At the same time, the utilization of UAVs also raises serious security and safety concerns. Given a large number of UAV-related jobs to be created in the near future, it is pressing to educate and train current and next-generation cybersecurity professionals towards UAVs and their applications. However, there is a lack of education and training materials on UAV cybersecurity especially for hands-on practice. In this paper, we propose a novel UAV cybersecurity laboratory platform (UCLP), which provides efficient and effective hands-on practice. UCLP offers not only a cost-effective UAV cybersecurity practice environment, but also a series of designed and pre-configured lab modules. UCLP adopts a plug-in based design and hence supporting flexible customization of existing and new lab modules. UCLP uses technical solutions to overcome non-technical limitations in UAV cybersecurity practice (e.g., regulations of UAV operations). Our evaluation results demonstrated the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of UCLP and indicated UCLP is promising to be integrated into the education and training of UAV, cybersecurity, and related fields.  

 An Online Gamified Learning Platform for Teaching Cybersecurity and More   
 Mac Malone 
  Yicheng Wang 
  Fabian Monrose 
  We present an online gamified learning platform for computer science and cybersecurity education. Exercises within the platform revolve around a custom game wherein students can demonstrate learned skills regarding password security, web security, traffic analysis, reverse engineering, cryptanalysis, and much more. We describe some key features that together make our platform novel, including its distributed infrastructure game engine, integrated development environment, automated feedback system, and support for individualization. We demonstrate how these features assist in the learning process — both in theory and in practice — and report on the use of the platform in a cybersecurity course.  

 Scaring People is Not Enough: An Examination of Fear Appeals within the Context of Promoting Good Password Hygiene   
 Marc Dupuis 
  Anna Jennings 
  Karen Renaud 
  Fear appeals have been used for thousands of years to scare people into engaging in a specific behavior or omitting an existing one. From religion, public health campaigns political ads, and most recently, cybersecurity, fear appeals are believed to be effective tools. However, this assumption is often grounded in intuition rather than evidence. We know little about the specific contexts within which fear appeals may or may not work. In this study, we begin to examine various components of a fear appeal within the context of password hygiene. A large-scale randomized controlled experiment was conducted with one control and three treatment groups: (1) fear only; (2) measures needed and the efficacy of such measures, and (3) fear combined with measures needed and the efficacy of such measures. The results suggest that the most effective way to employ a fear appeal within the cybersecurity domain is by ensuring that fear is not used on its own. Instead, it is important that information on the measures needed to address the threat and the efficacy of such measures is used in combination with information about the nature of the threat. Since many individuals that enter the information technology profession become the de facto security person, it is important for information technology education programs to distill in students the inadequacy of fear, on its own, in motivating secure actions.  

 SESSION: Session 4B: Big Ideas in IT Education  
 Domains and Contexts: Tracks in Introductory Project Management Courses   
 Diane Shichtman 
  Andrew Weiss 
  The fundamentals of project management are the same regardless of the industry or organization. However, in some settings, individual elements of project management might be more or less significant, and teaching students about contexts and domains that are familiar or of interest can help engage them.  

 DevOps: The Sky’s the Limit in Higher Education   
 Christina Hupy 

 How To Avoid Peter and His Principle   
 Hollis Greenberg 
  Does the current recommended computing curricula prepare our students to work in the business world? Technology does not exist in a silo. Technical employees work in departments where they manage projects, people, and budgets. Many computing disciplines solely focus on the technological skills, completely ignoring the other skills necessary to be successful and to achieve upward mobility in the business world.  

 Is Hybrid Teaching Good for Your IT Class?   
 Chunming Gao 
  Bryan Goda 
  This presentation aims to discuss using hybrid approach to engage students’ active learning in IT course teachings.

 Inspiring Student Creativity: Collaboration on a Network Design Using IoT Project   
 Sharon Gumina 
  Hengtao Tang 
  A key initiative of the College of Engineering and Computing at USC is fostering creativity in its students and educators [11]. Emergent technologies make it difficult to predict what skills students will need as computer systems become more complex and dynamic. Including classroom activities that encourage creativity and collaboration prepares students for Information Technology (IT) and real-life application of their networking skills. The Final Project for the Introduction to Networking course that is described in this paper was designed to be a creative teaching experience in the classroom. It also contributed to the Introduction to Networking course learning outcomes by preparing students for risk-taking and uncertainty in real-world network applications  

 An Open Educational Resource for an Agile Software Engineering Course   
 Cengiz Günay 
  Anca Doloc-Mihu 
  The field of software technologies has been seeing a steady growth worldwide recently. Engineering job roles might require candidates to know several different programming paradigms, languages, frameworks, and cloud technologies. Each of these technologies constantly evolve to improve or become obsolete, which requires educational materials for teaching them to be constantly updated. Software engineering has classical texts that have been updated over many editions. These are large volumes with numerous chapters that include older and newer techniques, history, and a variety of extra material which makes them expensive textbooks. This also make them contain too much material to cover in undergraduate courses. As published textbooks are always updated slower than the pace of technology that changes project dependencies every three months or so, practical materials may still become outdated between editions. Open educational resources (OERs) provide solutions to these problems by allowing adopters to update and customize materials for a given syllabus. An OER can simply mean a no-cost textbook or a resource that is publicly available for teaching. In this work, we present a preliminary OER for software development or engineering courses for undergraduate information technology (IT) majors.  

 A Framework for the Discipline of Information Technology   
 Hazem Said 
  Michael Zidar 
  Said Varlioglu 
  Cornelius Itodo 
  This paper presents a framework for the academic discipline of information technology. The framework defines four independent elements to the discipline: People, Information Technology, and the Solutions or Needs that connect them. In IT practice, the information technology discipline aim is the selection, creation, integration, application, security and administration of solutions that use technology to empower people through information. In IT research, the discipline aim is the investigation, discovery, and dissemination of needs that connect people, information, and technology. The proposed framework presents a theory for the discipline of information technology to inform its research and practice. It builds on past efforts to define the information technology discipline and provides a foundation for academic institutions and the industry to proactively address the need for talent and innovation to sustain the economic engine of our society.  

 Block-based Programming Enabling Students to Gain and Transfer Knowledge with a No-code Approach   
 Luis Corral 
  Ilenia Fronza 
  Claus Pahl 
  In this article, we describe our experience designing and teaching a curriculum on mobile software development that has benefitted from the no-code philosophy leveraging the power of block-based programming tools. We review a journey of 10 years using block-based programming platforms to lay foundations on software development skills and empower the creative potential of high school students. Our objective is to provide a review of the evolution, capabilities and technical coverage of the block-based software platforms, and to discuss the impact that we have observed on users and developers who have become acquainted on the use of block-based programming tools through our courses  

 A Computer-Vision Based Engagement Evaluation System for More Effective Learning Design   
 Zhigang Li 
  Jiaming Li 
  Meng Han 
  Ming Yang 
  Student engagement during online instruction has been a challenge. Particularly in an asynchronous learning environment, assessing and measuring student engagement is a difficult task. This paper proposes a solution to fill in the gap between the need to evaluate student engagement during online instruction and the lack of an effective method to do so. The proposed web-based learning environment fully incorporates the latest development in facial expression recognition to capture the facial expression changes during the course of instruction. The facial expression data can then be visualized for further analysis to help instructors pinpoint the exact locations where the instruction needs improvements. In addition, the proposed system can also be used in corporate training settings, particularly in scenarios where the learners’ emotional responses are desired.  

 Creating an Immersive and Active Educational Experience for Generation Z: Adapting the Introductory Information Technology Course for Digital Natives   
 Travis Dalton 
  John Gerdes 
  An introductory information technology (IT) course (ITEC 101) was designed to engage IT students and attract non-degree students. Student feedback suggests an update was needed. A survey gauged student sentiment and solicited positive and negative feedback and recommendations for change. Results suggests students prefer active learning and want more emphasis on meaningful content and assignments. We discuss the course redesign. Active learning is emphasized, incorporating a flipped classroom model to engage and build student enthusiasm for information technology.  

 dbLearn*: Open-Source System and a Set of Practices for Conducting Iterative Exercises and Exams in a Databases Course   
 Vangel Ajanovski 
  The author’s approach in teaching databases, focuses on acquiring competences needed to use and develop systems of realistic complexity, typical for a micro or small company. Each student works towards gaining experience with various database designs and implementations querying and development of relational schemas, and building applications. An open-source system is introduced, intended to help teachers organize such courses at a scale and effectively guide the students in an iterative process of acquiring competencies at the level of smaller groups or even individuals. The main goal of the system is speed-up of administrative tasks at all levels. The system implements the core process of organizing exams in a partial and piece-wise manner, and implements sets of tools and practices for semi-automated assessment processes.  

 Preparing Students for Automated IT Workflows   
 Heidi J. C. Ellis 
  Gregory W. Hislop 
  This poster discusses some efforts to develop student skills with current IT workflow tools and processes. These experiences have been introduced within the context of existing courses rather than trying to add an additional course to already crowded curricula.  

 Building an Impersonation Attack and Defense Testbed for Vehicle To Vehicle Systems   
 Mostafa El-Said 
  Xinli Wang 
  Samah Mansour 
  Andrew Kalafut 
  Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication takes place among a wide range of wireless nodes such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles. However, V2V systems are vulnerable to Global Positioning Systems (GPS) spoofing attacks, where a malicious vehicle may spoof a victim vehicle’s GPS coordinates to impersonate it. Thus, the malicious vehicle can act as a traffic injector imperiling traffic safety. In this work, we use simulation software as a platform to develop a practical testbed to execute an impersonation attack along with an in-vehicle defense technique.  

 The Super-Node Topology in Collaborative Learning   
 Loubna Mekouar 
  Muna Bader 
  Fatna Belqasmi 
  Incorporating new collaborative learning strategies will help increase students’ engagement and improve the learning experience. In this paper, we present a new method of group formation inspired by the super-node topology in peer-to-peer systems. This method proved to enhance students’ engagement, productivity, and cognitive skills in group-based assessments.  

 Designing Technology for Single Fathers using Human-Centered Design Approach   
 Andrew S. Burgdorf 
  Annu Sible Prabhakar 
  In this paper, we present a preliminary inquiry into the designing of support interventions for single fathers. We hope that a potential intervention would help them cope with the daily stressors of parenting. Currently, support solutions specifically designed for single fathers are scarce. This research uses the Human-centered design methodology to engaged single fathers in multiple research activities to gain insight into their support needs to inform potential designs for support interventions.

 Leveraging Bias Conscious Artificial Intelligence to Increase STEM Graduates Among Underrepresented Populations   
 Josette Riep 
  Annu Prabhakar 
  Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) remains one of the fastest-growing and one of the most segregated professions in the United States. Predominately white and male, opportunities in STEM continue to grow exponentially. Areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for example are expected to become $11 trillion industries by 2025. As employers struggle to find skilled candidates we face the reality that African Americans are too often left behind. African Americans make up less than 5% of the IT workforce and a small percentage of IT graduates. Although there is acknowledgment and some investment by both industry and educational institutions there has been minimal success in changing the demographic landscape. This study focuses on how AI can be used to better understand barriers, personalize student experiences and provide pathways of attainment for an increasingly diverse student body.  

 SESSION: Session 6: Workshop 2  
 Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Workshop   
 Kristina Kaldon 
  Robert Love 
  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is changing the way we work, by automating mundane and repetitive tasks. RPA leverages software robots to interact with web and desktop applications just like humans do, through the user interface. In this workshop, UiPath will provide an overview of RPA and industry use cases, as well as hands-on exercises and knowledge on how to teach RPA to students.  

 SESSION: Session 7: Keynote Talk 2  
 Getting Everyone the IT Education They Need   
 Mark Guzdial 
  The inventors of the term “computer science” meant for it to be something that was taught to everyone, to facilitate learning other subjects, and to help people understand the risks of technology in their lives. Alan Perlis (with Newell and Simon) published the first definition of “computer science” in Science in 1967 [6]. In 1961, he argued at MIT that everyone at the academia should learn to program, to give them a new way to understand their world [10]. At the same event, C.P. Snow (author of The Two Cultures [11]) argued that we should teach everyone about computing so that they would understand the dangers in our new computerized society [12]. He wrote: “A handful of people having no relation to the will of society, having no communication with the rest of society, will be taking decisions in secret which are going to affect our lives in the deepest sense.”  
 The world today relies on information technology but, we mostly teach IT to people who will become professionals. This leaves us with only a privileged class that understands a critical part of our world. If we want to reach the original and more general goal we will have to change how we teach about computing. With my students and collaborators I have been identifying the barriers to giving everyone an understanding of the computing technology in their world.We have explored how socioeconomic status influences success in computing [9], and how increasing access to high school computing courses has not led to a commensurate increase in the number or diversity fo students taking those courses [7, 8]. We have been studying why students reject computer science [1], and how to invent new forms of computing education that meet the needs of students who have not succeeded in traditional computing courses [2]. In our most recent work we ask questions like “What are fundamental ideas of computing that everyone needs to reason about and use the computational technologies in their world?” and “How can we re-design computation to make it more approachable, accessible, and adoptable?” [3-5]  

 SESSION: Session 8A: Jobs & Careers  
 Are you one of us?: How Employers Prioritize among IT Graduates   
 Per Lauvås 
  Kjetil Raaen 
  Anders Olof Larsson 
  When we are designing IT education and degree programs, knowledge about what graduates need to succeed is important. One source of such knowledge are employers. This paper presents a survey of Norwegian employers asking what they are looking for in a recently graduated IT candidate. We confirm that the so called soft skills are highly prized. Among these, we identify a less reported concept of fitting into company or team culture as the most important. Another somewhat unexpected result is that employers do not expect to see a portfolio from graduates. Among technologies mentioned, Java is at the top followed closely by C# and .NET. Python and JavaScript are also mentioned often. Our study suggests that soft skills should be a focus throughout IT education programs.  

 Retrieving and Classifying LinkedIn Job Titles for Alumni Career Analysis   
 Lei Li 
  Svetlana Peltsverger 
  Jack Zheng 
  Linh Le 
  Michael Handlin 
  It is important for universities to track alumni careers after graduation for both program quality improvement and accreditation requirements. The most common way of collecting such data is through alumni surveys, but historically these surveys had low response rates. LinkedIn, a social network site that targets working professionals provides a great platform for academic programs to connect with alumni and collect their career information. Current approaches for career analysis using LinkedIn data often require a labor-intensive manual process that is not scalable and sustainable. In this paper, we propose a system for the automated retrieval and classification of LinkedIn job titles for alumni career analysis. Our research prototype and experiment results show that the proposed system can effectively crawl LinkedIn profiles and classify job titles based on Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) job categories [1]. Our approach is the first of its kind in career analysis using LinkedIn and can be easily adopted by other universities or programs to develop career analysis systems for their alumni.  

 Transforming Education: Upskilling for a Cloudy Tomorrow   
 Elodie Billionniere 
  Lawrence Meyer 
  Cloud computing deployment and demand has increased year over year during the prior decade and has only accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid increase in cloud technology has also increased the need for higher education institutions to train students and re-skill or up-skill working professionals. This paper discusses the application of high impact training methodologies and their impact on student learning.

 Meaningful Course Evaluations   
 Heidi J. C. Ellis 
  Gregory W. Hislop 
  Cara Tang 
  Stephen Zilora 
  Evaluating courses and how well they are taught is an essential task for every educational institution. Evaluations support improvement of instruction and course content. They are also often an important input to annual reviews and tenure and promotion decisions. In spite of these important uses, many institutions do not feel that their course evaluations are meeting these needs as well as they would like. And faculty, students and administrators all seem to have some level of complaint and frustration related to evaluations. This panel will focus on course evaluation for computing degree programs. Panelists will identify problems and discuss helpful ideas for making course evaluations more useful.

 Modeling Computing Students’ Perceived Academic Performance in an Online Learning Environment   
 Rex Bringula 
  Ma. Ymelda Batalla 
  Ma. Teresa Borebor 
  This study attempted to develop a model that characterized the perceived academic performance of computing students (subsequently referred to as students) in an online learning environment. It was hypothesized that students’ academic performance in online learning could be modeled through their online learning capabilities, attitudes towards online learning, and online learning academic self-concept. Toward this goal, 264 students answered a validated survey form. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that perceived academic performance in terms of perceived grade attainment and perceived learning achievements had different sets of predictors. This finding indicates that perceived academic performance in an online learning environment has two distinct measures with distinct sets of predictors. Additional analyses revealed that the students are further distinguished when the predictors were categorized by levels of academic performance. Implications to online teaching and recommendations are discussed.  

 Misinformation and Disinformation in the Era of COVID-19: The Role of Primary Information Sources and the Development of Attitudes Toward Vaccination   
 Marc Dupuis 
  Kelly Chhor 
  Nhu Ly 
  Misinformation is not new; however, the proliferation of social media has resulted in a much broader reach and instantaneous impact. Results from such proliferation were seen during the 2016 and 2020 elections in the United States. The reach of false information in the context of a U.S. Presidential election would not be the pinnacle of the harm it can cause. In the current context, the spread of false information in the middle of a pandemic and related to causes, cures, and conspiracies, has the potential to do real harm, if it has not already. Now that vaccines are widely available in some countries, this harm may result in lives being lost that did not have to be. In this paper, we explore vaccination status in the context of information sources used by individuals. The results suggest that a lack of trust and engagement in traditional news outlets is associated with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccination initiation or completion. Higher levels of engagement with sources that have been used in the past to propagate conspiracy theories, such as YouTube, are also associated with lower levels of vaccination initiation or completion. Public health implications and the need for greater information literacy are discussed.  

 Dual Teaching: Simultaneous Remote and In-Person Learning During COVID   
 Hunter Williams 
  Malcolm Haynes 
  Joseph Kim 
  Social distancing guidelines put in place to combat COVID-19 resulted in a general education introductory information technology course being taught in a dual teaching environment. Each lesson, some students attended in-person while simultaneously others attended remotely. Students alternated each lesson between in-person and remote attendance. We examined whether there was any difference in performance between in-person and remote attendance using an end-of-lesson quiz. For some students the quiz was announced and for others it was unannounced. Additionally, we measured the subjective experience of students via a survey. We found that students attending class in-person performed better on end of class quizzes; the difference was small but statistically significant. In-person students also reported paying more attention, being more engaged, and understanding the lesson material better than remote students. Announcing the quiz did not statistically affect performance, although it did improve the subjective experience of in-person students. Finally, when it comes to dual teaching, both students and instructors prefer in-person or remote teaching. Nevertheless, dual teaching may be an effective approach; there was little difference in final course grades between in-person teaching and dual teaching.  

 SESSION: Session 9B: Programming  
 Enabling Peer-Led Coding Camps by Creating a Seed Effect in Young Students   
 Ilenia Fronza 
  Luis Corral 
  Gennaro Iaccarino 
  Claus Pahl 
  During peer-led intensive events (such as hackathons and coding camps), students actively assist others to learn and, in turn, benefit from an effective learning environment. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.  

 Assessing the Effectiveness of Teaching Programming Concepts through Online Interactive Outreach Workshops   
 Cindy Robertson 
  Anca Doloc-Mihu 
  In this study, we present our findings with regard to the effectiveness of teaching computing concepts online via interactive outreach projects. These outreach activities were facilitated through our service-based learning course, the Technology Ambassador Program (TAP). The goal is to determine how effective these online outreach activities are and how we can improve upon them. The results of this study show that online outreach activities can be effective using already known teaching strategies such as repetition and hands-on activities. Surprisingly, we also found that these strategies work whether the participants are STEM or non-STEM students. Another important finding was the limitation of self-reported knowledge of understanding compared to the objectively assessed ability to implement the knowledge.  

 Undergraduate Research Experience with Software Development using a Large Existing Code Base in a Teaching-oriented College

  Ikechukwu Okolocha 
  Undergraduate research has been shown to enrich education, increase retention and promote critical thinking. Research projects involving extending an already mature and relatively large code base have special value for students, as they mimic industry experience. Students have to understand the existing code structure and figure out where to add their code to extend the functionality of the system. There are obvious challenges for undergraduate students to take on such projects, including lack of knowledge at the onset of the project, limited time span (normally a semester), and limited time availability during a semester. Undergraduate institutions have additional challenges, such as high teaching load for faculty advisors and lack of graduate students who could act as mentors. In this paper, we report our experience with a relatively large project that lasted for several semesters and involved several teams of students. We managed the challenges by being flexible and carving out many mini-projects from this umbrella project, which required that the faculty advisor work closely with students. The project has successfully produced a teaching/learning tool for auto-gradable full tracing exercises. The tool has been prototyped in classrooms and helped students learn various programming constructs. We hope that our experience could encourage larger scale projects in undergraduate institutions.  

 SESSION: Session 10A: Teaching Techniques & Ideas  
 Applying Aviation Training Techniques in the IT Classroom   
 Stephen J. Zilora 
  Aviation training is a rigorous process requiring the student pilot to learn the theoretical underpinnings of multiple subjects, risk management and decision making under stress and, of course, the skills necessary to fly a plane. The educational process is rooted in learning theory, but it utilizes several approaches more fully than in typical academic classrooms resulting in a significantly greater level of engagement. This paper documents the results of a pilot study to apply three of these approaches in an information technology programming course-the Master/Apprentice approach, a focus on task mastery vs. time on task, and shared responsibility for achieving goals. While these three approaches were implemented to a limited degree during the pilot, the successful results suggest a more complete implementation of these approaches which is also outlined in this paper.  

 Investigating the Role of Different Prep Pathways on CS2 Performance Across Three Different Majors   
 Farzana Rahman 
  Jaya Tyagi 
  Research have shown that introductory programming sequence have a significant impact in the retention of students in computing and engineering majors. There has been extensive research about the CS1 course [1]. Much less has been written about the CS1.5 and CS2 course, which are often gateway courses for computing and engineering majors. CS2 classes often reflect a second semester course in programming, yet when studying this course many universities have different purposes for this course. Currently there is a wide range of variation in CS courses. Some of these are used to expose students to a wider range of languages; in other cases, a new language is used to introduce concepts such as object-oriented programming, instead of the language used in CS1. However, even though CS2 is one of the fundamental courses in computing or CS major curriculum, the impacts of the different prep pathways leading to CS2 course is not well studied [2, 3]. Due to the critical nature of the CS2 course and its importance in CS major curriculum, in many institutions, CS2 or data structure course is recognized as an attrition point for CS Majors [4]. Understanding the impacts of the different prep pathways in CS2 course performance and the CS2 curriculum itself could give insights into the attrition behaviors. This paper presents a study which is conducted to understand the impact how student performance in CS2 course gets impacted by different programming languages used in CS1.5 course.  

 Tadawl: An Educational Platform for Gamifying Startup Investment   
 Hend S. Al-Khalifa 
  Rawan Al-Matham 
  Gamification, or the use of game mechanics in non-game applications, allows students to learn by doing. In this paper we present our experience in implementing a gamification platform in our entrepreneurship course to encourage students on investing in their peers’ projects and provide them with feedback. The platform involved the interaction of 106 undergraduate female students during a semester long entrepreneurship course. We also report the results obtained after using the platform in terms of students’ feedback and final remarks.

 We Did It! So Can You! Creating “No-Textbook” IT Degrees   
 Rebecca Rutherfoord 
  Lei Li 
  Hossain Shahriar 
  James Rutherfoord 
  One of the largest expenses for university students is the cost of textbooks. This is particularly true in the STEM areas. Data shows that course textbooks cost more and more every year. Textbook costs have risen 812% since 1978 and 73% since 2006 – which is four times the rate of inflation. The College Board recommends that students budget at least $1200 per year for textbook costs. Over 1/3 of students use their financial aid for textbook costs. The average computer science/IT textbook costs $180. In order to help alleviate some of these textbook costs, the State of Georgia has been offering to faculty Affordable Learning Grants across all majors. Several faculty in the Information Technology Department of Kennesaw State University were awarded an ALG grant during the Summer-Fall 2018 for redevelopment of four undergraduate IT courses using no textbook. In the past three years several IT faculty members have been awarded these ALG grants for redevelopment of information security courses, database courses, and an ethics course. The results of the redevelopment of the database courses and information security courses have been very positive for the students. The panel will discuss the current re-development of IT courses, and report on the positive results of prior re-development of no-textbook courses.  

 SESSION: Session 6: Workshop 3  
 Design Thinking For Technology Design   
 Annu Sible Prabhakar 
  This paper describes the workshop titled “Design Thinking For Technology Design.” Design thinking is a collaborative design process that keeps the user’s needs at the center. This workshop will introduce design thinking methodology to the participants through hands-on activities. The workshop participants will work on a problem and design a low fidelity prototype of a potential solution. This workshop is open to everyone.

  Deadlines are hard and at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).  
 Papers may be submitted to any deadline and, upon acceptance, papers will be scheduled for publication in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems  (POMACS) and presentation at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft Tracking | : SIGMETRICS uses "soft" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high-performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks,cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site. 
  The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of the claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to "opt out" of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to "opt out", an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS, and submit the paper with an authors' response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution.

If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers.

  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers).

  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 In Brief  
 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 48th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as an in-person conference from July 13th to 18th, 2025 in Padua, Italy. For the full paper call, we welcome high-impact original papers with contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. Please note CFPs for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2025 venues will be released separately.  
 Important Dates for Full Papers  
 Deadlines time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  
 Full paper abstracts due: January 16, 2025 
  Full papers due: January 23, 2025 
  Full paper notifications: March 28, 2025 
   
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 16, 2025 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 23, 2025 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from other conferences should submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts ("placeholder abstracts").  
 Submission Guidelines  
 See this brief checklist  to strengthen an IR paper, for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2025).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length  (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references), with unrestricted space for references  , in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf  templates are available from the ACM Website  (use sigconf  proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.  
 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}   
 Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025   
 by selecting the “SIGIR 2025 Full Papers”  track.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for SIGIR 2025, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person  .  
 Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit, to SIGIR 2025, papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to the SIGIR 2025 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy  . Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 In-Person Attendance Policy  
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.  
 All accepted papers (including all tracks) to the main conference and workshops are expected to be presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper will attend the conference in person to deliver the paper and address audience questions during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted. More information at the SIGIR 2025 In-presence Policy  page.  
 Child Care Service  
 SIGIR 2025 promotes inclusion and attendance also by organizing a child care service, in order to foster work-family balance by offering congress attendees the opportunity to attend events with their children.  
 Children from 0 to 12 years of age are welcomed in a specially set up room inside Padua Congress Center throughout the duration of the congress. A colorful, “warm”, safe and welcoming environment, in the same structure that hosts the congresses, a protected place where parents can leave their children, but at the same time stay in touch with them during the breaks of the different sessions.  
 The nursery space dedicated to the 0-3 age group, equipped with a changing table and other facilities dedicated to the little ones, is next to the kids’ area for children over 3 years old and a cinema room for screenings.  
 The activities are run by a company specialized in education services with expert staff, appointed by Padua Congress Center, and include thematic workshops - from painting to creative activities - as well as playtime also in the open air, in the facility's outdoor spaces. Children are also offered lunch.  
 The service is available - for a fee (depending on sponsors) - to all SIGIR 2025 attendees who request it. For more information and updates, check out the SIGIR 2025 Child Care  page.  
 Authorship Policy  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy  before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship, under any circumstances, will be permitted after the abstract submission deadline or for the camera-ready submission. So please, make sure you have listed authors correctly at abstract submission time.  
 Use of AI  
 All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence  .  
 Desk Rejection Policy  
 Submissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy  , length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty  , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
  Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or links to extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | submit source code for artifact review | . If you need to shared anonymous code, you may use anonymous git repositories, such as | https://anonymous.4open.science/ | . 
  Change of authors after the abstract submission deadline. 
  Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
  Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty.

 Call for Papers  
 Overview  
 The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13 2025.   
 We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation. The research may target systems in a broad range of domains, including networking, high-performance computing, machine learning, IoT, cloud, edge, multimedia, mobile, and cyber-physical systems. The work may target diverse system metrics such as latency, throughput, reliability, cost, accuracy, fairness, energy, and carbon footprint.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Awards and the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).

 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft Tracking | : SIGMETRICS uses "soft" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high-performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks,cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site. 
  The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of the claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to "opt out" of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to "opt out", an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS, and submit the paper with an authors' response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.

 2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS @Berlin, Germany  

 Welcome  
 Welcome to the home of the 2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference  , to be held in Berlin, Germany, on June 22 - 27, 2025.  
 The Conference.  The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.  
 The Berlin Area.  Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is located in the heart of Europe. With 50 lakes, three rivers (Havel, Spree, and Dahme), and eight canals, Berlin is a water city with around 1,000 bridges, significantly more than Venice. The federal capital has about 3.9 million inhabitants and is Germany's number one cultural melting pot. People from all over the world have shaped the city. Nowhere else in Germany can you find so many world-famous sights, events, flair, charm, entertainment options, a vibrant nightlife, a vast shopping world, and boundless culinary diversity.  
 The Conference Hotel.  The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard façade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous "Tiergarten" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis. It is one of Germany's leading conference and event venues, providing an outstanding stage for events of all kinds. It was honored with the "Europe's Leading Conference Hotel" award at the World Travel Awards 2024.  

  SIGMOD/PODS 2025 Anti-Harassment Policy  
 SIGMOD 2025 adheres to the ACM Policy Against Harassment.  Any participant who experiences unacceptable behavior may contact any current member of the SIGMOD Executive Committee  and the PODS Executive Committee  or DBCares  . Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.

 Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues  
 The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment  . Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.  
 For more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/   
 Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.  
 Inclusion  
 Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:  
  
 Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:   
 Implicit assumption: | An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents. 
  Oppressive terminology: | Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in | this article | . 
  Marginalization of URGs: | An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities. 
  Lack of accessibility: | Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple 
  Stereotyping: | Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles. 
   
 Diversity  
 Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.  
 Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:   
 Embracing different cultures: | Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., | this article | on names across different cultures. 
  Embracing differences in figures: | Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people. 
  Embracing gender diversity in pronouns: | Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles. 
   
 Responsibility  
 Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article  discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article  also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.
