 Call for Research Track Papers  

 Research Track  
 Effective Jan 1 2024, the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) has a new policy. See this page  to learn about its implications on CODS-COMAD authors.  
   
 We invite the submission of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in the areas of data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation and results of solutions of such advances to real-world problems. Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking. We invite two types of submissions:  
 Full papers: 8 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  Short papers: 4 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  The goal of the short papers is to provide a venue for innovative ideas such as engineered solutions, exciting work-in-progress or even negative results that would be interesting to the broader community. The review process will take place in two stages.  
 In the first stage of the review, papers will be grouped as Accept, Major Revision or Reject. 
  In the second stage of the review, authors can revise and resubmit Major Revision papers. They will then be regrouped as Accept or Reject. 
  Authors of accepted full papers must present their work as both a talk and a poster at the conference; accepted short papers must present their work as a poster. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 AI, ML, and Data Mining: | Classification and regression; Knowledge discovery; knowledge representation and knowledge-based systems; data preprocessing and wrangling; feature engineering; reinforcement learning; deep learning; Bayesian methods; time series analysis; optimization; graphical models; statistical relational learning; matrix and tensor methods; parallel and distributed learning; semi- and unsupervised learning; graph mining; network analytics; text analytics and NLP; information retrieval; learning-based computer vision; multimodal learning and analytics; human-in-the-loop learning; planning and reasoning; ML for mobiles and other resource-constrained environments; federated learning; AutoML; causality; weak supervision and data augmentation; new benchmark tasks and datasets for AI/ML/data mining. 
  Data Management: | Data management systems (subtopics including but not limited to benchmarking, monitoring, testing, and tuning database systems, cloud, distributed, decentralized and parallel data management, database systems on emerging hardware, embedded databases, IoT and Sensor networks, Storage, indexing, and physical database design, Query processing and optimization, Transaction processing, Data warehousing, OLAP, Analytics); Models and Languages (subtopics including but not limited to Data models and semantics, Declarative programming languages and optimization, Spatial and temporal data management, Graphs, social networks, web data, and semantic web, Multimedia and information retrieval, Uncertain, probabilistic, and approximate databases, Streams and complex event processing); Human-Centric Data Management (subtopics including but not limited to Data exploration, visualization, query languages, and user interfaces, Crowdsourced and collaborative data management, User-centric and human-in-the-loop data management, Natural language processing for databases); Data Governance (subtopics including but not limited to Data provenance and workflows, Data integration, information extraction, and schema matching, Data quality, data cleaning, Data security, privacy, and access control, Responsible data management and data fairness, Metadata Management). 
  Intersection of AI & Data Management: | Structured queries over unstructured data: images, video, natural language, natural language queries; machine learning methods for database engine internals; machine learning methods for database tuning; data management and metadata for machine learning pipelines; knowledge base management. 
  Data Science Ethics: | Subtopics including, but not limited to quantifying and mitigating fairness and bias issues; improving model trust, transparency and explainability; data privacy; model alignment; environmental costs; governance and regulation. 
  Sharing and Reproducibility  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative). Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.  
 Please read the Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest policies  before finalising your submission.  
 Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. Please see the Awards page  for details.  
 Partial travel Grants will be available for students (both domestic and international) whose papers are accepted.  
 Double Anonymity Requirement  
 CODS-COMAD 2025 will be using double-anonymous reviewing for Research Track papers (but not the ADS Track papers). Please review the instructions below carefully.  
 Authors’ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or anywhere else in the submission. Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. The file names of any documents submitted must not identify the authors of the submission. Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors’ names in the submission’s associated metadata. Only after acceptance at the camera-ready stage should the author list, acknowledgments, and funding sources be added to the paper.  
 To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to CODS-COMAD.  
 Be careful when referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. Authors must refer to their own past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity. Do not omit referring to your own past related work because that could reveal your identity by negation. Limit self-references to only the essential ones. Extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced. Many ACM conferences have successfully followed double anonymity for decades to offer more equity for all authors in the reviewing process. Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving double anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. It is the responsibility of the authors to do their very best to preserve double anonymity.  
 Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to Desk Rejection.

 We invite submissions describing the design, implementation and results of solutions for application of data science techniques to real-world problems. We invite two types of submissions:  
 Full papers: 8 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  Short papers: 4 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  The goal of the short papers is to provide a venue for innovative ideas such as engineered solutions, exciting work-in-progress or even negative results that would be interesting to the broader community. The review process will take place in two stages.  
 In the first stage of the review, papers will be grouped as Accept, Major Revision or Reject. 
  In the second stage of the review, authors can revise and resubmit Major Revision papers. They will then be regrouped as Accept or Reject. 
  Authors of accepted full papers must present their work as both a talk and a poster at the conference; accepted short papers must present their work as a poster. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Data Science and Data Management Applications: | Novel combination of data science and data management applications in domains such as education; software engineering; cloud computing; robotics and autonomous systems; security; agriculture; transportation; energy; real estate; manufacturing; finance; retail; healthcare; e-commerce; digital marketing; telecommunications; social network analysis; social computing; crowdsourcing; computational advertising; recommender systems; public policy; bio-chemical engineering; pollution tracking and climate change; material science; AI for natural sciences; bioinformatics; technology for emerging markets, etc. 
  Deployments and Lessons Learned: | Deployed experience papers from industry, government agencies, startups and NGOs relating to the large-scale deployment of data science applications and operations (MLOps, DLOps). Subtopics include infrastructure for scale, ease of adoption, and new data science/management technologies. Papers should highlight pain points and new challenges emerging due to deployment of these new technologies. Verifiable evidence of business impact, social impact, or other real-world impact from such deployments are encouraged. 
  Ethical issues in data science applications: | Fairness and bias; trust, transparency and explainability; data privacy; model alignment; environmental costs; policy, governance and regulation, especially when these issues are considered in relation to deployed systems. 
  Sharing and Reproducibility  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative). Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.  
 Please read the Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest policies  before finalising your submission.  
 Additionally, please see this page  to help you decide between the Research Track and Applied Data Science Track.  
 Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. Please see the Awards page  for details.  
 Partial travel Grants will be available for students (both domestic and international) whose papers are accepted.

 ACM Case Studies   
 Written by leading domain experts for software engineers, ACM Case Studies provide an in-depth look at how software teams overcome specific challenges by implementing new technologies, adopting new practices, or a combination of both. Often through first-hand accounts, these pieces explore what the challenges were, the tools and techniques that were used to combat them, and the solution that was achieved.

 Call for Participation in Data Challenges  

 CODS-COMAD Data Challenge is a pre-conference competition. The challenge aims to attract teams from the Data Science, Data mining, and Machine Learning community to participate. We expect students, practitioners, and researchers to form teams and participate in the competition.  
 This year we have an exciting data challenge for participation:   
  Data Challenge : Predict Key Attributes from Product Images  
 Have you ever encountered a product listing on an e-commerce platform where the image showed a short-sleeve shirt, but the description claimed it was long-sleeved? Such discrepancies are not just frustrating for customers—they're a significant challenge for e-commerce platforms striving to maintain accurate product catalogs at scale.  
 Meesho is sponsoring the data challenge that addresses this critical issue in the e-commerce industry. Participants will develop models to automatically predict key product attributes from images, revolutionizing how products are cataloged and listed online.  
 More details about the challenge, participation, and prizes can be found in Attribute Prediction

 Call for Research Track Papers  

 Research Track  
 Effective Jan 1 2024, the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) has a new policy. See this page  to learn about its implications on CODS-COMAD authors.  
   
 We invite the submission of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in the areas of data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation and results of solutions of such advances to real-world problems. Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking. We invite two types of submissions:  
 Full papers: 8 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  Short papers: 4 pages + (unlimited) references. 
  The goal of the short papers is to provide a venue for innovative ideas such as engineered solutions, exciting work-in-progress or even negative results that would be interesting to the broader community. The review process will take place in two stages.  
 In the first stage of the review, papers will be grouped as Accept, Major Revision or Reject. 
  In the second stage of the review, authors can revise and resubmit Major Revision papers. They will then be regrouped as Accept or Reject. 
  Authors of accepted full papers must present their work as both a talk and a poster at the conference; accepted short papers must present their work as a poster. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 AI, ML, and Data Mining: | Classification and regression; Knowledge discovery; knowledge representation and knowledge-based systems; data preprocessing and wrangling; feature engineering; reinforcement learning; deep learning; Bayesian methods; time series analysis; optimization; graphical models; statistical relational learning; matrix and tensor methods; parallel and distributed learning; semi- and unsupervised learning; graph mining; network analytics; text analytics and NLP; information retrieval; learning-based computer vision; multimodal learning and analytics; human-in-the-loop learning; planning and reasoning; ML for mobiles and other resource-constrained environments; federated learning; AutoML; causality; weak supervision and data augmentation; new benchmark tasks and datasets for AI/ML/data mining. 
  Data Management: | Data management systems (subtopics including but not limited to benchmarking, monitoring, testing, and tuning database systems, cloud, distributed, decentralized and parallel data management, database systems on emerging hardware, embedded databases, IoT and Sensor networks, Storage, indexing, and physical database design, Query processing and optimization, Transaction processing, Data warehousing, OLAP, Analytics); Models and Languages (subtopics including but not limited to Data models and semantics, Declarative programming languages and optimization, Spatial and temporal data management, Graphs, social networks, web data, and semantic web, Multimedia and information retrieval, Uncertain, probabilistic, and approximate databases, Streams and complex event processing); Human-Centric Data Management (subtopics including but not limited to Data exploration, visualization, query languages, and user interfaces, Crowdsourced and collaborative data management, User-centric and human-in-the-loop data management, Natural language processing for databases); Data Governance (subtopics including but not limited to Data provenance and workflows, Data integration, information extraction, and schema matching, Data quality, data cleaning, Data security, privacy, and access control, Responsible data management and data fairness, Metadata Management).

  Data Science Ethics: | Subtopics including, but not limited to quantifying and mitigating fairness and bias issues; improving model trust, transparency and explainability; data privacy; model alignment; environmental costs; governance and regulation. 
  Sharing and Reproducibility  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative). Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.  
 Please read the Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest policies  before finalising your submission.  
 Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. Please see the Awards page  for details.  
 Partial travel Grants will be available for students (both domestic and international) whose papers are accepted.  
 Double Anonymity Requirement  
 CODS-COMAD 2025 will be using double-anonymous reviewing for Research Track papers (but not the ADS Track papers). Please review the instructions below carefully.  
 Authors’ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or anywhere else in the submission. Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. The file names of any documents submitted must not identify the authors of the submission. Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors’ names in the submission’s associated metadata. Only after acceptance at the camera-ready stage should the author list, acknowledgments, and funding sources be added to the paper.  
 To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to CODS-COMAD.  
 Be careful when referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. Authors must refer to their own past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity. Do not omit referring to your own past related work because that could reveal your identity by negation. Limit self-references to only the essential ones. Extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced. Many ACM conferences have successfully followed double anonymity for decades to offer more equity for all authors in the reviewing process. Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving double anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. It is the responsibility of the authors to do their very best to preserve double anonymity.  
 Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to Desk Rejection.

  Call For Papers   
   
 The Proceedings of the ACM on Networking (PAMCNET) journal is seeking papers containing significant and novel research results on emerging computer networks and its applications. All accepted long papers will also be presented in the ACM CoNEXT 2024 conference. This is a new model that strives to combine the benefits of both conference and journal based publication. We especially encourage submissions that present novel experimentation, creative use of networking technologies, and new insights made possible using analysis. We invite submissions on a wide range of networking topics. The list of topics includes (in alphabetical order): Content distribution and caching, e.g., CDN, peer-to-peer, overlays Design, analysis, and evaluation of network architectures Energy-efficient computing and networking Experience and lessons learned by deploying large-scale networked systems In-network computing, NFV and network programmability Innovative uses of network data beyond communication Network measurements and modeling Internet economics and policy Mobile and wireless network protocols and applications Machine learning as applied to all layers of networking Networked applications including web, video, and online social networks Network aspects of datacenters, cloud computing, operating systems, virtualization Network aspects of IoT Network control and management, including SDN Network, transport, and application-layer protocols Reliability and availability of networks, protocols, and applications Reproducibility of networking research Routing and traffic engineering Security and privacy aspects of network applications and protocols We are open to other contributions that stretch networking research outside of these topics, present new emerging computing trends, or potentially involve unfamiliar techniques. We emphasize that the focus of CoNEXT is networking and its impact on networked applications. For example, papers focusing on the wireless physical layer without considering the impact on the network (e.g., quantitative performance benefits, deployment challenges) are out of scope. Potential authors who are unsure of the scope are encouraged to contact the PC chairs before submission. The CoNEXT conference will present all papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Networking (PAMCNET), as well as short papers submitted to the conference. There are two deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below).  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-03-14

 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.

 Call for Papers  
 SIGNLL invites submissions to the 28th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2024). The focus of CoNLL is on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics, rather than on work driven by particular engineering applications  . Such approaches include:  
 Computational learning theory and other techniques for theoretical analysis of machine learning models for NLP 
  Models of first, second and bilingual language acquisition by humans 
  Models of sign language acquisition, understanding, and production 
  Models of language evolution and change 
  Computational simulation and analysis of findings from psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic experiments 
  Analysis and interpretation of NLP models, using methods inspired by cognitive science or linguistics or other methods 
  Data resources, techniques and tools for scientifically-oriented research in computational linguistics 
  Connections between computational models and formal languages or linguistic theories 
  Linguistic typology, translation, and other multilingual work 
  Theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to text generation 
  We welcome work targeting any aspect of language, including:  
 Speech and phonology 
  Syntax and morphology 
  Lexical, compositional and discourse semantics 
  Dialogue and interactive language use 
  Sociolinguistics 
  Multimodal and grounded language learning 
  We do not restrict the topic of submissions to fall into this list. However, the submissions’ relevance to the conference’s focus on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches  will play an important role in the review process.  
 Submitted papers must be anonymous  and use the EMNLP 2024 template  . Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages  of content plus unlimited space for references. Authors of accepted papers will have an additional page to address reviewers’ comments in the camera-ready version (9 pages of content in total, excluding references). Optional anonymized supplementary materials and a PDF appendix  are allowed.

  Invited speakers  
   
 Thamar Solorio  (Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, MBZUAI)  
 Title:  Towards AI models that can help us to become better global social beings  
 Abstract:  Cultural norms and values fundamentally shape our social interactions. Communication within any society reflects these cultural contexts. For example, while direct eye contact is often seen as a sign of confidence in many Western cultures, it may be viewed as disrespectful in other parts of the world. Moreover, human-human interactions include so much more than just the words we utter; nonverbal communication, including body language and other cues, provides rich signals to those around us.   
 As vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into user-facing applications, it is becoming relevant to wonder if and to what extent this technology can robustly process these signals. My research group is interested in developing evaluation frameworks to assess the abilities of VLMs concerning interpreting social cues and in developing new approaches that can assist us and, perhaps, enhance our cross-cultural human-human interactions.   
  
 Bio:  Thamar Solorio is a professor in the NLP department at MBZUAI. She is also a tenured professor of Computer Science at the University of Houston. She is the director and founder of the RiTUAL Lab. Her research interests include NLP for low-resource settings and multilingual data, including code-switching and information extraction. More recently, she was moved towards language and vision problems, focusing on developing inclusive NLP. She received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award for her work on authorship attribution and was awarded the 2014 Emerging Leader ABIE Award in Honor of Denice Denton. She served two terms as an elected board member of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics (NAACL) and was PC co-chair for NAACL 2019. She is an Editor in Chief for the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) initiative and was a member of the advisory board for ARR. She serves as general chair for the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.   

  Lorna Quandt  (Gallaudet University)  
 Title:  Integrating AI-Driven Sign Language Technologies in Education: Recognition, Generation, and Interaction  
 Abstract:  This talk explores integrating AI-driven technologies in sign language research, covering the unique challenges of sign language recognition and generation. Dr. Quandt will explore these cutting-edge considerations through the lens of two research projects, ASL Champ! and BRIDGE. Both projects focus on sign language recognition and generation, which is crucial for advancing interaction in virtual and educational environments. ASL Champ! utilizes a dataset of 3D signs to enhance deep-learning-powered sign recognition in virtual reality. At the same time, BRIDGE extends this work by incorporating both recognition and generation of signs to create a more robust, interactive experience. This dual focus underscores the importance of pursuing recognition and generation in tandem rather than treating them as entirely distinct challenges. By leveraging advances in AI and natural language processing (NLP), we can create technologies that recognize and generate signs and facilitate deeper understanding and use of signed languages. These advancements hold great educational potential, particularly in providing more accessible tools for deaf students and enabling broader instruction in sign language. The talk will also address how these innovations can reshape the NLP field by widening the focus beyond spoken/written language and into multimodal, signed, and nonverbal aspects of language, which can inform all linguistic research.  
 Bio:  Dr. Lorna Quandt is the Action & Brain Lab director at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. She serves as Co-Director of the VL2 Research Center alongside Melissa Malzkuhn. Dr. Quandt is an Associate Professor in the Ph.D. in Educational Neuroscience (PEN) program and the Science Director of the Motion Light Lab. Dr. Quandt founded the Action & Brain lab in early 2016. Before that, Dr. Quandt obtained her BA in Psychology from Haverford College and a PhD in Psychology, specializing in Brain & Cognitive Sciences, from Temple University. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Dr. Anjan Chatterjee. Her research examines how knowledge of sign language changes perception, particularly visuospatial processing. Dr. Quandt is also pursuing the development of research-based educational technology to create new ways to learn signed languages in virtual reality.

 COPLAS. Constraint Satisfaction Techniques for Planning and Scheduling Problems  
 The areas of AI planning and scheduling have seen important advances thanks to the application of constraint satisfaction models and techniques. Solutions to many real-world problems need to integrate plan synthesis capabilities with resource allocation, which can be efficiently managed by using constraint satisfaction techniques.  
 The workshop will aim at providing a forum for researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence to discuss novel issues on planning, scheduling constraint programming/constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and many other common areas that exist among them. On the whole, the workshop will mainly focus on managing complex problems where planning, scheduling and constraint satisfaction must be combined and/or interrelated, which entails an enormous potential for practical applications and future research.  
 This workshop continues the trail of the successful COPLAS since 2006. During two years, the workshop was a joint workshop for both ICAPS and CP which provided a broader audience and gave the participants of both events the opportunity to exchange ideas and approaches that lead to a valuable and fruitful discussion, and inspired forthcoming research.  
 COPLAS is ranked as CORE B  in ERA Conference Ranking.  
 Proceedings  
 The COPLAS proceedings  are available as pdf  .  
 Schedule  
 This schedule as a PDF file.   
 The workshop will be held on June 13, 2011  in hall 101–00–010/014  on the computer science campus.

 constraint modelling for planning & scheduling 
  reformulations of constraint models for P&S 
  global constraints motivated by P&S 
  temporal CSPs 
  integration of temporal and resource reasoning via CSPs 
  search techniques and heuristics 
  distributed/parallel solving techniques 
  constraint management in P&S systems 
  real-life applications 
  Papers must be prepared according to the AAAI style template  ( http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php  ) and should be no more than eight pages, including figures and bibliography. Submissions will be handled via EasyChair at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coplas11  . Every submitted paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop notes.  
 A journal special issue is under consideration for best papers of COPLAS'11.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission deadline: | March 25, 2011 
  Notification: | April 15, 2011 
  Workshop dates: | June 13th, 2011 
  Workshop Format  
 The workshop will be organized in technical sessions; each session will be concluded by a commentary of the session chair. The goal of the commentary is not only to summarize the content of talks but to highlight important novel points and raise questions to foster further discussion. We also plan to have individual commentary of each paper done by other authors in the session. Rather than being a mini-conference, the workshop will focus on opening new research areas and topics, discussing possible solutions, exchanging ideas and approaches, and in general inspiring forthcoming research.

 Research Workshop of the Israel Science Foundation  

  COPLAS. Constraint Satisfaction Techniques for Planning and Scheduling Problems  
 The workshop aims at providing a forum to discuss novel issues on planning, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction problems. Solutions to many real-world problems need to integrate plan synthesis capabilities with time and resource allocation, which can be efficiently managed by constraint satisfaction and OR techniques. Formulations of P&S problems as CSPs, resource and temporal global constraints, and inference techniques are of particular interest of COPLAS.  
 Objectives and Topics  
 The areas of AI planning and scheduling have seen important advances thanks to the application of constraint satisfaction models and techniques. Especially solutions to many real-world problems need to integrate plan synthesis capabilities with resource allocation, which can be efficiently managed by using constraint satisfaction techniques. The workshop will aim at providing a forum for researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence to discuss novel issues on planning, scheduling, constraint programming/constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and many other common areas that exist among them. On the whole, the workshop will mainly focus on managing complex problems where planning, scheduling and constraint satisfaction must be combined and/or interrelated, which entails an enormous potential for practical applications and future research. COPLAS is ranked as CORE B in ERA Conference Ranking and it is covered in selected Elsevier database products.

 About CoopIS  
 Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) facilitate the cooperation between individuals, organisations, smart devices, and systems of systems, by providing flexible, scalable and intelligent services to enterprises, public institutions and user communities. As a result, people and smart devices can interact, share information and work together across physical barriers. The domain of CIS integrates research results from different related computing areas, such as: distributed systems, coordination technologies, collaborative decision making, enterprise architecture, business process management and conceptual modelling.  
   
  In recent years, several innovative technologies have emerged: Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Computing, the Internet of Things, Linked Open Data, Semantic Systems, Collective Awareness Platforms, Block Chain, Processes as a Service, etc, that enable the next generation of CISs.  
   
  In developing the next generation CISs, research is needed towards (1) the applicability and use of the above mentioned innovative technologies, (2) approaches to develop CISs in particular catering towards the multitude of stakeholders involved in the development of socio-cyber-physical systems, and (3) associated modelling techniques to express and analyse the different aspects of these systems in cohesion.  
   
  The CoopIS conference series is an established international event for presenting and discussing scientific contributions about technical, economical, and societal aspects of distributed information systems at scale.  

 Upcoming Edition  
 CoopIS 2025  will take place in Marbella, Spain (20-22 October 2025). This 31th edition  is organized by INSTICC  . More information can be found at https://coopis.scitevents.org/   

 CoopIS Conferences  
 The CoopIS conference series began in 1993 as the International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems and was renamed the International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems in 1994. The first edition in 1993 was created by Prof. Robert Meersman (VUB, Belgium). From 2002 to 2019, CoopIS was part of a federated conference, held jointly with the International Symposium on Distributed Objects and Applications (DOA) and the International Conference on Ontologies, Databases, and Applications of Semantics (ODBASE) for large-scale information systems. After a hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic, CoopIS resumed in 2022. Since 2000, CoopIS proceedings have been published by Springer Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 The conference began in Rotterdam and subsequently traveled to various locations, including Catania, Sicily in 2003; Cyprus in 2004 and 2005; Montpellier in 2006; Vilamoura in 2007 and 2009; Monterrey, Mexico in 2008; Heraklion, Crete in 2010 and 2011; Rome in 2012; Graz in 2013; Amantea, Italy in 2014; Rhodes in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019; Valletta in 2018; Bozen-Bolzano in 2022; Groningen in 2023; Porto in 2024; and Marbella in 2025.

  Furelos-Blanco D, Jonsson A, Palacios H, Jiménez S. Forward-Search Temporal Planning with Simultaneous Events. ICASP’18 Workshop on Constraint Satisfaction Techniques for Planning and Scheduling Problems (COPLAS 2018)  
 In this paper we describe STP, a novel algorithm for temporal planning. Similar to several existing temporal planners, STP relies on a transformation from temporal planning to classical planning, and constructs a temporal plan by finding a sequence of classical actions that solve the problem while satisfying a given set of temporal constraints. Our main contribution is that STP can solve temporal planning problems that require simultaneous events, i.e. the temporal actions have to be scheduled in such a way that two or more of their effects take place concurrently. To do so, STP separates each event into three phases: one phase in which temporal actions are scheduled to end, one phase in which simultaneous effects take place, and one phase in which temporal actions are scheduled to start.

   Multi Agent and Autonomous Systems Architectures  
  
 UAVs, UUVs, UGVs, planetary rovers and space probes operate with limited human intervention in changing and partially known environment. These autonomous systems navigate and manage internal behavior while responding to mission updates, threats, failures and situation awareness. They can also sense, decide and act in a collaborative way. Therefore, their operational performances strongly depend on the ability of the system to anticipate, adapt and react. In particular, different form of on-line planning and scheduling appear to be critical for the success of challenging missions. Various theoretical and practical aspects of planning and scheduling are nowadays resolved with many symbolic, logic and numerical techniques, but a broad range of problems are still open to operate autonomous systems in an intelligent and integrated way.

   Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling  
  
 Planning is a critical phase in preparing challenging missions, in particular for first responders in disaster relief, space and defence operations. Mission constraints deeply impacts both plan elaboration, resource allocation and task scheduling processes performed by the different entities. A serie of constraint-based methods for AI planning and scheduling techniques is presented. The proposed approach can tackle complex model-based constraint formulations, including coordinations and synchronisations. The work explore different hybrid search techniques, based on exact methods, reinforced with metaheuristics and machine learning approaches, opening new ways to combine numerical and symbolic computation. Another approach is to prepare critical missions using serious gaming, which also makes use of AI planning and scheduling techniques.

   Network Centric Interactive Systems  
  
 Due to the massive introduction of networking digital systems and devices, information flows are constantly expanding. Requirements capture, quality and guarantee of services, and systems design are difficult to formalise at a same pace. Moreover, it is hard to keep human in the loop and new types of interactions need to be explored. Concept Development and Experimentation (CD&E) lifecycle (such as Phoenix in the defense area) explores new network centric capabilities using rapid system prototyping.

   Solving Real-time, Parallel and Distributed Problems  
  
 In modern architectures, the increasing number of processing units associated to various levels of resources (memory levels, bus) have made system design both difficult and costly. Mapping statically the set of tasks onto a multi-processor system is one of the most crucial issues, since the designer must guarantee system both feasibility and performances. These papers show how to use constraint solving and optimisation techniques to efficiently map high performance and real-time applications on parallel and distributed architectures. Recently GPU architectures has provided a wide access to parallel computation. Optimising compilers, profilers, virtual machines and softare development methodologies will have to be smarter, and will use more and more artificial intelligence techniques.

   Intelligent Mobile Ad Hoc Networking I-MANET  
  
 In ad hoc networking, an efficient management needs to take in account various constraints: quality of services, topology traffics, reliability. This management becomes more difficult when collaborative services must be supported (sensor analysis, decision making, distributed agreement, data analysis). The research approach combines constraint solving techniques with optimised link state protocols to provide new service admission schemes.

 About CPAIOR    
 The aim of the CPAIOR conference series is to bring together interested researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques or new applications, and to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in the others. A main objective of this conference series is to give researchers the opportunity to show how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to interesting results on large and complex problems.   

 Typically, papers presented at CPAIOR actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas. High quality papers from a single area are usually also welcome. Finally, application papers showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on innovative and challenging applications or experience reports on such applications have been strongly encouraged.   

 After a successful series of five CPAIOR international workshops in Ferrara (Italy), Paderborn (Germany), Ashford (United Kingdom), Le Croisic (France), and Montreal (Canada), in 2004 CPAIOR became a conference with the first meeting held in Nice (France) with more than 100 participants. In the subsequent years, CPAIOR was held in Prague (Czech Republic), Cork (Ireland), Brussels (Belgium), Paris (France), Pittsburgh (USA), Bologna (Italy), Berlin (Germany), Nantes (France), Yorktown Heights, NY (USA), Cork (Ireland), Barcelona (Spain), Banff (Canada), Padova (Italy), Delft (Netherlands), Thessaloniki (Greece), Zoom, Vienna (Austria), Los Angeles, CA (USA), Nice (France), and Uppsala (Sweden), while the upcoming meeting takes place in Melbourne (Australia).   

 Proceedings of this peer-reviewed conference are published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. In some cases, a selection of papers is published in a special issue of a journal after another round of reviewing. This has been standardized in recent years via a Journal Fast-Track reviewing process.

CPM Archive  
 The purpose of this page is to serve as a repository of the presentations and other electronic material related to the Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM) conferences. Combinatorial Pattern Matching addresses issues of searching  , indexing  and matching  strings and more complicated structures such as trees, regular expressions, graphs, point sets, arrays, etc. The goal is to derive non-trivial combinatorial properties for such structures and then to exploit these properties in order to achieve improved performance for the corresponding computational problem.  
 The first CPM conference was held in Paris in 1990. Since then the conference has been organized annually.

 ICSS 2024  10th Industrial Control System Security Workshop Held in conjunction with the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), Waikiki, Hawaii, Dec 10, 2024. [posted here 8/12/24]   
  Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial control systems (ICS) monitor and control a wide range of critical industrial and infrastructure processes, such as water treatment, power generation and transmission, oil and gas refining, and manufacturing. Furthermore, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is rapidly expanding the interconnectivity of ICS environments and introducing many new threats. These environments have been identified as a key target of more generic threats (ransomware, e.g., CL0p), along with more recent tailored nation-state threats targeting electric transmission and distribution systems (e.g., COSMICENERGY). The essential requirement for high availability in SCADA and industrial control systems, along with the use of resource-constrained computing devices, legacy operating systems, and proprietary software applications, limits the applicability of traditional information security solutions. The goal of this workshop is to explore new techniques that are more effective and efficient at improving the security and resilience of critical control systems in the face of emerging threats.

  Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field. Following this story of success, IEEE initiated the European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), which is organized every year in a European city. The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

 ICSS 2024  10th Industrial Control System Security Workshop Held in conjunction with the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), Waikiki, Hawaii, Dec 10, 2024. [posted here 8/12/24]   
  Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial control systems (ICS) monitor and control a wide range of critical industrial and infrastructure processes, such as water treatment, power generation and transmission, oil and gas refining, and manufacturing. Furthermore, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is rapidly expanding the interconnectivity of ICS environments and introducing many new threats. These environments have been identified as a key target of more generic threats (ransomware, e.g., CL0p), along with more recent tailored nation-state threats targeting electric transmission and distribution systems (e.g., COSMICENERGY). The essential requirement for high availability in SCADA and industrial control systems, along with the use of resource-constrained computing devices, legacy operating systems, and proprietary software applications, limits the applicability of traditional information security solutions. The goal of this workshop is to explore new techniques that are more effective and efficient at improving the security and resilience of critical control systems in the face of emerging threats.

 Welcome to Rome   
 The Eternal City welcomes you! Throughout the centuries, the magic of Rome has been recounted on paper in the words of poets and writers, wonderfully depicted in the works of great artists. Rome's grandiose monuments, hundreds of churches, and spectacular fountains outline its marvellous skyline, making it the city with the highest concentration of historical, archaeological, and architectural heritage worldwide. Its historic centre, bounded by the perimeter of the Aurelian Walls, is an overlay of evidence spanning nearly three millennia and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The heart of Catholic Christianity, Rome is also the only city in the world to host a foreign state within its borders, the enclave of Vatican City.

  Paper Submission & Guidelines  

 All contributions must be submitted via EasyChair  (please exclusively use this provided link for submissions). As per tradition, paper designated as "full paper" will be included in the post-proceedings published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (LNCS). Regular paper submission guidelines  
 The following two paper categories are welcome. Any submission must be explicitly marked as “full paper” or “short paper”. Full papers | – scientific research papers, surveying works and industrial experiences describing significant C(I)IP advances. Papers should be no longer than 20 pages, including bibliography and well‐marked appendices. These submissions correspond to what was previously indicated as "regular papers" in the call for papers. 
  Short papers | – early results or work in progress with initial findings. Papers should be 4 to 6 pages long, including bibliography and well‐marked appendices. These submissions correspond to what was previously indicated as "ongoing research" in the call for papers. Short papers will be presented as posters and they will NOT be included in the post-proceedings published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). 
  All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. All paper submissions must contain a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. All submissions will be subjected to a thorough double‐blind review  by at least three reviewers. Submitted papers shall be anonymised, and all author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, and obvious traceable references should be eliminated to be eligible for the review process. Submission  
 Submitted manuscripts should represent significant and novel research contributions. All manuscripts will have to be submitted in anonymized form for double-blind review. (See https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228027-effectiveness-of-anonymization-in-double-blind-review/abstract  for arguments substantiating this change.) To that effect: The title page should not contain any author names or affiliations. 
  Authors should carefully review figures and appendices (especially survey instruments) to ensure affiliations are not accidentally included. 
  When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Only blind the reference itself in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. 
  Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. Neither the link in the paper nor the website or any of the materials therein may contain the authors’ names and affiliations. 
  Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc. during the review process. Submissions should be made according to the Springer LNCS format. For optimisation reasons, authors are encourage to use the following LaTeX Proceedings Templates  , available in the scentific autoring platform Overleaf. For detailed guidelines, please refer to the official Guidelines for Authors of Papers to be Published in Springer Computer Science Proceedings.  . Kindly note that we prefer the use of American English  . Maximum length of text abstracts: 180 words.

 Venue  
   
 The CRITIS 2024 conference will be hosted at the Department of Civil, Computer Science and Aeronautical Technologies Engineering  of the University of Roma Tre, located in Rome, Italy. You can find us at Via Vito Volterra 62  , nestled within the Marconi district in the southern quadrant of the city.  
 How to Reach the Venue  
 The pedestrian entrance to the venue is located in Via Vito Volterra 62  . The most efficient and straightforward route to reach the venue is by metro, with the nearest station being Stazione Basilica S. Paolo on the B line (also known as blue line). From there, you can easily reach the venue with just a 10-minute walk  following these directions:  
 Upon exiting the station, head towards the Basilica di San Paolo. If you're on the right side, you'll easily spot the white bell tower of the Basilica. 
  Proceed to cross the traffic light and continue westward along Viale Ferdinando Baldelli, staying left-hand sidewalk. 
  At the traffic lights, shortly after passing the Bambino Gesù Hospital, make a left turn onto Via Tullio Levi Civita, ensuring you stay on the right-hand sidewalk. 
  As soon as you reach the intersection of Via Tullio Levi Civita and Viale Marconi, cross Viale Marconi. 
  Continue straight for one more block along Via Corrado Segrè. Here, you will reach the pedestrian gate of the Faculty, identifiable by the University's distinctive pyramid-shaped logo. 
  Alternatively, bus 170, which connects Stazione Termini (an interchange stop between the A and B metro lines) with the EUR district, stops at Viale Guglielmo Marconi, just one block away from the venue in both southbound and northbound directions. Additionally, bus 23 departs from the terminal bus stop at Largo San Leonardo Murialdo, just a 5-minute walk from the venue, and provides a direct connection to the Vatican City district. It's important to note that the bus service may experience delays during heavy traffic or rush hours. Furthermore, bus 670 has its terminus at Via Salvatore Pincherle, which is about 400 meters far from the conference venue. It is important to note that the bus service may experience delays during heavy traffic or rush hours.  
 Parking Spots  
 A spacious free car parking lot, open until late evening, is conveniently located just 50 meters from the venue at Via della Vasca Navale 109  . To reach the venue from there, simply head east until you reach the gate at Via della Vasca Navale 81  .

  Backgrounds 
  This marks the 6th edition of the International Workshop on Engineering and Cybersecurity of Critical Systems (EnCyCriS) at the ICSE conference.  
 For industrial critical systems, although the previous premises of increasing system interconnectivity, decentralization, and introduction of new, more intelligent technologies still hold true, there is an increased societal awareness with regards to cybersecurity. This has led to clearer regulation, sharper requirements, and higher expectations for industry. At the same time, the availability of readily deployable competence, methods, tools, and solutions is lacking, which should be considered a critical societal risk.  
 In the current international political climate, cyber security, and safety of critical infrastructures across industry, are more important than ever before. The EnCyCriS workshop facilitates discourse and discussion amongst researchers, practitioners, and students who are working on challenges and solutions related to industrial critical infrastructure. It has a particular focus on sharing industry experience and project results pertaining to cyber threats on critical systems, secure systems engineering, and attack detection and response mechanisms.

 UPDATE  : submission extended until November 20th.  

 Backgrounds  
   
 With the aim of further strengthening the relevance of cybersecurity research for critical infrastructures, whilst being relevant and useful to industry, the following workshop research objectives are suggested:  
 Integrated safety and security software engineering processes and methods for critical infrastructures that enable coordination among different stakeholders, including several teams and personnel with different competencies, and continuous integration of new and emerging technologies. 
  Threat landscape for digital systems’ software in critical infrastructure and the modelling of cyber-attack scenarios for digital systems’ architecture and inter-dependencies. This includes accurate software architecture design model specifications that facilitate cybersecurity and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) assessment. Models should support effective communication of threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and potential mitigations to relevant stakeholders to support decision-making. 
  The role and impact of black and grey-box technologies such as AI, machine-learning algorithms, off-the-shelf components (COTS), and supply chain elements, including third party services, on the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures. How do we estimate and handle the vulnerabilities potentially introduced by black-box technologies to achieve and maintain acceptable levels of risk throughout the life cycle of software, components, systems and solutions? How do we enable and empower stakeholders to address emerging threats and developing vulnerabilities more dynamically, with the aim of achieving greater resilience? 
  The applications of digital twins, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Hardware-In-the-Loop test beds, simulators and/or emulators, and algorithms developed for cyber security purposes in critical infrastructures, especially to understand the consequences of a cyber-attack at an overall system level. Evaluate the effectiveness of the risk models, detection and response tools, and/or methods developed. 
  The impact and importance of human factors in critical infrastructures systems and software development and operations, throughout the lifecycle of critical systems. How to prepare stakeholders such as developers, system operators and organizations to best handle unforeseen and unpredictable adverse cyber situations and events? How to overcome shortcomings in existing tools, methods, competence, and standards and regulations when planning and implementing cyber security response mechanisms and solutions. 
  The workshop topical areas   
 Practical safety and security co-engineering - challenges and solutions for critical infrastructure and industrial software-intensive systems. 
  Threat and vulnerability identification and impact estimation for response of cyber effects on software and hardware of critical infrastructures using models, simulations, and digital twins. 
  The role, impact, and unsolved challenges of human, technology and organization in cybersecurity of critical infrastructures and complex socio-technical systems. 
  Systems and software development - the impact and importance of human factors on the cyber resilience of operational technology and information technology systems and infrastructures. 
  The topics given above serve as guidance for the focus of the workshop and should not be seen as absolute. Adaptations to the workshop may be expected depending on the paper contributions and participants’ profiles.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 Submissions  
 Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.  
 The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body  . Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.  
 The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.  

 Review Process  
 Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.
