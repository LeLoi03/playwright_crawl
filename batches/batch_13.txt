  Submission Categories   
 Research Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 A research paper must address a topic related to software engineering education using appropriate research techniques and proper scholarly writing. Negative and mixed findings are welcome.  
 Experience Report  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned.  
 Industry Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting.  
 Idea Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results.  
 Tool Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough.  
 Replication Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances.  
 Journal-first Submission  (max 1 page)  
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site.  
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:  
 Research Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation 
  Experience Reports  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Actionability, Lessons, Presentation 
  Industry Papers  will be evaluated like Research Papers  when presenting research results and like Experience Reports  when reporting on experiences 
  Idea Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Tool Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Presentation 
  Replication Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Journal-first Submissions  will be evaluated based on their own category, as described above. 
  The evaluation criteria are defined as follows:  
 Relevance | : The extent to which the paper is relevant to CSEE&T. 
  Significance | : The extent to which the paper is well-motivated and its contributions are original and important, with respect to the existing literature on software engineering education and training. 
  Soundness | : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods and whether the paper discusses meaningfully the research methods’ limitations and threats to the validity of the findings. 
  Verifiability | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. This includes public availability of research data. In cases where this is not possible, an explicit statement covering why such data cannot be made publicly available is mandatory. 
  Actionability | : The extent to which the paper provides actionable advice with clear take-away messages. 
  Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
  Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
  How to Submit   
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
  All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
  By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the IEEE | , | submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site   by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review  .  
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.  
 Open Science Policy   
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable.  
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified.  
 IMPORTANT  : We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability  after the Conclusion  section. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via the HotCRP submission site  . Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.  
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 Change and defect management 
  Code cloning and provenance 
  Concept and feature location 
  Continuous integration/deployment 
  Empirical studies of software maintenance and evolution 
  Evolution of non-code artifacts 
  Evolution and maintenance of AI-based applications 
  Human factors and social aspects of software maintenance and evolution 
  Large Language Models for software evolution and maintenance tasks 
  Maintenance and evolution of model-based methods 
  Maintenance and evolution of mobile apps 
  Maintenance and evolution of service-oriented and cloud computing systems 
  Maintenance and evolution processes 
  Maintenance versus release process 
  Mining software repositories 
  Productivity of software engineers during maintenance and evolution 
  Release engineering 
  Reverse engineering and re-engineering 
  Run-time evolution and dynamic configuration 
  Software and system comprehension 
  Software migration and renovation 
  Software quality assessment 
  Software refactoring and restructuring 
  Software testing theory and practice 
  Source code analysis and manipulation 
  Technical Debt 
  ICSME welcomes innovative ideas that are timely, well-presented, and evaluated. All submissions must position themselves within the existing literature, describe the relevance of the results to specific software engineering goals, and include a clear motivation and presentation of the work. All submissions must be in English and follow the paper submission guidelines below.  
 All papers must be full papers.   
 Evaluation   
 Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be desk-rejected without being reviewed. All submissions that meet the submission criteria and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The importance of contribution, originality, quality of presentation, soundness, evaluation (where applicable), and appropriate comparison to related work will be assessed for all submissions. Where applicable (e.g., empirical studies and other technical contributions with an evaluation), the replicability of the work will be evaluated.  
 Paper Submission   
 Please use the following link to submit to the research track: URL to submission system available soon   
 Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to ICSME 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2025. Submitting the same paper to different tracks of ICSME 2025 is also not allowed. ICSME 2025 will use a double anonymous reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules:  
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins.) 
  References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, instead of “We build on our previous work…”, use “We build on the work of…”). 
  The title of the submission must be different from the authors’ preprints on arXiv or similar sites. Authors must not publicly use the submission title during the review period. 
  Please see more information regarding the double-anonymous review: https://icsme.github.io/faq_double_blind.html   
 Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Please use the templates available here. LaTeX users should use the following configuration: \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}  . Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template. Papers must not exceed 10 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references. All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the ICSME 2025 EasyChair link. All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct.  
 Papers that do not comply with the submission guidelines will be desk-rejected and not be sent to the PC for review.   
 Special Issue   
 We plan to organize a Special Issue for ICSME 2025. Details will be added later. Papers for the Special Issue will be expected to comply with the standard guidelines for publishing an extended version of a paper, including the addition of about 30% new material.  
 Author Response Period   
 As in 2024, ICSME 2025 will offer an author response period. During this period, the authors will have the opportunity to inspect the reviews and answer specific questions raised by the program committee. This period is scheduled after all reviews have been completed and discussed, to inform the subsequent decision-making process. Authors will be able to see the full reviews, including the reviewer scores as part of the author response process.  
 Early decisions   
 As in 2024, ICSME 2025 will make early decisions: If reviewers already decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response. Conversely, if the paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation significantly, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be asked to submit a response. All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. However, as customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.  
 This approach ensures that author responses are primarily reserved for cases with some controversy or where the reviewers have specific and pertinent inquiries to be addressed.  
 Publication and Presentation   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete an electronic IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference. Failure of at least one author to register by the early registration date will result in the paper being withdrawn from the conference proceedings. Also, IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if the paper is not presented at the conference. Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.  
 Open Science Policy   
 ICSME encourages open science. Sharing of data sets, replication packages, or preprints is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified, for example, in the case of industry data subject to confidentiality issues or legal requirements.  
 However, PC members are not required to run code and check details of the artifact, but are asked to comment on its inclusion (specifically whether the data/code promised in the paper is available in the artifact).  
 Upon submission, authors should do one of the following:  
 make their data available to the program committee via an online archival (see below), 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable, or 
  indicate that they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. 
  Note that, even if not intentional, the last option can create doubt in reviewers’ minds as to why the data is not made available for review. Accordingly, we strongly encourage following one of the first two options.  
 When sharing data, please use an online archival site such as zenodo.org  , figshare.com  , or osf.io  . These sites ensure that the content is archived and they generate a DOI for the content, enabling it to be cited. To learn more about how to share data while maintaining double-anonymous, you may refer to the guidelines provided by Daniel Graziotin  .  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science  , which is an open-source tool that helps you quickly double anonymous your repository.  
 ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access (also called self-archiving). We encourage authors to self-archive a preprint of their accepted manuscript in an e-print server such as arXiv.org  . Open access increases the availability of your work and increases citation impact  . To learn more about open access, please read the Green Open Access FAQ by Arie van Deursen  .  
 If possible, we recommend that you archive your paper (e.g., on arXiv or on your website) only after the ICSME reviewing process is completed, to avoid undermining the double-anonymous reviewing process.  
 Authors of papers accepted into ICSME 2025 will be invited to submit their artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Track. Papers with accepted artifacts will be awarded badges and invited to present lightning talks at the ROSE (Recognising and Rewarding Open Science in Software Engineering) Festival. Please see the Call for Participation for the Artifact Evaluation Track.  
 For inquiries regarding Open Science and artifacts, we invite you to reach out to the ROSE Festival and artifacts chairs Cuiyun Gao  and Kevin Moran  .

  Large Language Models for software evolution and maintenance tasks 
  Maintenance and evolution of model-based methods 
  Maintenance and evolution of mobile apps 
  Maintenance and evolution of service-oriented and cloud computing systems 
  Maintenance and evolution processes 
  Maintenance versus release process 
  Mining software repositories 
  Productivity of software engineers during maintenance and evolution 
  Release engineering 
  Reverse engineering and re-engineering 
  Run-time evolution and dynamic configuration 
  Software and system comprehension 
  Software migration and renovation 
  Software quality assessment 
  Software refactoring and restructuring 
  Software testing theory and practice 
  Source code analysis and manipulation 
  Technical Debt 
  ICSME welcomes innovative ideas that are timely, well-presented, and evaluated. All submissions must position themselves within the existing literature, describe the relevance of the results to specific software engineering goals, and include a clear motivation and presentation of the work. All submissions must be in English and follow the paper submission guidelines below.  
 All papers must be full papers.   
 Evaluation   
 Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be desk-rejected without being reviewed. All submissions that meet the submission criteria and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The importance of contribution, originality, quality of presentation, soundness, evaluation (where applicable), and appropriate comparison to related work will be assessed for all submissions. Where applicable (e.g., empirical studies and other technical contributions with an evaluation), the replicability of the work will be evaluated.  
 Paper Submission   
 Please use the following link to submit to the research track: URL to submission system available soon   
 Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to ICSME 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2025. Submitting the same paper to different tracks of ICSME 2025 is also not allowed. ICSME 2025 will use a double anonymous reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules:  
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins.) 
  References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, instead of “We build on our previous work…”, use “We build on the work of…”). 
  The title of the submission must be different from the authors’ preprints on arXiv or similar sites. Authors must not publicly use the submission title during the review period. 
  Please see more information regarding the double-anonymous review: https://icsme.github.io/faq_double_blind.html   
 Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Please use the templates available here. LaTeX users should use the following configuration: \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}  . Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template. Papers must not exceed 10 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references. All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the ICSME 2025 EasyChair link. All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct.  
 Papers that do not comply with the submission guidelines will be desk-rejected and not be sent to the PC for review.   
 Special Issue   
 We plan to organize a Special Issue for ICSME 2025. Details will be added later. Papers for the Special Issue will be expected to comply with the standard guidelines for publishing an extended version of a paper, including the addition of about 30% new material.  
 Author Response Period   
 As in 2024, ICSME 2025 will offer an author response period. During this period, the authors will have the opportunity to inspect the reviews and answer specific questions raised by the program committee. This period is scheduled after all reviews have been completed and discussed, to inform the subsequent decision-making process. Authors will be able to see the full reviews, including the reviewer scores as part of the author response process.  
 Early decisions   
 As in 2024, ICSME 2025 will make early decisions: If reviewers already decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response. Conversely, if the paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation significantly, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be asked to submit a response. All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. However, as customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.  
 This approach ensures that author responses are primarily reserved for cases with some controversy or where the reviewers have specific and pertinent inquiries to be addressed.  
 Publication and Presentation   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete an electronic IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference. Failure of at least one author to register by the early registration date will result in the paper being withdrawn from the conference proceedings. Also, IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if the paper is not presented at the conference. Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.  
 Open Science Policy   
 ICSME encourages open science. Sharing of data sets, replication packages, or preprints is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified, for example, in the case of industry data subject to confidentiality issues or legal requirements.  
 However, PC members are not required to run code and check details of the artifact, but are asked to comment on its inclusion (specifically whether the data/code promised in the paper is available in the artifact).  
 Upon submission, authors should do one of the following:  
 make their data available to the program committee via an online archival (see below), 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable, or 
  indicate that they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. 
  Note that, even if not intentional, the last option can create doubt in reviewers’ minds as to why the data is not made available for review. Accordingly, we strongly encourage following one of the first two options.  
 When sharing data, please use an online archival site such as zenodo.org  , figshare.com  , or osf.io  . These sites ensure that the content is archived and they generate a DOI for the content, enabling it to be cited. To learn more about how to share data while maintaining double-anonymous, you may refer to the guidelines provided by Daniel Graziotin  .  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science  , which is an open-source tool that helps you quickly double anonymous your repository.  
 ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access (also called self-archiving). We encourage authors to self-archive a preprint of their accepted manuscript in an e-print server such as arXiv.org  . Open access increases the availability of your work and increases citation impact  . To learn more about open access, please read the Green Open Access FAQ by Arie van Deursen  .  
 If possible, we recommend that you archive your paper (e.g., on arXiv or on your website) only after the ICSME reviewing process is completed, to avoid undermining the double-anonymous reviewing process.  
 Authors of papers accepted into ICSME 2025 will be invited to submit their artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Track. Papers with accepted artifacts will be awarded badges and invited to present lightning talks at the ROSE (Recognising and Rewarding Open Science in Software Engineering) Festival. Please see the Call for Participation for the Artifact Evaluation Track.  
 For inquiries regarding Open Science and artifacts, we invite you to reach out to the ROSE Festival and artifacts chairs Cuiyun Gao  and Kevin Moran  .

  Submissions must be unpublished original work and should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under consideration. 
  Submissions to ICSR 2025 must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). 
  Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to ICSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. The authors also acknowledge that they conform to the authorship policy of the ACM and the authorship policy of the IEEE.

  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  Authors are encouraged to title their submission differently than preprints of the authors on ArXiV or similar sites. During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. 
  By submitting to ICSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. In particular, papers submitted to ICSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 2025 Co-located Event Proceedings and included in the IEEE and ACM Digital Libraries. Authors of accepted papers are required to register and present their accepted paper at the conference in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and the Digital Libraries.  
 Authors of rejected long papers may receive an acceptance as a short paper if the PC chairs and reviewers agree that it better meets the criteria for short papers. In this case, authors may decide to accept or reject the invitation if they would rather submit as a long paper to a different venue.

 ICSME  
 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution  
    
 Since its start in 1983, ICSM (International Conference on Software Maintenance) has grown and developed into an international forum for software maintenance researchers and practitioners to examine key issues facing the software maintenance community. Participants from academia, government, and industry share ideas and experiences solving critical software maintenance problems. Reflecting the importance of evolutionary challenges in software maintenance, starting from 2014 ICSM became known as as the International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME). ICSME is the premier international (world wide) event in the maintenance field. The importance of software maintenance is being increasingly recognised, both in terms of professional activities and of public perception. Hence it is vital for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results in the field. The ICSME proceedings present works of outstanding international excellence, where reports on the latest advances in the field may be found.  
 Beware of other conferences that call themselves ICSM/ICSME, which are not IEEE sponsored or affiliated with ICSME.    
 Next Conference:  ICSME 2024  will be held in Flagstaff, USA

 ICSME 2024  
   
 The International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and debate the most recent ideas, experiences, and challenges in software maintenance and evolution. The 40th edition of the conference (ICSME 2024) will be in Flagstaff, AZ, United States.  
 Why Flagstaff?   
 There are SEVERAL reasons to come to Flagstaff besides ICSME    
 Located in the mountains of northern Arizona, Flagstaff is not  the Arizona experience you may expect  . Flagstaff enjoys mild temperatures due to its high altitude (7000 feet / 2100 meters) and low humidity. In October, Flagstaff’s average high temperature in the afternoon is 18 o  C (64 F), and the daily low temperature in the middle of the night is 0 o  C (32 F).  
 Although Flagstaff is a relatively small city, it is a major tourist destination  that receives more than 5 million tourists per year  because of its proximity to many tourist attractions. It is close to Grand Canyon National Park and in the midst of a large Ponderosa pine forest. Rich with excitement and alive with cultural diversity, beauty, and history, visitors are attracted to the clean mountain air, year-round outdoor recreation, lively festivals, and historic charm.  
 Hiking and nature are the highlights of Flagstaff. Some of the attractions that Flagstaff offers:  
 The | Grand Canyon | is a worldwide recognized tourist destination (less than a two-hour drive from Flagstaff). 
  Sedona | is renowned for its stunning red rock landscapes and vibrant arts community. It draws visitors from around the world and is less than a one-hour drive from Flagstaff. 
  Sunset Crater, Walnut Canyon, and Wupatki | National Monuments are also less than a one-hour drive from Flagstaff. 
  Monument Valley | , frequently featured in Holywood movies, is less than three hours driving from Flagstaff. Take the opportunity and also visit the Antelope Canyon (reservation in advance is recommended). 
  The | Museum of Northern Arizona | and | Lowell Observatory | (where Pluto was discovered in 1930) are located just minutes from downtown Flagstaff. 
  Route 66 | remains a historic route, passing through Flagstaff. U.S. Route 66, or Mother Road, was one of the original highways in the U.S. It is recognized in popular culture, including music, movies, and cartoons. 
  Find more details in the Attending menu.  
 Flying to Flagstaff   
 You can fly directly to Flagstaff Pulliam Airport (FLG). However, it is currently served only by American Airlines and its Oneworld alliance partners. Another option is to fly to Phoenix (PHX) and take a 3-hour shuttle or bus ( Groome.com  , FlixBus  , or Greyhound  ) from the airport to the conference venue or rent a car and drive for approximately 2 hours. Alternatively, you can fly to Las Vegas (LAS), which is a longer but scenic drive to Flagstaff.

  Submission Form   
 Research and experience papers should be submitted to ( https://icsr25.hotcrp.com/  ). The submission deadline is firm, no extensions.  
 All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 Page limit is 10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for long papers and 5 pages plus 1 additional page for references for short papers. 
  Submissions must be unpublished original work and should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under consideration. 
  Submissions to ICSR 2025 must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). 
  Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to ICSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. The authors also acknowledge that they conform to the authorship policy of the ACM and the authorship policy of the IEEE. 
  Paper review will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submitted paper. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  Authors are encouraged to title their submission differently than preprints of the authors on ArXiV or similar sites. During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. 
  By submitting to ICSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. In particular, papers submitted to ICSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 2025 Co-located Event Proceedings and included in the IEEE and ACM Digital Libraries. Authors of accepted papers are required to register and present their accepted paper at the conference in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and the Digital Libraries.  
 Authors of rejected long papers may receive an acceptance as a short paper if the PC chairs and reviewers agree that it better meets the criteria for short papers. In this case, authors may decide to accept or reject the invitation if they would rather submit as a long paper to a different venue.

In particular, papers submitted to ICSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 2025 Co-located Event Proceedings and included in the IEEE and ACM Digital Libraries. Authors of accepted papers are required to register and present their accepted paper at the conference in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and the Digital Libraries.  
 Authors of rejected long papers may receive an acceptance as a short paper if the PC chairs and reviewers agree that it better meets the criteria for short papers. In this case, authors may decide to accept or reject the invitation if they would rather submit as a long paper to a different venue.

 ICSSP 2019: Hybrid and Evolving Processes for Software and Systems   
 Software engineering continuously reinvents the way software and software intensive systems are built. Just in February 2018, Bombardier and Siemens announced significant investments in optimizing their product development processes. Tesla is trying to revolutionize the automotive market by implementing continuous delivery in safety critical systems. Appreciation of the implications of blockchain technology for software and systems processes is starting to grow. In this evolving landscape, many companies are making efforts to move towards new technologies and tools, agile principles, and continuous integration and delivery. In doing so, they find opportunity, flexibility, and strength in evolving toward hybrid processes, which are neither purely traditional nor can count as text-book agile. ICSSP 2019 will provide a special platform for research focusing on hybrid processes for software and systems development as well as the factors driving their evolution.  
 The ICSSP Conference Series   
 ICSSP 2019 is the latest in a series of conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association. The ISSPA has sponsored or co-sponsored seven previous ICSSP conferences, held at sites around the world, dating back to 2011. Proceedings of the ICSSP conferences are available through the ACM Digital Library. Extended versions of selected papers from several years have been published in the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process (Wiley). More information about the International Software and Systems Process Association is available here  .

 Call for Submissions  
  
 Software engineering continuously reinvents the way software and software intensive systems are built. Just in February 2018, Bombardier and Siemens announced significant investments in optimizing their product development processes. Tesla is trying to revolutionize the automotive market by implementing continuous delivery in safety critical systems. Appreciation of the implications of blockchain technology for software and systems processes is starting to grow. In this evolving landscape, many companies are making efforts to move towards new technologies, tools, agile principles, and continuous integration and delivery. In doing so, they find opportunity, flexibility, and strength in evolving toward hybrid processes, which are neither purely traditional nor can count as text-book agile.  
 ICSSP 2019 will provide a special platform for research focusing on hybrid processes for software and systems development as well as the factors driving their evolution. As a community, we ask: What will the next generation of process paradigms look like? How will they emerge from current paradigms? How will the concerns of business and system stakeholders drive and reflect the development and evolution of processes in coming years? What can our experience of change teach us?  To help answer these questions, ICSSP 2019 is seeking contributions on research, practice, and compelling new ideas pertaining, but not limited, to the following topics:  
 Origins and evolution of hybrid processes 
  Specification, implementation, and operation of hybrid processes 
  Hybrid processes in systems engineering 
  Measurement for hybrid and evolving processes 
  Empirical studies and experience reports on agile or hybrid processes 
  Factors affecting selection, design, adoption, management and success of hybrid processes 
  Processes across enterprise domains and business functions 
  Integrating agile and non-agile processes 
  Experiences in combining life-cycles, functional domains, and development organizations 
  Impacts of special requirements such as high safety/reliability, globally distributed development, continuous integration, and others 
  Evolution or transformation of organizations 
  Enterprise processes for advanced development paradigms such as agile, lean, DevOps or customer-centric development 
  Data science for analysis and management of hybrid and evolving processes 
  All accepted papers will be included in the ICSSP Proceedings, which will be published as part of the ICSE companion proceedings.  
 We invite the following submissions:  
 Full papers   (10 pages including references) that reflect completed and evaluated research on novel approaches to major software and systems engineering process challenges, especially relating to hybrid and evolving processes. Enhanced versions of the best research papers will be included in a special issue of the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process. Full papers can also be industry experience papers that report and reflect on in-depth experience, potentially including challenges, solutions, lessons, and recommendations, of significance for the research and practice communities.  
 Short papers   (5 pages including references) that present concise research results, describe work-in-progress (e.g. Ph. D. research), or conceptual and position papers addressing new perspectives, open questions and future directions. Short papers can also be industrial papers, for instance, describing practical challenges or research needs motivated by experience.  
 Posters   (2 pages extended abstract (including references) + DIN A2 poster draft) for research or industry experience that is not yet ready for publication as a paper, but nevertheless would be of interest to other researchers in terms of ideas, participation, or collaboration.  
 NEW:  Additionally, for 2019 ICSSP is introducing a Doctoral Track  for the first time. See the Doctoral Track  tab for the call and instructions on how to submit to the ICSSP Doctoral Track.  
 See the Submitting  tab for instructions on how to submit to the ICSSP main track. Please direct questions and comments about the main track to ICSSP2019 at EasyChair  .

 Doctoral Track  
   
 Call for ICSSP 2019 Doctoral Track Submissions   
 The International Conference on Software and Systems Process (ICSSP 2019) invites submissions for consideration for inclusion in the ICSSP 2019 Doctoral Track which will be hosted as an integral part of the main ICSSP 2019 programme. Successful submissions will present to the main ICSSP 2019 audience and as such offers an excellent opportunity for current Ph.D. candidates to present their work and elicit feedback from the ICSSP community, which is comprised of some of the leading figures in the software and systems process domain.  
 The goal of the ICSSP community in hosting the Doctoral Track is driven by a keen appreciation of the importance of Doctoral studies and the many benefits that expert community-led constructive feedback can deliver in terms of enhancing Doctoral work, while also supporting leading researchers of the future. Thus, the Track offers a rare opportunity to obtain valuable expert feedback and to get in touch with peer students in the same field of interest. The event is designed with 2nd/3rd year PhD candidates in mind, and particularly where initial results are not yet mature enough for a full conference paper and the work going forward may benefit from feedback from the ICSSP community. The ICSSP Doctoral Track should address topics of interest to ICSSP 2019 and also more generally, all research areas that are in scope of the ICSSP conference series. Successful submissions will be published in the main conference proceedings.  
 Doctoral Track papers shall present research progress to date, current work-in-progress and plan to completion. Please note that the sole author on the submission must be the doctoral candidate and that advisor(s) should be noted immediately below the author details. Submissions should address the following concerns:  
 Motivation  : describe the problem that you want to address and briefly summarize existing approaches along with their deficiencies. 
  Objectives  : outline the key objectives of your PhD research and argue how achieving them will address the problem outlined in the motivation. 
  Methodology  : identify what methodology you will adopt to meet the objectives of your project. Clearly state on what existing works your work will build. 
  Research challenges  : outline the technical, methodological, conceptual, or other hurdles faced in completing the research. 
  Research Plan  : describe what preliminary results – if any – you have already achieved and summarize your plans for future work. Please add a rough schedule that allows to judge whether your research plan is feasible. 
  Authors of selected submissions will be required to produce and present a Poster to reflect their ICSSP 2019 Doctoral Track paper, which will be displayed alongside the main ICSE 2019 Posters. Details on poster formats will be provided in due course.  
 Note: All important information specific to the Doctoral Track can be found on this page. Some of this information differs from the corresponding items for the Main Track.   
 Preconditions for Submission   
 As with the main ICSSP conference, all submissions must comply with the ACM and IEEE policies on authorship and publication. These include:  
 The Policy on Roles and Responsibilities in ACM Publishing  as they apply to authors 
  The ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism 
  The ACM policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions 
  The IEEE guidance on publishing ethics 
  Note that submitted papers must reflect the original work of the authors, the authors must be entitled to publish the work, the work must not have been published previously in a refereed or formally reviewed publication, and the work must not be under review or in press elsewhere while under review for the ICSSP Doctoral Track,  among other provisions.  
 How to Submit   
 Submissions to the ICSSP 2019 Doctoral Track must be up to a maximum of 4 pages in length. Papers not adhering to this page length requirement will not be admitted to the review process. Page limits include all text, figures, tables, references, and appendices. All submissions must be in English.  
 Important  : ICSSP is NOT following a double-blind reviewing process, so author name(s) and affiliation(s) should appear beneath the title of a submission. (This is different from the policy followed by ICSE and some other co-located events.)  
 Submissions  must conform to the  IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines    (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTEX users must use  \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the   compsoc   or   compsocconf  option).   
 Submissions must be made through the ICSSP submission site on EasyChair  prior to the submission deadline. Be sure to direct your submissions to the Doctoral Track and select “Student doctoral paper” when uploading your submission.  
 Authors of accepted papers shall prepare a final camera-ready version of the paper, taking into account all feedback from reviewers, and formatted according to the guidelines above.  
 Requirement for Letter of Recommendation   
 Each student submission must be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student’s research advisor(s). The letter of recommendation should ideally be brief, indicating that the student will be in a position to attend and present at the conference if their submission is successful, and including an assessment of the current status of the research, including an expected date for the dissertation’s filing (which may be approximate). Note that letters may be shared with reviewers of the submission but will generally be kept confidential.  
 Letters of recommendation must also be submitted through the ICSSP submission site on EasyChair  prior to the submission deadline. Be sure to direct your submissions to the Doctoral Track and select “Advisor letter of recommendation” when uploading your letter. The letter of recommendation must be received by the submission deadline. Submissions without a supporting letter of recommendation will not be reviewed.   
 Requirement to Register, Attend and Present   
 If a submission is accepted, the doctoral candidate must register for and attend the conference and present the paper in person. Failure to meet this requirement may result in the paper being withdrawn from the program and proceedings.   
 Review Process   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least two Doctoral Track Committee members. Submissions will be evaluated based on their relevance, the motivation and quality of the proposed research, as well as the suitability of the chosen methodology. The potential for students to benefit from participation in the Track may also be considered in making the final selection of accepted papers.

 Call for Papers  
  
 ICST 2025 invites high-quality submissions in all software testing, verification, and validation areas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 AI-assisted software testing 
  Automated test generation 
  Formal verification 
  Manual and social aspects of the software testing process 
  Replications, empirical studies, case studies, experience reports 
  Software reliability 
  Static and dynamic analysis 
  Test automation 
  Test-driven development and Agile testing 
  Testability, test design, and adequacy criteria 
  Testing AI-based systems 
  Testing and development processes 
  Testing, debugging, and repair tools 
  Testing education 
  Testing in specific domains, such as mobile, web, embedded/cyber-physical systems, concurrent, distributed, cloud, GUI, context-aware, IoT, real-time systems, video games, augmented/virtual reality applications 
  Testing of non-functional properties such as security, accessibility, and performance 
  Theory of software testing 
  Validation and user acceptance techniques 
  Papers for the research track should present novel and original work that advances the state-of-the-art. Case studies, replication studies, and empirical research papers are also welcome.  
 Papers with a strong industrial/practical component and focus more on impact than (technical) novelty are encouraged to consider the industry track instead.  
 Submission Format   
 Full Research papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format, and not exceed 10 pages, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices; two additional pages containing only references are permitted. It must conform to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (use the letter format template and conference option). The ICST 2025 research track only accepts full research papers. Short papers are not accepted to the research track.  
 Authors must comply with the IEEE Plagiarism Guidelines  . In particular, a submission must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review elsewhere while under review for ICST. The submission must also comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship  .  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the ICST 2025 Program Committee. We employ a double-blind reviewing process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities. Authors must make every effort to honour the double-anonymous review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission, and references to their prior work should be in the third person. All artifacts, such as replication packages and tools, associated with the submission must also be anonymized. Any submission that does not comply with the above requirements may be rejected by the PC Chairs without further review. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
 Submissions   
 Submissions to the Research Papers Track that meet the above requirements can be made via HotCRP at https://icst2025.hotcrp.com/  . If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ICST 2025 and present the paper. We expect that the conference will be in-person.  
 Replication Material   
 Submissions must supply all information needed to replicate the results and therefore are expected to include or point to an anonymized replication package with the necessary software, data, and instructions. The program committee may consult these packages to resolve open issues. If a paper does not come with a replication package, authors should comment on its absence.

 About ICSSP 2024  

 ICSSP 2024 will be held from 4-6 September 2024  

 ICSSP 2024 will take place from September 4-6, 2024, in Munich, Germany, as a hybrid event.  
 ICSSP 2024 is the 18th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association  (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.  
 Recent ICSSP conferences have been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by IEEE or ACM. After two ICSSP conferences co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE) in 2021 and 2022, and with CSRIO’s Data61 unit in 2023, in 2024 ICSSP is pleased to be joining forces with the European System, Software & Service Process Improvement & Innovation  (EuroSPI 2  ) conference.  

 Conference Theme  

 The theme for ICSSP 2024 is Sustainable Development  .  
 In 2015, United Nations Member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  , that defines 17 Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) to achieve “peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future”.  These goals address issues related to equality, health, education, the natural and built environment, and economic growth.  

 Topics  

 General contributions that address best emerging practice in software and systems engineering are welcome. In addition, we are especially interested in software and systems processes research that addresses sustainable development, such as:  
 Poverty, hunger, and health 
  Clean energy, clean water, and sanitation 
  Equality, justice, peace 
  Climate action 
  Sustainable consumption, production, innovation, and infrastructure 
   
 Examples of topics to address sustainable development goals in and through software and systems engineering include, but are not limited to:  
 Agile and other methods for sustainable global development 
  Techniques to address bias and inclusion in software development ecosystems and software products (especially those incorporating AI and/or machine learning) 
  Green software and systems engineering 
  Open Science and Open Data 
  Developing trust and integrity 
  Processes for digital public infrastructure, FutureGov, education, food systems transformation, and energy 
  Gamification of sustainable development goals 
  Sustainable software development 
  Processes related to distributed and hybrid working 
  Cloud infrastructure and program optimization that address improved power consumption 
  AI based software engineering 
  Alignment of AI with sustainable development 
  Software and AI enabled smart homes/living 
  Migrating software applications and systems to more sustainable infrastructure 
  Regulation for socially-critical software systems development 
  Software processes to achieve better work-life balance in software engineering 
  Issues related to gender, racial, or age equity in software and systems processes 
  Novel applications of software/systems process engineering to physical processes 
   
 Feel free to contact the PC Co-Chairs  if you are not sure whether or not your paper fits the scope of ICSSP 2024.

 About ICSSP Conference Series  
 ICSSP 2023 is the 17th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.  
 Recent ICSSP conferences have mostly been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by ACM or IEEE. The 2021 and 2022 conferences were co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE), and ICSSP 2022 was co-sponsored and co-organized with the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. For the 2023 ICSSP, the ISSPA is pleased to be joining forces with representatives of CSRIO's Data61 unit, the data and digital specialist arm of Australia's national science agency.  
 About ICSSP 2023  
 In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.  
 The Call for Papers  is available. The Abstract deadline is 6 January 2023, and the Submission deadline is 13 January 2023.

  In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.  
  Topics of Interest

   Submission Requirements and Policies  
 All submissions must conform to the ICSSP 2023 formatting and submission instructions and must not exceed the given page limits for the applicable type of submission. All submissions must be in English. Page limits include all text, figures, tables, references, and appendices. Only research papers are permitted up to two more pages containing only references. The page limit is strict, and purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed at any point in the process (including after the paper is accepted). All submissions must be in PDF.  
 Formatting  - Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.  
 Submission Site  - Submissions must be made through the ICSSP2023 submission site ( https://icse2023-icssp.hotcrp.com/  ) no later than the applicable submission deadline. Be sure to direct your submissions correctly and select the appropriate submission type when uploading your submission. We encourage authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later, but still before or on the date of the submission deadline AoE) to support the management of the review process.  
 Plagiarism Policy  - By submitting to ICSSP 2023, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. In particular, papers submitted to ICSSP 2023 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSSP 2023. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software to detect violations of these policies.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected by the PC Co-Chairs without further review.  
 Notice: The official publication date is the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Proceedings  - The proceedings will be published by IEEE, and will appear in the IEEE Xplore. The proceedings will only contain papers that have been presented at ICSSP 2023 and for which at least one author has registered.

 About ICSSP Conference Series  
 ICSSP 2023 is the 17th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.  
 Recent ICSSP conferences have mostly been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by ACM or IEEE. The 2021 and 2022 conferences were co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE), and ICSSP 2022 was co-sponsored and co-organized with the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. For the 2023 ICSSP, the ISSPA is pleased to be joining forces with representatives of CSRIO's Data61 unit, the data and digital specialist arm of Australia's national science agency.  
 About ICSSP 2023  
 In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.  
 The Call for Papers  is available. The Abstract deadline is 6 January 2023, and the Submission deadline is 13 January 2023.

 Submission Site  - Submissions must be made through the ICSSP2023 submission site ( https://icse2023-icssp.hotcrp.com/  ) no later than the applicable submission deadline. Be sure to direct your submissions correctly and select the appropriate submission type when uploading your submission. We encourage authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later, but still before or on the date of the submission deadline AoE) to support the management of the review process.  
 Plagiarism Policy  - By submitting to ICSSP 2023, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. In particular, papers submitted to ICSSP 2023 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSSP 2023. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software to detect violations of these policies.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected by the PC Co-Chairs without further review.  
 Notice: The official publication date is the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Proceedings  - The proceedings will be published by IEEE, and will appear in the IEEE Xplore. The proceedings will only contain papers that have been presented at ICSSP 2023 and for which at least one author has registered.  
 Reviewing  - All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the ICSSP 2023 program committee members. Each submitted research paper will receive reviews from at least three members of the specific program committee. ICSSP 2023 does not employ double-blind review process.  
 Requirement to Register, Attend, and Present  - Upon notification of acceptance, authors of accepted papers will be asked to complete a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for and attend the ICSSP 2023 and present the work. The organizers have the right to withdraw papers from the proceedings if there is no associated registration by two weeks past the authors' registration deadline. All accepted contributions with at least one registered author will be published in the conference electronic proceedings and appear in the IEEE Xplore.  
 Open Science Policy  - ICSSP 2023 encourages authors to submit artifact packages and/or data sets with their papers, for the sake of transparency, reusability, replicability, and/or reproducibility, as well as for facilitating the peer review process. The following guidelines are recommendations and are not mandatory. Your choice will not affect the review process for your paper. Should you decide to embrace this policy, we strongly encourage you to archive empirical datasets on Zenodo or Dataverse, following Google guidelines to dataset providers, and share analysis scripts on freely accessible code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.  
 Self-Archiving  - ICSSP 2023 also encourages authors to self-archive a preprint of your accepted manuscript in arXiv.org or other similar open repositories. This is permitted by the ACM publisher. Note that the final version of the paper, as laid out by the publisher, cannot be self-archived. Instead, manuscripts with reviewer comments addressed must be used, but before applying the camera-ready instructions and templates.

 About ICSSP Conference Series  
 ICSSP 2023 is the 17th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.  
 Recent ICSSP conferences have mostly been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by ACM or IEEE. The 2021 and 2022 conferences were co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE), and ICSSP 2022 was co-sponsored and co-organized with the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. For the 2023 ICSSP, the ISSPA is pleased to be joining forces with representatives of CSRIO's Data61 unit, the data and digital specialist arm of Australia's national science agency.  
 About ICSSP 2023  
 In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.  
 The Call for Papers  is available. The Abstract deadline is 6 January 2023, and the Submission deadline is 13 January 2023.

  In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.  
  Topics of Interest

36. Conference ICTAC_3:
ICTAC  
 International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing  

 News and announcements 
  About ICTAC 
  Steering committee 
  Next event 
  Previous events 

 Aims and Objectives  
 The International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC) was founded in 2004. It takes place every year preferably in a developing country. The aim of the colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and government to present research results, and exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals, another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in research and education between participants and their institutions, from developing and industrial countries.  
 Program  
 The main conference normally lasts three days, but is typically enriched with a school and, possibly, tutorials. All should be welcome to the school, but it should be targetted specifically at (local) students and early career researchers, with courses presented by invited speakers before the main conference. The tutorials, if any, should be targeted at the conference participants and can be presented either by international or local invited speakers. In total, the technical programme should cover at least five days. The school itself can run for up to one week.  
 Proceedings  
 The proceedings of the conference are being published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series  .  
 Principles and Procedure  
 When organising an ICTAC edition, the following principles and procedure are followed:  
 The Steering Committee (SC) is responsible for appointing, for each event: | a. The General Chair(s), which is(are) responsible for the logistic and financial success of the event. They are also the main point of contact of the SC regarding any of these matters. We note, however that, the term "General Chair" does not have a universally accepted meaning, and the SC is happy for the General Chairs to adopt any title that best reflects their responsibilities, as explained above, in the community where the event takes place. Some examples of alternative terms are "Organisation Chair" or "Conference Chair". | b. The Programme Chair(s), which is(are) responsible for the success and quality of the event from an academic point of view. This should be done 18 months before the conference. 
  The conference general chairs appoint the local organization team and provide them with guidance concerning local organization and providing support in mobilizing local resources needed for the organization of the conference. The general chairs are primarily responsible for fund raising needed for the organization. They also play a role in ceremonial activities. 
  The program chairs are in charge of the academic activities of the conference, including the organization of the Program Committee (PC) and selecting Keynote Speakers, conducting the process of review and selection of papers, publication of the proceedings, and organization and implementation of the conference program (with help from the general chairs and local organization team). 
  The General and PC chairs, in agreement, decide and invite publicity chairs and workshop chairs if they see necessary. The nomination of a publicity chair is, in particular, strongly recommended. 
  There should be three or four keynote speakers and it is advisable to have about 35 PC members. 
  When drawing up lists of candidates for the PC and keynote speakers, the PC chairs should consult the general chairs, and they can also ask the SC to suggest candidates. 
  The lists of candidates for the PC and keynote speakers are to be communicated to the SC for final comments before invitations are sent. It is advisable to have six to eight candidates for keynote speakers for consideration by the SC. 
  All the above discussions and consultation should be completed, and the first Call for Papers circulated, within about 6 months. 
  It is suggested that PC members are encouraged to submit papers, but the PC chairs and conference chairs should not. 
  When making the conference budget, best efforts should be made to keep the registration fee as low as possible and yet to provide interesting social and cultural activities for the participants to enjoy. 
  The organisation of a special issue in a reputable journal is strongly encouraged. 
  Becoming an Organiser of ICTAC  
 Each conference attracts between 50 and 100 participants from all over the world. Every year, the Steering Committee issues a call for organisation and any group or institution wishing to host this event are invited to send their proposals. The priority is for the event to be located in a developing country. It usually combines a regular three-day scientific conference with related activities such as tutorials over another two-days and a summer school over the previous week. Innovation in the format and content is encouraged.  
 Proposals will be evaluated by the ICTAC Steering Committee.  
 Proposal Format and Submission   
 Proposals should be no more than four pages in length and should contain:  
 • Brief description of why the event is of interest to the proposer.  
 • Vision for the event, including its aims, the expected format and scale.  
 • An estimation of expected attendance, based, for example, on presence of a local community in the area and costs of travel to various parts of the world and local expenses.  
 • A description of the relevant qualifications and experience of the proposers, especially regarding conference organisation logistics.  
 • A description of the facilities that will be available for the event and to support the organisers.  
 • The contact information of the proposed organising committee.  
 The choice of a PC chair will be subject to later discussion with the Steering Committee and should not be part of the proposal.  
 The proposal (in PDF format) - and any inquiries from those who are from a developing country and willing to organising an ICTAC event or interested in helping organising such an event in a developing country - should be sent to Martin.Leucker@isp.uni-luebeck.de  .

  Call for Papers  
  
 The 13th International Conference on Information & Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD 2024), will be hosted in Nairobi, Kenya from December 9-11, 2024.  
 ICTD 2024 provides an international forum for scholarly researchers to explore the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in social, political, and economic development. The ICTD conferences have been taking place approximately every 18 months since 2006. Recent proceedings have been published in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Important Dates (Updated)  
 29 July 2024: Deadline for submission of Full Papers 
  31 August 2024 | 8 September 2024 | : Notification of acceptance for Full Papers (15 September: Reviews released) 
  22 September 2024 | 7 October 2024 | : Camera-ready deadline for Full Papers 
  All submissions are due 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).  
 Submission details are below. If you have any questions, please contact the Program Committee at ictdpc2024@gmail.com   
 Background  
 “ICTs” or “Information & Communication Technologies” comprise electronic technologies for information processing and communication, as well as systems, interventions, and platforms built on such technologies and the data generated by them. “Development” refers to a range of activities aimed at improving the lives of people, and includes, but is not restricted to poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, communication, gender equality, better governance, improved infrastructure, improved agricultural practices, environmental conservation, and sustainability. The conference program will reflect the multidisciplinary nature of ICTD research and diverse publishing traditions within this field, with anticipated contributions from disciplines including (but not limited to) anthropology, communication, computer science, economics, electrical engineering, data science, design, geography, human-computer interaction, information systems, political science, public health, sociology, and various methodological approaches. Given the character of the conference, papers must address and appeal to a broad multidisciplinary audience.  
 Call for Full Papers  
 To be considered Full Papers, contributions | should be more than six pages long | (single column ACM template, as specified in the “Submission Instructions” section below). There is no hard page limit, but papers with length incommensurate to contributions will be rejected. Previous papers (if converted to the ACM single-column format) would have run 14-18 pages in length. 
  Accepted papers typically represent a major advance for the field of ICTD and will be presented as oral presentations. 
  Full Papers will be evaluated via double-blind peer review by a multidisciplinary panel of at least three readers, one of whom will come from outside the paper’s disciplinary domain in order to ensure broad readability. Reviewers will have 4 weeks to complete their reviews. 
  Full Papers will be evaluated according to their novel research contribution, methodological soundness, theoretical framing and reference to related work, quality of analysis, quality of writing and presentation, and relevance to a broad audience of researchers. Manuscripts considering novel designs, new technologies, project assessments, policy analyses, impact studies, theoretical contributions, social issues around ICT and development, and so forth will be considered. Well-analysed negative results from which generalizable conclusions can be drawn are also sought. Authors are encouraged to address the diversity of approaches in ICTD research by providing context, implications, and actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners beyond the authors’ primary domains. Full Papers typically present mature work whereas Notes (TBA) are used for presenting preliminary research that is still work-in-progress. 
  All acceptance will be conditional , the final version of the paper will be checked by reviewers before final acceptance. 
  All accepted Full Papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. A subset of the Full Papers will also appear in a special issue of the Information Technologies & International Development journal. 
  Submission Instructions  
 Submission should be done via the link: | https://ictd2024.hotcrp.com/ 
  Only original, unpublished, research papers in English will be considered. 
  Full Papers | must use | the | ACM templates | and reference formatting (LaTex and Word available). Please, note: As described in the page linked above, manuscripts for review should be submitted in a single column format. Manuscripts submitted for review should use the “Submission Template” (Microsoft Word) or “Primary Article Template” (Latex -documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} ) as described at the link. 
  Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review. No author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Only blind the reference itself in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy. 
  Submissions not in the template format, not related to the conference themes, not anonymized, and/or not meeting a minimum bar of academic research writing will be rejected without full review. 
  Upon acceptance, you will receive instructions on how to prepare your paper for publication. 
  For each accepted submission, at least one of the authors will be required to register and present it at ICTD2024. Else, the submission will not be published in the final proceedings. 
  For Full Papers, see the ACM’s | copyright policies and options | . 
  Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model | ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program  and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance  . 
  Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows: | Full details of the new ICPS publishing model: | https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq 
  Full details of the ACM Open program: | https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess 
  Please direct all questions about the new model to icps-info@acm.org  . 
  Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to read and follow the community-defined minimum ethical standards for ICTD research  . These standards are the result of a three-year participatory process to co-define ethical standards in ICTD, and were voted on and adopted at the ICTD conference in Ahmedabad in January 2019. You can also read more about how these standards were created  .  
 In addition, submissions that describe experiments with human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects, or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a paper raises significant ethical concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.

The INTERSCIENCE Institute-of Management and Technology (IIMT) provide conference support. Information and Communication Technology have a profound influence on how modern organizations operate. Information Technology supports various organizations for their decision making. New technologies are constantly emerging, which are enabling applications in various domains and services. Information Technology is no longer a functional area within an organization, but is integral to the functioning of an organization. In the recent time, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is probably the single most important facilitator of the integration process. The strong influence of Information and Communication Technology in shaping the process of globalization, particularly in the productive, commercial and financial spheres, is also widely recognized. Creating economic opportunities and contributing to poverty reduction is another thrust area for the emerging epoch of ICT.   
   
 Like every year, 14th International Conference of Information and Communication Technology (ICTech-2025) shall provide a forum for presentation of new research results and demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information technology and management. The conference aims to bring together developers, users, academicians and researchers in the information technology and business community for sharing and exploring new areas of research and development and to discuss emerging issues facing business organizations in the knowledge economy.

 International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR)  
  
 The International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR) is the premier conference of theoretical information retrieval, co-located each year with the SIGIR conference.  
 The Scope of ICTIR   
 ICTIR welcomes submissions that discuss or utilise theoretical aspects of information retrieval, as well as interdisciplinary research that connects information retrieval with other research disciplines that are theoretically motivated. Other research disciplines include, but are not limited to: artificial intelligence, cognitive science, digital humanities, machine learning, natural language processing, recommendation, and social computing.  
 While IR research traditionally relies heavily on rigorous experimentation, ICTIR does not see this as a must. That is, lack of experiments is not considered a weakness in an ICTIR submission. However, if the work is theoretically driven, it should be presented so that it is accessible to a wide audience in the IR community, and the theory should be accompanied by good justifications and arguments.  
 ICTIR does welcome experiment-based papers, but the experimental results are expected to shed some light on the theoretical aspects of IR and related fields.  
 Specific topics that are particularly welcome are decided by the ICTIR PC chairs each year.

 introduction  
   
 Digital technology affects the lives of people the world over in many ways. ICT are a key factor not only at the macro level in the process of globalization but also at the micro level where the increased use of mobile phones, for instance, has changed communication patterns all over the world. In order to alleviate and to promote Indian ICT industry, the Government of India had set up a National Task Force on ICT and Software Development to examine the feasibility of strengthening the industry along with providing major fiscal incentives. India aims to transform India into a truly developed and empowered society by 2025. However, to achieve this growth, the sector has to continue to re-invent itself and strive for that extra mile, through new business models, global delivery, partnerships and transformation. In order to recognize and reward the extraordinary performance as well achievements by ICT and allied industries, Communally we are organising 9th Edition of ICT4SD International ICT summit & Awards 2025 on 3  - 5  July, 2025 at Goa, India.

 Call for Full Papers   
 The European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.   
 Topics of Interest   
 ECIR 2025 invites the submission of high-quality and original papers in the broad field of Information Retrieval – this primarily includes textual or textual with multimodal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:   
 Search and ranking, | including retrieval models and ranking, query and content analysis, web search, and theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval; 
  User aspects in IR | , including information interaction, contextualisation, personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours; 
  System aspects | , including retrieval and recommendation architectures, efficiency and scalability; 
  Conversational search and recommender systems | , focusing on natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, multimodal interaction, and user engagement in search processes; 
  Explainability methods | , addressing the transparency, interpretability, and accountability of AI-driven systems, particularly for information retrieval, recommendation, and personalisation; 
  Machine Learning and Large Language Models | for information retrieval and recommendation; 
  Applications | , such as web search, recommender systems, web and social media apps, professional and domain-specific search, novel interfaces to search tools, intelligent search, and conversational agents; 
  Evaluation research | , including new metrics and novel methods for the measurement and evaluation of retrieval and/or recommendation systems, users, and/or applications; 
  New social and technical challenges in IR | , such as bias, ethics, fake news, and hate speech, IR-focused trustworthy & explainable AI methodologies and techniques. 
  Full Paper Track   
 The Full Paper Track provides the opportunity for researchers to present their state-of-the-art research in Information Retrieval, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.   
 Full papers are up to | 12 pages in length | plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the page limit. Please put appendices | before | the references for paper submission. 
  Full papers will be refereed through | double-blind peer review | , with an initial first-stage review followed by a second stage of discussion led by a meta-reviewer. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word (to be found at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   ), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers (  https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid   ).   
 All submissions must be written in English. All papers should be submitted electronically through the EasyChair submission system (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025   )   
 In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the paper has been submitted, changes relating to its authorship cannot be made.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the conference. Accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of the authors in person – and at least one author for each accepted contribution will be required to register and attend.   
 Dual Submission Policy   
 Papers submitted to ECIR 2025 should be substantially different from papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are under review at other venues. Exceptions to this rule are:   
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings. 
  Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (e.g., in institutional archives or preprint archives like arXiv). However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit it to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. If your paper already is available as a technical report, you might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed back). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and Professional Conduct   
 ECIR 2025 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organising committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism in our community, namely:   
 The | ACM’s Policy on Authorship | , 
  The | ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy Against Harassment | .
