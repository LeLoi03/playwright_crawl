 Welcome to the main web site of The International Symposium on DIStributed Computing (DISC)   .  
 DISC is an international symposium on the theory, design, analysis, implementation and application of distributed systems and networks. DISC is organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS)   .  
 The symposium was established in 1985 as a biannual International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs (WDAG). The scope was soon extended to cover all aspects of distributed algorithms as WDAG came to stand for International Workshop on Distributed AlGorithms, and in 1989 it became an annual symposium. To reflect the expansion of its area of interest, the name was changed to DISC (International Symposium on DIStributed Computing) in 1998. The name change also reflects the opening of the symposium to all aspects of distributed computing. The aim of DISC is to reflect the exciting and rapid developments in this field.  
 This site was created for archiving information about all WDAGs and DISCs, organized since 1985.  
 DISC 2024  will be held in Madrid, Spain on October 28 – November 1, 2024.

 Camera-Ready Completion Deadline | 22 April 2025 
 DIS 2025 Conference | 5-9 of July 2025 

  Deadlines specified as Anywhere on Earth  time   DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors must present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 Conference  Theme  
 In a time of unprecedented global change, DIS 2025 focuses on designing for sustainability, urging us to rethink our relationship with the planet and its environments and oceans. As designers and researchers, we face the challenges of navigating through these uncertain times, but the inherent disruption the coming changes entail also offers us an opportunity to recalibrate and retarget our approaches toward achieving a more sustainable future. Leaning into these ideas, the theme of DIS 2025 encourages us to explore alternative approaches that move beyond human-centered design, emphasizing the importance of ecological systems and our interconnectedness with all forms of life. By rethinking the boundaries between humans, non-humans, technology, and nature, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable and symbiotic future.  
 DIS’25 welcomes work addressing the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense. In addition, we particularly encourage submissions that address the DIS’25 conference theme.  
 Contribution Areas  
 DIS 2025 includes the following five contribution areas for submissions: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design. We particularly encourage submissions that address one of these five contribution areas, each described in further detail below:  
 Critical Computing and Design Theory  
 This area invites papers on the topics of critical computing, design theory and their overlap. Critical computing encompasses the reimagination as well as analysis and critique of technologies in the world—i.e., the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of computing and the interactive systems we create. Design theory encompasses knowledge around critical-reflective design and research practice. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches, spanning disciplines, theories, and methods, including those that question or confront technological progress. The area seeks papers that explore and expand the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, pragmatism, and craftsmanship.  
 Design Methods and Processes  
 This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design across industry, academia, and the public sector. We are particularly interested in methodological contributions that push the boundaries of current practice, exploring new scales, audiences, and contexts for design. This includes innovative methods that enable designers to address complex, multi-layered problems, engage with underrepresented or hard-to-reach communities, and adapt to diverse, evolving technological landscapes.  
 Artifacts and Systems  
 This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems across a wide range of materials, fabrication methods, and technologies. We encourage papers that expand our understanding of meaningful interactions (including but not limited to sensing and actuation) and how they can be designed to support more sustainable, equitable, and resilient outcomes. We especially call for projects that engage with the experience of the material, temporal, and spatial aspects of designing objects, systems, and spaces.  
 Research Through Design (RtD)  
 The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces. Core to this area is an iterative, hands-on engagement, where design probes act as lenses for uncovering new insights and implications in a wide variety of design research processes.  
 AI and Design  
 This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence. We hope to receive papers on design for AI (making AI things), design with AI (using AI to help or automate design), design of agents and robots (such as their social presence), responsible AI, and design AI and its regulations. Contributions may include resources, methods, and tools for design; AI artifacts and systems; first-person experiences of designing with or for AI; conceptual frameworks for combining design knowledge and AI; empirical studies with a sensitivity for human needs and AI capabilities. Many papers that authors consider submitting to this subcommittee will also be a match to one of the other subcommittees. As a guide, we suggest you submit papers to this subcommittee when the paper makes an equal contribution to Design and to AI or in cases where reviewers need a deep background in both design and AI.  
 Special Note on Broader Impact   
 At DIS 2025, all submissions will be assessed based on their broader impact on society and/or the environment. We encourage authors to address the positive and negative, actual and potential, and/or pragmatic significance of their work; that is, they should engage in substantive and reflective discussions of the impact of their research beyond a narrow intellectual contribution to the field.  
 Preparing Your Submissions  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, author list, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents by 13th January 2025. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three contribution areas that fit their submission paper. This content will be used to assign your paper to one of the subcommittees. It is not necessarily the case that your submission will be handled by a subcommittee that aligns with the contribution area you choose as a first preference. You can change the title and abstract as often as you like before the final submission deadline on 20 January 2025, but the author list and order must remain unchanged.  
  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID  ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID  from the start and has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all their published authors. ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Paper length and format  
 Papers do not have a page limit. Authors are instead encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. The length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words or below 4,000 words will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose, too short if they omit important details, neglect relevant prior art, or tamper with formatting rules to save on page count.  
 It is important that your submission is formatted correctly. Incorrectly formatted submissions might be rejected. Full online guidance is available from the ACM: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions   
 Templates are available for several platforms:  
 Microsoft Word 
  LaTeX | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf (Latex) | (or search for | ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article | ) 
  First, authors prepare their manuscript in the designated single-column format in PDF using LaTeX or Microsoft Word. LaTeX users should use \documentclass[manuscript, review]{acmart}. For an anonymous submission, use \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} to automatically replace the authors for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. The authors then submit the PDF and the source files via PCS  . Reviewers will review the papers in the single-column format.  
 Upon conditional acceptance of an article, authors revise the manuscript and submit publication-ready source files to PCS  . The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS: https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow

 Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Submission  
 ACM publications are reviewed and read by many people. Making your paper accessible will help to promote the equal participation of people with disabilities. This section describes how to check if your PDF is accessible and how to fix the most common accessibility problems. For more information please refer to Adobe’s accessibility resource center.  
 How do I test if my PDF is accessible?  
 The document should be tagged. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Description’ tab. Look for ‘Tagged PDF: Yes’ among the set of advanced properties. If you do not have access to Adobe Acrobat, try selecting some text in the PDF and pasting it into a text editor. If you can’t do this, or the text looks wrong, chances are your document is not readable with a screen reader.  
 Check the accessibility. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. ‘Accessibility’. ‘Full Check’. The checker will report accessibility problems.  
 Fonts should be embedded, or your PDF will need to be regenerated, and you may lose the accessibility that you have added. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Fonts’ tab. All of the fonts should have the word ’embedded’ in parentheses after the font name (unless they are not visible in the final document).  
 How do I fix accessibility problems?  
 Word users should correct as many problems as possible in the Word source file rather than the PDF, as described in the next section. On a PC, the Adobe plugin for Word can export accessibility features from the Word document into the PDF.  
 On a Mac, this is not the case. Those using Word on a Mac, and all LaTeX users will need to edit the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat. A better basic PDF may be produced by using latex2pdf as opposed to ps2pdf. See also the WebAim PDF Accessibility primer [ http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/resources.html  ], which provides information for OpenOffice users.  
 The accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro provides help with fixing many accessibility problems. The following steps are for Adobe Acrobat Pro 9. For more detailed instructions for Adobe Acrobat Pro XI see the Accessible PDF guidelines. You can also find more information on Adobe’s accessibility resources page  
 Add tags. | Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. Select ‘Accessibility’, then ‘Add tags to document’. 
  Add alternative text for figures. | Context-click the Figure, select ‘Properties’, and fill in ‘Alternate Text’. If no ‘Properties’ option appears, go to the ‘Advanced’ menu, select ‘Touch Up Reading Order’, and then try context-clicking on the figures again, looking for an ‘Edit alternate text’ option. 
  Specify the document language. | Go to the ‘File’ menu. Select ‘Properties’, then the ‘Advanced’ tab, ‘Language’ field. In some versions of Acrobat, the ‘Properties’ option is called ‘Document Properties’. In some versions, the ‘Language’ field is in a ‘Reading Options’ tab. 
  Define tab order. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Pages’. 
  Click on any page, then type Ctrl-A (or Command-A on a Mac) to select all the pages. 
  Go to the ‘Options’ menu in the top right of the dialogue box (icon showing two cogs), and select ‘Page Properties’. 
  In the ‘Tab Order’ tab, select ‘Use document structure’. 
  Make sure tables have headings. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Tags’. 
  Select the ‘Tags’ tab. This panel shows the document structure as a tree. 
  Navigate to the table cells that should be headers. 
  Check they have the type <TH>. If not, then right-click on the header cell, select ‘properties’, select the ‘Tag’ tab, and change the value for ‘Type’ to ‘Table Header Cell’. 
  Creating an accessible PDF directly from Word  
 The following link provides step-by-step instructions for adding basic accessibility information to a Word document on a PC, then exporting it to a PDF document intended for ACM: Create an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word   
 These guidelines were adopted from ASSETS 2020.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All submissions must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgments section that reveals the authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the submission is left to the authors’ discretion. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Review Process  
 After the submission deadline, each paper will be assigned to a split committee during the PCS submission process in consultation with SCs, and at the discretion of the technical program chairs. The DIS 2025 paper committees will be composed of Associate Chairs that collectively represent expertise across all contribution types. The process will be similar to the DIS 2024 conference and is intended to foster discussion across contribution types and also ensure equitable workload across ACs.  
 SCs will then assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC (who will be blind wrt the authors’ identity) will each write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. As part of this process, we will strive to find ACs and reviewers who are experts in the topic area of each submission. We also highly encourage all authors to sign up and volunteer to be reviewers.  
 After the reviews have been written, the 1AC for a paper will examine the paper and review content, trigger discussions among the review panel if required, and write a meta-review of the paper that summarizes the three submitted reviews. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they will be required to write a review as well as a meta-review; we will strive to distinguish between the 1AC’s assessment of the submission and the summarisation of the other reviews.  
 The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper’s acceptance or rejection to the SC responsible for that submission. SCs and ACs will meet at a virtual program committee meeting with the technical program chairs to discuss the final acceptance of papers for inclusion in the program  
 Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of Designing Interactive Systems 2025 and will become available in ACM Digital Library.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their paper on or before the notification date of 8th April 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera-ready submission” and submitted to PCS by the deadline of 22nd April 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.  
 Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permission to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (paper/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Responsibility for obtaining permission to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference. All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access, or institutional enrollment in the ACM Open  program. More information on rights management can be found here: https://authors.acm.org/  . Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors may be asked to opt-in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference.  
 Accepted submissions will also be asked to prepare and submit a short teaser video (approximately one minute) to promote contributions at the conference and to share the work with the broader community.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid unless the person presenting the paper or pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published papers will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 Scope    

 The 45 th  IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss and exchange cutting edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over July 20-23 rd  , 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.  

 Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:  

  Cloud Computing 

  Distributed Algorithms 

  Big Data, Models & Systems 

  Distributed Fault Tolerance 

  Distributed OS and Middleware 

  Edge Computing 

  IoT + CPS 

  Mobile Computing 

  Security, Privacy and Trust 

  Blockchains/Databases 

  Distributed Systems for AI/ML 

  AI/ML for Distributed Systems 

  Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures 

 Paper Submission   

 The Paper strand provides  the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.  

 Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector https://template-selector.ieee.org/  ). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages  (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.  

 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.  

 For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.  

 Note that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics  and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.   

 Note  : A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)  . The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

 Important Dates  
  
 Submission Site opens | 3 January 2025 
 Title and Abstract deadline | 13 January 2025 
 Paper and Pictorial Submission deadline | 20 January 2025 
 Notifications | 8 April 2025 
 Camera-Ready Completion Deadline | 22 April 2025 
 DIS 2025 Conference | 5-9 of July 2025 

  Deadlines specified as Anywhere on Earth  time   DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors must present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 Conference  Theme  
 In a time of unprecedented global change, DIS 2025 focuses on designing for sustainability, urging us to rethink our relationship with the planet and its environments and oceans. As designers and researchers, we face the challenges of navigating through these uncertain times, but the inherent disruption the coming changes entail also offers us an opportunity to recalibrate and retarget our approaches toward achieving a more sustainable future. Leaning into these ideas, the theme of DIS 2025 encourages us to explore alternative approaches that move beyond human-centered design, emphasizing the importance of ecological systems and our interconnectedness with all forms of life. By rethinking the boundaries between humans, non-humans, technology, and nature, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable and symbiotic future.  
 DIS’25 welcomes work addressing the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense. In addition, we particularly encourage submissions that address the DIS’25 conference theme.  
 Contribution Areas  
 DIS 2025 includes the following five contribution areas for submissions: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design. We particularly encourage submissions that address one of these five contribution areas, each described in further detail below:  
 Critical Computing and Design Theory  
 This area invites papers on the topics of critical computing, design theory and their overlap. Critical computing encompasses the reimagination as well as analysis and critique of technologies in the world—i.e., the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of computing and the interactive systems we create. Design theory encompasses knowledge around critical-reflective design and research practice. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches, spanning disciplines, theories, and methods, including those that question or confront technological progress. The area seeks papers that explore and expand the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, pragmatism, and craftsmanship.  
 Design Methods and Processes  
 This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design across industry, academia, and the public sector. We are particularly interested in methodological contributions that push the boundaries of current practice, exploring new scales, audiences, and contexts for design. This includes innovative methods that enable designers to address complex, multi-layered problems, engage with underrepresented or hard-to-reach communities, and adapt to diverse, evolving technological landscapes.  
 Artifacts and Systems  
 This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems across a wide range of materials, fabrication methods, and technologies. We encourage papers that expand our understanding of meaningful interactions (including but not limited to sensing and actuation) and how they can be designed to support more sustainable, equitable, and resilient outcomes. We especially call for projects that engage with the experience of the material, temporal, and spatial aspects of designing objects, systems, and spaces.  
 Research Through Design (RtD)  
 The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces. Core to this area is an iterative, hands-on engagement, where design probes act as lenses for uncovering new insights and implications in a wide variety of design research processes.  
 AI and Design  
 This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence. We hope to receive papers on design for AI (making AI things), design with AI (using AI to help or automate design), design of agents and robots (such as their social presence), responsible AI, and design AI and its regulations. Contributions may include resources, methods, and tools for design; AI artifacts and systems; first-person experiences of designing with or for AI; conceptual frameworks for combining design knowledge and AI; empirical studies with a sensitivity for human needs and AI capabilities. Many papers that authors consider submitting to this subcommittee will also be a match to one of the other subcommittees. As a guide, we suggest you submit papers to this subcommittee when the paper makes an equal contribution to Design and to AI or in cases where reviewers need a deep background in both design and AI.  
 Special Note on Broader Impact   
 At DIS 2025, all submissions will be assessed based on their broader impact on society and/or the environment. We encourage authors to address the positive and negative, actual and potential, and/or pragmatic significance of their work; that is, they should engage in substantive and reflective discussions of the impact of their research beyond a narrow intellectual contribution to the field.  
 Preparing Your Submissions  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, author list, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents by 13th January 2025. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three contribution areas that fit their submission paper. This content will be used to assign your paper to one of the subcommittees. It is not necessarily the case that your submission will be handled by a subcommittee that aligns with the contribution area you choose as a first preference. You can change the title and abstract as often as you like before the final submission deadline on 20 January 2025, but the author list and order must remain unchanged.  
  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID  ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID  from the start and has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all their published authors. ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Paper length and format  
 Papers do not have a page limit. Authors are instead encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. The length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words or below 4,000 words will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose, too short if they omit important details, neglect relevant prior art, or tamper with formatting rules to save on page count.  
 It is important that your submission is formatted correctly. Incorrectly formatted submissions might be rejected. Full online guidance is available from the ACM: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions   
 Templates are available for several platforms:  
 Microsoft Word 
  LaTeX | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf (Latex) | (or search for | ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article | ) 
  First, authors prepare their manuscript in the designated single-column format in PDF using LaTeX or Microsoft Word. LaTeX users should use \documentclass[manuscript, review]{acmart}. For an anonymous submission, use \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} to automatically replace the authors for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. The authors then submit the PDF and the source files via PCS  . Reviewers will review the papers in the single-column format.  
 Upon conditional acceptance of an article, authors revise the manuscript and submit publication-ready source files to PCS  . The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS: https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow

 Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Submission  
 ACM publications are reviewed and read by many people. Making your paper accessible will help to promote the equal participation of people with disabilities. This section describes how to check if your PDF is accessible and how to fix the most common accessibility problems. For more information please refer to Adobe’s accessibility resource center.  
 How do I test if my PDF is accessible?  
 The document should be tagged. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Description’ tab. Look for ‘Tagged PDF: Yes’ among the set of advanced properties. If you do not have access to Adobe Acrobat, try selecting some text in the PDF and pasting it into a text editor. If you can’t do this, or the text looks wrong, chances are your document is not readable with a screen reader.  
 Check the accessibility. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. ‘Accessibility’. ‘Full Check’. The checker will report accessibility problems.  
 Fonts should be embedded, or your PDF will need to be regenerated, and you may lose the accessibility that you have added. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Fonts’ tab. All of the fonts should have the word ’embedded’ in parentheses after the font name (unless they are not visible in the final document).  
 How do I fix accessibility problems?  
 Word users should correct as many problems as possible in the Word source file rather than the PDF, as described in the next section. On a PC, the Adobe plugin for Word can export accessibility features from the Word document into the PDF.  
 On a Mac, this is not the case. Those using Word on a Mac, and all LaTeX users will need to edit the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat. A better basic PDF may be produced by using latex2pdf as opposed to ps2pdf. See also the WebAim PDF Accessibility primer [ http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/resources.html  ], which provides information for OpenOffice users.  
 The accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro provides help with fixing many accessibility problems. The following steps are for Adobe Acrobat Pro 9. For more detailed instructions for Adobe Acrobat Pro XI see the Accessible PDF guidelines. You can also find more information on Adobe’s accessibility resources page  
 Add tags. | Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. Select ‘Accessibility’, then ‘Add tags to document’. 
  Add alternative text for figures. | Context-click the Figure, select ‘Properties’, and fill in ‘Alternate Text’. If no ‘Properties’ option appears, go to the ‘Advanced’ menu, select ‘Touch Up Reading Order’, and then try context-clicking on the figures again, looking for an ‘Edit alternate text’ option. 
  Specify the document language. | Go to the ‘File’ menu. Select ‘Properties’, then the ‘Advanced’ tab, ‘Language’ field. In some versions of Acrobat, the ‘Properties’ option is called ‘Document Properties’. In some versions, the ‘Language’ field is in a ‘Reading Options’ tab. 
  Define tab order. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Pages’. 
  Click on any page, then type Ctrl-A (or Command-A on a Mac) to select all the pages. 
  Go to the ‘Options’ menu in the top right of the dialogue box (icon showing two cogs), and select ‘Page Properties’. 
  In the ‘Tab Order’ tab, select ‘Use document structure’. 
  Make sure tables have headings. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Tags’. 
  Select the ‘Tags’ tab. This panel shows the document structure as a tree. 
  Navigate to the table cells that should be headers. 
  Check they have the type <TH>. If not, then right-click on the header cell, select ‘properties’, select the ‘Tag’ tab, and change the value for ‘Type’ to ‘Table Header Cell’. 
  Creating an accessible PDF directly from Word  
 The following link provides step-by-step instructions for adding basic accessibility information to a Word document on a PC, then exporting it to a PDF document intended for ACM: Create an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word   
 These guidelines were adopted from ASSETS 2020.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All submissions must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgments section that reveals the authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the submission is left to the authors’ discretion. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Review Process  
 After the submission deadline, each paper will be assigned to a split committee during the PCS submission process in consultation with SCs, and at the discretion of the technical program chairs. The DIS 2025 paper committees will be composed of Associate Chairs that collectively represent expertise across all contribution types. The process will be similar to the DIS 2024 conference and is intended to foster discussion across contribution types and also ensure equitable workload across ACs.  
 SCs will then assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC (who will be blind wrt the authors’ identity) will each write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. As part of this process, we will strive to find ACs and reviewers who are experts in the topic area of each submission. We also highly encourage all authors to sign up and volunteer to be reviewers.  
 After the reviews have been written, the 1AC for a paper will examine the paper and review content, trigger discussions among the review panel if required, and write a meta-review of the paper that summarizes the three submitted reviews. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they will be required to write a review as well as a meta-review; we will strive to distinguish between the 1AC’s assessment of the submission and the summarisation of the other reviews.  
 The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper’s acceptance or rejection to the SC responsible for that submission. SCs and ACs will meet at a virtual program committee meeting with the technical program chairs to discuss the final acceptance of papers for inclusion in the program  
 Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of Designing Interactive Systems 2025 and will become available in ACM Digital Library.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their paper on or before the notification date of 8th April 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera-ready submission” and submitted to PCS by the deadline of 22nd April 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.  
 Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permission to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (paper/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Responsibility for obtaining permission to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference. All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access, or institutional enrollment in the ACM Open  program. More information on rights management can be found here: https://authors.acm.org/  . Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors may be asked to opt-in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference.  
 Accepted submissions will also be asked to prepare and submit a short teaser video (approximately one minute) to promote contributions at the conference and to share the work with the broader community.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid unless the person presenting the paper or pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published papers will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 Camera-Ready Completion Deadline | 22 April 2025 
 DIS 2025 Conference | 5-9 of July 2025 

  Deadlines specified as Anywhere on Earth  time   DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors must present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 Conference  Theme  
 In a time of unprecedented global change, DIS 2025 focuses on designing for sustainability, urging us to rethink our relationship with the planet and its environments and oceans. As designers and researchers, we face the challenges of navigating through these uncertain times, but the inherent disruption the coming changes entail also offers us an opportunity to recalibrate and retarget our approaches toward achieving a more sustainable future. Leaning into these ideas, the theme of DIS 2025 encourages us to explore alternative approaches that move beyond human-centered design, emphasizing the importance of ecological systems and our interconnectedness with all forms of life. By rethinking the boundaries between humans, non-humans, technology, and nature, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable and symbiotic future.  
 DIS’25 welcomes work addressing the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense. In addition, we particularly encourage submissions that address the DIS’25 conference theme.  
 Contribution Areas  
 DIS 2025 includes the following five contribution areas for submissions: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design. We particularly encourage submissions that address one of these five contribution areas, each described in further detail below:  
 Critical Computing and Design Theory  
 This area invites papers on the topics of critical computing, design theory and their overlap. Critical computing encompasses the reimagination as well as analysis and critique of technologies in the world—i.e., the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of computing and the interactive systems we create. Design theory encompasses knowledge around critical-reflective design and research practice. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches, spanning disciplines, theories, and methods, including those that question or confront technological progress. The area seeks papers that explore and expand the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, pragmatism, and craftsmanship.  
 Design Methods and Processes  
 This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design across industry, academia, and the public sector. We are particularly interested in methodological contributions that push the boundaries of current practice, exploring new scales, audiences, and contexts for design. This includes innovative methods that enable designers to address complex, multi-layered problems, engage with underrepresented or hard-to-reach communities, and adapt to diverse, evolving technological landscapes.  
 Artifacts and Systems  
 This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems across a wide range of materials, fabrication methods, and technologies. We encourage papers that expand our understanding of meaningful interactions (including but not limited to sensing and actuation) and how they can be designed to support more sustainable, equitable, and resilient outcomes. We especially call for projects that engage with the experience of the material, temporal, and spatial aspects of designing objects, systems, and spaces.  
 Research Through Design (RtD)  
 The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces. Core to this area is an iterative, hands-on engagement, where design probes act as lenses for uncovering new insights and implications in a wide variety of design research processes.  
 AI and Design  
 This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence. We hope to receive papers on design for AI (making AI things), design with AI (using AI to help or automate design), design of agents and robots (such as their social presence), responsible AI, and design AI and its regulations. Contributions may include resources, methods, and tools for design; AI artifacts and systems; first-person experiences of designing with or for AI; conceptual frameworks for combining design knowledge and AI; empirical studies with a sensitivity for human needs and AI capabilities. Many papers that authors consider submitting to this subcommittee will also be a match to one of the other subcommittees. As a guide, we suggest you submit papers to this subcommittee when the paper makes an equal contribution to Design and to AI or in cases where reviewers need a deep background in both design and AI.  
 Special Note on Broader Impact   
 At DIS 2025, all submissions will be assessed based on their broader impact on society and/or the environment. We encourage authors to address the positive and negative, actual and potential, and/or pragmatic significance of their work; that is, they should engage in substantive and reflective discussions of the impact of their research beyond a narrow intellectual contribution to the field.  
 Preparing Your Submissions  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, author list, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents by 13th January 2025. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three contribution areas that fit their submission paper. This content will be used to assign your paper to one of the subcommittees. It is not necessarily the case that your submission will be handled by a subcommittee that aligns with the contribution area you choose as a first preference. You can change the title and abstract as often as you like before the final submission deadline on 20 January 2025, but the author list and order must remain unchanged.  
  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID  ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID  from the start and has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all their published authors. ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Paper length and format  
 Papers do not have a page limit. Authors are instead encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. The length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words or below 4,000 words will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose, too short if they omit important details, neglect relevant prior art, or tamper with formatting rules to save on page count.  
 It is important that your submission is formatted correctly. Incorrectly formatted submissions might be rejected. Full online guidance is available from the ACM: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions   
 Templates are available for several platforms:  
 Microsoft Word 
  LaTeX | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf (Latex) | (or search for | ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article | ) 
  First, authors prepare their manuscript in the designated single-column format in PDF using LaTeX or Microsoft Word. LaTeX users should use \documentclass[manuscript, review]{acmart}. For an anonymous submission, use \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} to automatically replace the authors for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. The authors then submit the PDF and the source files via PCS  . Reviewers will review the papers in the single-column format.  
 Upon conditional acceptance of an article, authors revise the manuscript and submit publication-ready source files to PCS  . The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS: https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow

 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid unless the person presenting the paper or pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published papers will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

  NB. DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors are required to present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 What are Pictorials?  
 Since their introduction at DIS 2014 in Vancouver, pictorials have become a first-class way of communicating design research. Pictorials are papers in which the visual components (e.g. diagrams, sketches, illustrations, renderings, photographs, annotated photographs, and collages) play a major role in conveying the ideas and contributions of a study in addition to the accompanying text. Pictorials leverage the power of visual communication with the effective use of visual languages and high-quality images. They may have a practical or theoretical nature or both. As design perspectives have increasingly become integrated in HCI practice and research, new approaches are needed to communicate design practices, processes, products and artifacts to the HCI community. Through Pictorials, researchers, practitioners, industry professionals, artists, designers, and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies and the arts are encouraged to express and unpack their design practices and projects in visually rich ways. The Pictorials format helps foster discussions among authors, conference attendees, and the wider community through the sharing of novel methods, insights and lessons learned from engaging in or with the design of interactive systems and artifacts.  
 Pictorials published at DIS2025 are ACM archival publications and will be made available through the ACM in the Digital Library. As with the papers track, they will be double-blind peer reviewed and will stand as the same quality of contribution as technical program papers. A good Pictorial requires precision and contextualization, but in terms of evidence and detail in argumentation, should aim at the level of a short paper rather than a full paper. However, Pictorials are not simply short papers. They work best when you need to show work that requires visual elements, like documentations of design processes, for example. Pictorials are a great form for reporting design work and natural to designers, who are sometimes rightfully skeptical about how much power words have in capturing design.  
 Pictorials are meant to contribute to knowledge in themselves rather than document concepts, methods, and processes, we already know. Visual components can be contributions to design knowledge in and of themselves, as a form of making, but they should also be accompanied by a narrative that helps the DIS/Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) audience understand what the knowledge contribution is. It is this scaffolding that transforms a Pictorial into research and guarantees that it can be treated as an argument in research discourse. At the same time, the textual narrative should be just that – a scaffolding to support the contribution of the visual content.  
 Like any good piece of research, the contribution must be made clear!   
 Preparing Your Pictorial  
 DIS 2025 has two submission deadlines for pictorials. The first deadline, January 13, 2025,  requires you to submit a title, abstract of less than 150 words, and meta-data including authors and keywords for your pictorial. This Notice of Intent (NOI) is an entry in PCS  . We will use this information to help plan the specifics of the review process. The second deadline, January 20, 2025  is for the final version of your pictorial. You can also update your previously submitted title, abstract and other metadata as needed.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Pictorial Formatting  
 Pictorials must be submitted using the DIS Pictorials templates (below) and not exceed 12 pages  , excluding references. On the first page of the submission please keep with the template and include the submission’s title, author(s) and their affiliation(s) (leave blank for double blind review), and a written abstract of no more than 150 words succinctly describing the background and context of the pictorial as well as its contribution to the DIS community. While the template’s first page contains only text, you can add images or other graphical content and otherwise use the space creatively like you would on the remaining pages. Further written parts known from other conference formats such as Introduction, Conclusion, Discussion, Acknowledgements, and References are optional. The main part of the submission should be an annotated visual composition and we encourage submissions to use the format creatively. Consider this review  of visual strategies in Pictorials for further inspiration.  
 PCS allows file sizes up to about 150 MB, but we suggest that you keep reviewers in mind and experiment with lower resolution to make the submission considerably smaller.  
 We strongly advise you to use the InDesign template to compose your Pictorial. If you do not have access to InDesign, please use the Word or Powerpoint templates.  
 DIS2022 | Pictorials InDesign Template 
  DIS2022 | Pictorials Word Template 
  DIS2022 | Pictorials Powerpoint Template 
  All submissions will be made through the New Precision Conference website. The total size of all submitted materials, including a video figure, should not exceed 150 MB.

  Creating an accessible PDF directly from InDesign or PowerPoint  
 Pictorial authors using InDesign, read this guide  to add alt text using InDesign and to generate an accessible PDF from InDesign. Follow these instructions  if you created your pictorial in PowerPoint. They are similar to creating accessible PDFs from Word by instructing users to run the accessibility checker and fixing errors in the source file (e.g., PowerPoint), and generating the PDF.  
 Consider this review  of alt-text patterns in Pictorials for further guidance.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All pictorials must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the pictorial.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the pictorial, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Please note that images need to be anonymised for review too, for example by blurring or covering parts that would reveal author or institutional identities (e.g., faces, logos, etc.).  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the pictorial is left to the authors’ discretion. We do expect that authors leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, DIS uses double-blind reviews, where external reviewers don’t know the identity of authors, and authors don’t know the identity of external reviewers. In the past few years, some authors have decided to publish their DIS submissions in public archives prior to or during the review process. These public archives have surpassed in reach and publicity what used to happen with tech reports published in institutional repositories. The consequence is that well-informed external reviewers may know, without searching for it, the full identity and institutional affiliation of the authors of a submission they are reviewing. While reviewers should not actively seek information about author identity, complete anonymization is difficult and can be made more so by publication and promotion of work during the DIS review process. While publication in public archives is becoming standard across many fields, authors should be aware that unconscious biases can affect the nature of reviews when identities are known. DIS does not discourage non-archival publication of work prior to or during the review process but recognizes that complete anonymization becomes more difficult in that context.  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the  2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Submission  
 You must submit your Notice of Intent (NOI) to submit a Pictorial to the Precision Conference submission system (PCS)  by January 13, 2025. The NOI is an entry in PCS with tentative author names, title and abstract. You can make changes as many times as you like before the final submission deadline on January 20, 2025. Note that this represents a compromise between the tight review schedule this year and the submission deadline being close to public holidays. There will be no further extensions!  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents. We encourage you to include your contribution type(s) in the metadata related to your submission.  
 Review Process  
 In DIS 2025, Pictorials follow a rigorous blind peer review process similar to Full Papers. The review process is managed by the Pictorials Chairs and the Pictorials Associate Chairs (ACs). Confidentiality of submissions is maintained throughout the review process. A list of the AC’s serving on the DIS2025 Pictorials Program Committee can be viewed on the Organisers Page.   
 Reviewers will use below questions to assess submissions. We provide them here for authors to consider before submitting their work.  
 Does the Pictorial make a contribution to DIS/HCI communities (and beyond) and state its contribution clearly? 
  Is the Pictorial well-situated, framed and well referenced within DIS and HCI especially, and outside of HCI where needed? (but please note: it is not necessary to reference everything about visual presentation that has ever been advanced by any discipline) 
  Are images/diagrams emphasized over text as the primary means of communicating the research contribution? 
  Does your work require and take advantage of the Pictorial format, or would it be clearer in a more text-based form? 
  Does the Pictorial represent a visual quality (image quality, layout, typography) high enough to convey the message of the submission in an engaging and effective way? 
  Does every visual component (image, diagram, picture etc.) used in the Pictorial play a meaningful role and clearly present the idea on its own or with the support of text? 
  Does the text and visual components of the pictorial support each other well in weaving the main argument/s of the pictorial? 
  Are the implications for HCI and/or interaction design clear? These may be analytic, generative, synthesis-oriented, and even manifestos. 
  Acceptance Rate, Relation to other Submissions, and Copyrighted Materials  
 Pictorials are expected to be original work created specifically for the pictorials track. Expect the track to be competitive and submit your best work. Expect an acceptance rate of around 20-25%.  
 Please do not submit work you have submitted elsewhere with a few images added. Doing so may violate dual submission rules. You may submit previously published work to which you have added significant visual content, provided only that such work is clearly and prominently attributed as such in a footnote to the title with a clear description of what the pictorial uniquely contributes or adds to the previous work. In this last case, at least 30% of the material must be new, per ACM rules.  
 You must be the author and copyright holder of all materials you submit, particularly all visual materials. Submitted work must comply with ACM policies, which state that you must be the owner of your images and/or obtain written approvals for included third-party materials. If authors are using third-party images as a key source for their pictorials, they should make a note to reviewers with their submission about their plans for obtaining copyright.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Pictorial  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their Pictorial on or before the notification date of April 8, 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the Pictorial prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera ready submission” into PCS  by the deadline of April 22, 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the Pictorial. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the Pictorial.  
 All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or licence to the ACM, or an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access. Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid, unless the person presenting the Pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published Pictorials will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted pictorials must be in attendance to present their pictorials and answer questions from the audience. Presenters of Papers and Pictorials will have a presentation slot of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Pictorials whose authors are not at the conference to present may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 Call for Papers  

   We are pleased to invite submissions for papers to the 2025 ACM SIGCHI Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS). We encourage all submissions that address one of our five contribution areas: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design.  

 Important Dates  
  
 Submission Site opens | 3 January 2025 
 Title and Abstract deadline | 13 January 2025 
 Paper and Pictorial Submission deadline | 20 January 2025 
 Notifications | 8 April 2025 
 Camera-Ready Completion Deadline | 22 April 2025 
 DIS 2025 Conference | 5-9 of July 2025 

  Deadlines specified as Anywhere on Earth  time   DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors must present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 Conference  Theme  
 In a time of unprecedented global change, DIS 2025 focuses on designing for sustainability, urging us to rethink our relationship with the planet and its environments and oceans. As designers and researchers, we face the challenges of navigating through these uncertain times, but the inherent disruption the coming changes entail also offers us an opportunity to recalibrate and retarget our approaches toward achieving a more sustainable future. Leaning into these ideas, the theme of DIS 2025 encourages us to explore alternative approaches that move beyond human-centered design, emphasizing the importance of ecological systems and our interconnectedness with all forms of life. By rethinking the boundaries between humans, non-humans, technology, and nature, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable and symbiotic future.  
 DIS’25 welcomes work addressing the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense. In addition, we particularly encourage submissions that address the DIS’25 conference theme.  
 Contribution Areas  
 DIS 2025 includes the following five contribution areas for submissions: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design. We particularly encourage submissions that address one of these five contribution areas, each described in further detail below:  
 Critical Computing and Design Theory  
 This area invites papers on the topics of critical computing, design theory and their overlap. Critical computing encompasses the reimagination as well as analysis and critique of technologies in the world—i.e., the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of computing and the interactive systems we create. Design theory encompasses knowledge around critical-reflective design and research practice. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches, spanning disciplines, theories, and methods, including those that question or confront technological progress. The area seeks papers that explore and expand the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, pragmatism, and craftsmanship.  
 Design Methods and Processes  
 This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design across industry, academia, and the public sector. We are particularly interested in methodological contributions that push the boundaries of current practice, exploring new scales, audiences, and contexts for design. This includes innovative methods that enable designers to address complex, multi-layered problems, engage with underrepresented or hard-to-reach communities, and adapt to diverse, evolving technological landscapes.  
 Artifacts and Systems  
 This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems across a wide range of materials, fabrication methods, and technologies. We encourage papers that expand our understanding of meaningful interactions (including but not limited to sensing and actuation) and how they can be designed to support more sustainable, equitable, and resilient outcomes. We especially call for projects that engage with the experience of the material, temporal, and spatial aspects of designing objects, systems, and spaces.  
 Research Through Design (RtD)  
 The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces. Core to this area is an iterative, hands-on engagement, where design probes act as lenses for uncovering new insights and implications in a wide variety of design research processes.  
 AI and Design  
 This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence. We hope to receive papers on design for AI (making AI things), design with AI (using AI to help or automate design), design of agents and robots (such as their social presence), responsible AI, and design AI and its regulations. Contributions may include resources, methods, and tools for design; AI artifacts and systems; first-person experiences of designing with or for AI; conceptual frameworks for combining design knowledge and AI; empirical studies with a sensitivity for human needs and AI capabilities. Many papers that authors consider submitting to this subcommittee will also be a match to one of the other subcommittees. As a guide, we suggest you submit papers to this subcommittee when the paper makes an equal contribution to Design and to AI or in cases where reviewers need a deep background in both design and AI.  
 Special Note on Broader Impact   
 At DIS 2025, all submissions will be assessed based on their broader impact on society and/or the environment. We encourage authors to address the positive and negative, actual and potential, and/or pragmatic significance of their work; that is, they should engage in substantive and reflective discussions of the impact of their research beyond a narrow intellectual contribution to the field.  
 Preparing Your Submissions  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, author list, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents by 13th January 2025. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three contribution areas that fit their submission paper. This content will be used to assign your paper to one of the subcommittees. It is not necessarily the case that your submission will be handled by a subcommittee that aligns with the contribution area you choose as a first preference. You can change the title and abstract as often as you like before the final submission deadline on 20 January 2025, but the author list and order must remain unchanged.  
  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID  ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID  from the start and has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all their published authors. ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Paper length and format  
 Papers do not have a page limit. Authors are instead encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. The length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words or below 4,000 words will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose, too short if they omit important details, neglect relevant prior art, or tamper with formatting rules to save on page count.  
 It is important that your submission is formatted correctly. Incorrectly formatted submissions might be rejected. Full online guidance is available from the ACM: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions   
 Templates are available for several platforms:  
 Microsoft Word 
  LaTeX | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf (Latex) | (or search for | ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article | ) 
  First, authors prepare their manuscript in the designated single-column format in PDF using LaTeX or Microsoft Word. LaTeX users should use \documentclass[manuscript, review]{acmart}. For an anonymous submission, use \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} to automatically replace the authors for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. The authors then submit the PDF and the source files via PCS  . Reviewers will review the papers in the single-column format.  
 Upon conditional acceptance of an article, authors revise the manuscript and submit publication-ready source files to PCS  . The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS: https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow

 Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Submission  
 ACM publications are reviewed and read by many people. Making your paper accessible will help to promote the equal participation of people with disabilities. This section describes how to check if your PDF is accessible and how to fix the most common accessibility problems. For more information please refer to Adobe’s accessibility resource center.  
 How do I test if my PDF is accessible?  
 The document should be tagged. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Description’ tab. Look for ‘Tagged PDF: Yes’ among the set of advanced properties. If you do not have access to Adobe Acrobat, try selecting some text in the PDF and pasting it into a text editor. If you can’t do this, or the text looks wrong, chances are your document is not readable with a screen reader.  
 Check the accessibility. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. ‘Accessibility’. ‘Full Check’. The checker will report accessibility problems.  
 Fonts should be embedded, or your PDF will need to be regenerated, and you may lose the accessibility that you have added. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Fonts’ tab. All of the fonts should have the word ’embedded’ in parentheses after the font name (unless they are not visible in the final document).  
 How do I fix accessibility problems?  
 Word users should correct as many problems as possible in the Word source file rather than the PDF, as described in the next section. On a PC, the Adobe plugin for Word can export accessibility features from the Word document into the PDF.  
 On a Mac, this is not the case. Those using Word on a Mac, and all LaTeX users will need to edit the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat. A better basic PDF may be produced by using latex2pdf as opposed to ps2pdf. See also the WebAim PDF Accessibility primer [ http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/resources.html  ], which provides information for OpenOffice users.  
 The accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro provides help with fixing many accessibility problems. The following steps are for Adobe Acrobat Pro 9. For more detailed instructions for Adobe Acrobat Pro XI see the Accessible PDF guidelines. You can also find more information on Adobe’s accessibility resources page  
 Add tags. | Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. Select ‘Accessibility’, then ‘Add tags to document’. 
  Add alternative text for figures. | Context-click the Figure, select ‘Properties’, and fill in ‘Alternate Text’. If no ‘Properties’ option appears, go to the ‘Advanced’ menu, select ‘Touch Up Reading Order’, and then try context-clicking on the figures again, looking for an ‘Edit alternate text’ option. 
  Specify the document language. | Go to the ‘File’ menu. Select ‘Properties’, then the ‘Advanced’ tab, ‘Language’ field. In some versions of Acrobat, the ‘Properties’ option is called ‘Document Properties’. In some versions, the ‘Language’ field is in a ‘Reading Options’ tab. 
  Define tab order. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Pages’. 
  Click on any page, then type Ctrl-A (or Command-A on a Mac) to select all the pages. 
  Go to the ‘Options’ menu in the top right of the dialogue box (icon showing two cogs), and select ‘Page Properties’. 
  In the ‘Tab Order’ tab, select ‘Use document structure’. 
  Make sure tables have headings. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Tags’. 
  Select the ‘Tags’ tab. This panel shows the document structure as a tree. 
  Navigate to the table cells that should be headers. 
  Check they have the type <TH>. If not, then right-click on the header cell, select ‘properties’, select the ‘Tag’ tab, and change the value for ‘Type’ to ‘Table Header Cell’. 
  Creating an accessible PDF directly from Word  
 The following link provides step-by-step instructions for adding basic accessibility information to a Word document on a PC, then exporting it to a PDF document intended for ACM: Create an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word   
 These guidelines were adopted from ASSETS 2020.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All submissions must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient).

Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgments section that reveals the authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the submission is left to the authors’ discretion. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Review Process  
 After the submission deadline, each paper will be assigned to a split committee during the PCS submission process in consultation with SCs, and at the discretion of the technical program chairs. The DIS 2025 paper committees will be composed of Associate Chairs that collectively represent expertise across all contribution types. The process will be similar to the DIS 2024 conference and is intended to foster discussion across contribution types and also ensure equitable workload across ACs.  
 SCs will then assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC (who will be blind wrt the authors’ identity) will each write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. As part of this process, we will strive to find ACs and reviewers who are experts in the topic area of each submission. We also highly encourage all authors to sign up and volunteer to be reviewers.  
 After the reviews have been written, the 1AC for a paper will examine the paper and review content, trigger discussions among the review panel if required, and write a meta-review of the paper that summarizes the three submitted reviews. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they will be required to write a review as well as a meta-review; we will strive to distinguish between the 1AC’s assessment of the submission and the summarisation of the other reviews.  
 The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper’s acceptance or rejection to the SC responsible for that submission. SCs and ACs will meet at a virtual program committee meeting with the technical program chairs to discuss the final acceptance of papers for inclusion in the program  
 Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of Designing Interactive Systems 2025 and will become available in ACM Digital Library.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their paper on or before the notification date of 8th April 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera-ready submission” and submitted to PCS by the deadline of 22nd April 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.  
 Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permission to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (paper/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Responsibility for obtaining permission to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference. All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access, or institutional enrollment in the ACM Open  program. More information on rights management can be found here: https://authors.acm.org/  . Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors may be asked to opt-in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference.  
 Accepted submissions will also be asked to prepare and submit a short teaser video (approximately one minute) to promote contributions at the conference and to share the work with the broader community.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid unless the person presenting the paper or pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published papers will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 Call for Papers  

   We are pleased to invite submissions for papers to the 2025 ACM SIGCHI Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS). We encourage all submissions that address one of our five contribution areas: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design.  

 Important Dates  
  
 Submission Site opens | 3 January 2025 
 Title and Abstract deadline | 13 January 2025 
 Paper and Pictorial Submission deadline | 20 January 2025 
 Notifications | 8 April 2025 
 Camera-Ready Completion Deadline | 22 April 2025 
 DIS 2025 Conference | 5-9 of July 2025 

  Deadlines specified as Anywhere on Earth  time   DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors must present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 Conference  Theme  
 In a time of unprecedented global change, DIS 2025 focuses on designing for sustainability, urging us to rethink our relationship with the planet and its environments and oceans. As designers and researchers, we face the challenges of navigating through these uncertain times, but the inherent disruption the coming changes entail also offers us an opportunity to recalibrate and retarget our approaches toward achieving a more sustainable future. Leaning into these ideas, the theme of DIS 2025 encourages us to explore alternative approaches that move beyond human-centered design, emphasizing the importance of ecological systems and our interconnectedness with all forms of life. By rethinking the boundaries between humans, non-humans, technology, and nature, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable and symbiotic future.  
 DIS’25 welcomes work addressing the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense. In addition, we particularly encourage submissions that address the DIS’25 conference theme.  
 Contribution Areas  
 DIS 2025 includes the following five contribution areas for submissions: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design. We particularly encourage submissions that address one of these five contribution areas, each described in further detail below:  
 Critical Computing and Design Theory  
 This area invites papers on the topics of critical computing, design theory and their overlap. Critical computing encompasses the reimagination as well as analysis and critique of technologies in the world—i.e., the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of computing and the interactive systems we create. Design theory encompasses knowledge around critical-reflective design and research practice. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches, spanning disciplines, theories, and methods, including those that question or confront technological progress. The area seeks papers that explore and expand the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, pragmatism, and craftsmanship.  
 Design Methods and Processes  
 This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design across industry, academia, and the public sector. We are particularly interested in methodological contributions that push the boundaries of current practice, exploring new scales, audiences, and contexts for design. This includes innovative methods that enable designers to address complex, multi-layered problems, engage with underrepresented or hard-to-reach communities, and adapt to diverse, evolving technological landscapes.  
 Artifacts and Systems  
 This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems across a wide range of materials, fabrication methods, and technologies. We encourage papers that expand our understanding of meaningful interactions (including but not limited to sensing and actuation) and how they can be designed to support more sustainable, equitable, and resilient outcomes. We especially call for projects that engage with the experience of the material, temporal, and spatial aspects of designing objects, systems, and spaces.  
 Research Through Design (RtD)  
 The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces. Core to this area is an iterative, hands-on engagement, where design probes act as lenses for uncovering new insights and implications in a wide variety of design research processes.  
 AI and Design  
 This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence. We hope to receive papers on design for AI (making AI things), design with AI (using AI to help or automate design), design of agents and robots (such as their social presence), responsible AI, and design AI and its regulations. Contributions may include resources, methods, and tools for design; AI artifacts and systems; first-person experiences of designing with or for AI; conceptual frameworks for combining design knowledge and AI; empirical studies with a sensitivity for human needs and AI capabilities. Many papers that authors consider submitting to this subcommittee will also be a match to one of the other subcommittees. As a guide, we suggest you submit papers to this subcommittee when the paper makes an equal contribution to Design and to AI or in cases where reviewers need a deep background in both design and AI.  
 Special Note on Broader Impact   
 At DIS 2025, all submissions will be assessed based on their broader impact on society and/or the environment. We encourage authors to address the positive and negative, actual and potential, and/or pragmatic significance of their work; that is, they should engage in substantive and reflective discussions of the impact of their research beyond a narrow intellectual contribution to the field.  
 Preparing Your Submissions  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, author list, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents by 13th January 2025. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three contribution areas that fit their submission paper. This content will be used to assign your paper to one of the subcommittees. It is not necessarily the case that your submission will be handled by a subcommittee that aligns with the contribution area you choose as a first preference. You can change the title and abstract as often as you like before the final submission deadline on 20 January 2025, but the author list and order must remain unchanged.  
  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID  ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID  from the start and has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all their published authors. ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Paper length and format  
 Papers do not have a page limit. Authors are instead encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. The length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words or below 4,000 words will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose, too short if they omit important details, neglect relevant prior art, or tamper with formatting rules to save on page count.  
 It is important that your submission is formatted correctly. Incorrectly formatted submissions might be rejected. Full online guidance is available from the ACM: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions   
 Templates are available for several platforms:  
 Microsoft Word 
  LaTeX | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf (Latex) | (or search for | ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article | ) 
  First, authors prepare their manuscript in the designated single-column format in PDF using LaTeX or Microsoft Word. LaTeX users should use \documentclass[manuscript, review]{acmart}. For an anonymous submission, use \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} to automatically replace the authors for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. The authors then submit the PDF and the source files via PCS  . Reviewers will review the papers in the single-column format.  
 Upon conditional acceptance of an article, authors revise the manuscript and submit publication-ready source files to PCS  . The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS: https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow

 Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Submission  
 ACM publications are reviewed and read by many people. Making your paper accessible will help to promote the equal participation of people with disabilities. This section describes how to check if your PDF is accessible and how to fix the most common accessibility problems. For more information please refer to Adobe’s accessibility resource center.  
 How do I test if my PDF is accessible?  
 The document should be tagged. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Description’ tab. Look for ‘Tagged PDF: Yes’ among the set of advanced properties. If you do not have access to Adobe Acrobat, try selecting some text in the PDF and pasting it into a text editor. If you can’t do this, or the text looks wrong, chances are your document is not readable with a screen reader.  
 Check the accessibility. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. ‘Accessibility’. ‘Full Check’. The checker will report accessibility problems.  
 Fonts should be embedded, or your PDF will need to be regenerated, and you may lose the accessibility that you have added. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Fonts’ tab. All of the fonts should have the word ’embedded’ in parentheses after the font name (unless they are not visible in the final document).  
 How do I fix accessibility problems?  
 Word users should correct as many problems as possible in the Word source file rather than the PDF, as described in the next section. On a PC, the Adobe plugin for Word can export accessibility features from the Word document into the PDF.  
 On a Mac, this is not the case. Those using Word on a Mac, and all LaTeX users will need to edit the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat. A better basic PDF may be produced by using latex2pdf as opposed to ps2pdf. See also the WebAim PDF Accessibility primer [ http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/resources.html  ], which provides information for OpenOffice users.  
 The accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro provides help with fixing many accessibility problems. The following steps are for Adobe Acrobat Pro 9. For more detailed instructions for Adobe Acrobat Pro XI see the Accessible PDF guidelines. You can also find more information on Adobe’s accessibility resources page  
 Add tags. | Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. Select ‘Accessibility’, then ‘Add tags to document’. 
  Add alternative text for figures. | Context-click the Figure, select ‘Properties’, and fill in ‘Alternate Text’. If no ‘Properties’ option appears, go to the ‘Advanced’ menu, select ‘Touch Up Reading Order’, and then try context-clicking on the figures again, looking for an ‘Edit alternate text’ option. 
  Specify the document language. | Go to the ‘File’ menu. Select ‘Properties’, then the ‘Advanced’ tab, ‘Language’ field. In some versions of Acrobat, the ‘Properties’ option is called ‘Document Properties’. In some versions, the ‘Language’ field is in a ‘Reading Options’ tab. 
  Define tab order. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Pages’. 
  Click on any page, then type Ctrl-A (or Command-A on a Mac) to select all the pages. 
  Go to the ‘Options’ menu in the top right of the dialogue box (icon showing two cogs), and select ‘Page Properties’. 
  In the ‘Tab Order’ tab, select ‘Use document structure’. 
  Make sure tables have headings. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Tags’. 
  Select the ‘Tags’ tab. This panel shows the document structure as a tree. 
  Navigate to the table cells that should be headers. 
  Check they have the type <TH>. If not, then right-click on the header cell, select ‘properties’, select the ‘Tag’ tab, and change the value for ‘Type’ to ‘Table Header Cell’. 
  Creating an accessible PDF directly from Word  
 The following link provides step-by-step instructions for adding basic accessibility information to a Word document on a PC, then exporting it to a PDF document intended for ACM: Create an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word   
 These guidelines were adopted from ASSETS 2020.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All submissions must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgments section that reveals the authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the submission is left to the authors’ discretion. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Review Process  
 After the submission deadline, each paper will be assigned to a split committee during the PCS submission process in consultation with SCs, and at the discretion of the technical program chairs. The DIS 2025 paper committees will be composed of Associate Chairs that collectively represent expertise across all contribution types. The process will be similar to the DIS 2024 conference and is intended to foster discussion across contribution types and also ensure equitable workload across ACs.  
 SCs will then assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC (who will be blind wrt the authors’ identity) will each write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. As part of this process, we will strive to find ACs and reviewers who are experts in the topic area of each submission. We also highly encourage all authors to sign up and volunteer to be reviewers.  
 After the reviews have been written, the 1AC for a paper will examine the paper and review content, trigger discussions among the review panel if required, and write a meta-review of the paper that summarizes the three submitted reviews. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they will be required to write a review as well as a meta-review; we will strive to distinguish between the 1AC’s assessment of the submission and the summarisation of the other reviews.  
 The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper’s acceptance or rejection to the SC responsible for that submission. SCs and ACs will meet at a virtual program committee meeting with the technical program chairs to discuss the final acceptance of papers for inclusion in the program  
 Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of Designing Interactive Systems 2025 and will become available in ACM Digital Library.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their paper on or before the notification date of 8th April 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera-ready submission” and submitted to PCS by the deadline of 22nd April 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.  
 Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permission to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (paper/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Responsibility for obtaining permission to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference. All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access, or institutional enrollment in the ACM Open  program. More information on rights management can be found here: https://authors.acm.org/  . Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors may be asked to opt-in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference.  
 Accepted submissions will also be asked to prepare and submit a short teaser video (approximately one minute) to promote contributions at the conference and to share the work with the broader community.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid unless the person presenting the paper or pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published papers will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)   
   
 Mission  
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP Tcl, Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and development.  
 http://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/DLS/   
 Latest  
 In 2024, the Dynamic Languages Symposium will take a hiatus.  
 We are planning to return in 2025!  
 If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to the steering committee chair!

  Title: SqueakJS: A Modern and Practical Smalltalk that Runs in Any Browser 
  Conference: DLS 2014 
  Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2661088.2661100 
  Citation: This paper reports on SqueakJS, a fully compatible Squeak/Smalltalk implemented in pure JavaScript. In 2014, it demonstrated that with thoughtful implementation techniques, browsers and their JavaScript VMs can enable applications as dynamic and interactive as Smalltalk environments. Furthermore, the paper details how powerful programming language features such as object enumeration, application snapshotting, custom graphics interfaces, as well as basic file abstractions can be realized inside the browser environment. | Today, SqueakJS continues to be used in education, for web applications, and as environments to preserve important parts of Smalltalk’s history, and with it, computing history.

  Title: Cast Insertion Strategies for Gradually-Typed Objects 
  Conference: DLS 2013 
  Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2508168.2508171 
  Citation: This paper explored the costs, both at micro and macro scale of various strategies for protecting gradual types in a gradually-typed programming language, examining how different strategies affected untyped typed, or both components of code. It is a seminal contribution to understanding the performance of gradual typing, which since then has been an area of important research. The strategies used in gradually-typed languages today can trace their lineage back to the strategies described and proposed in this paper. In particular, the proposed hybrid approach has been adapted time and time again by many systems, giving this work a lasting impact beyond its original scope.

  Title: Self-optimizing AST interpreters 
  Conference: DLS 2012 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384577.2384587 
  Citation: Over the past decade, the authors and their collaborators have taken the ideas from this paper and turned it into the Truffle and GraalVM system which has revolutionized how we implement languages on the JVM. Today, the GraalVM is a major product and Truffle is a language implementation technology producing high-performance implementations of everything from Ruby to C all built upon the ideas of AST rewriting in the interpreter.

  Title: PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine Construction 
  Conference: DLS 2006 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753 
  Citation: The 2006 DLS paper "PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine Construction" introduced the PyPy Python interpreter and the RPython framework. Both are still highly relevant in various areas to this day and will continue to be in influential for many years, thus demonstrating highly impressive long-term vision and impact. The paper laid the theoretical and practical foundations of constructing a virtual machine from a high-level description and was consequently built upon by numerous follow-up publications. The software, which continues to be developed by a large and active open source community, proved extensively usable in multiple academic and industrial contexts.

  Title: Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming–An Overview of ContextL 
  Conference: DLS 2005 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842 
  Citation: The 2005 DLS paper "Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming: An Overview of ContextL" introduced a framework that enables programmers to modify the behavior of a program based on the context in which it is used, without requiring changes to the original program. This paper triggered a cascade of research on Context-oriented Programming and spawned a community with its own international workshop series, which is still going strong today.

  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind, two-phase reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2022 will run a two-phase reviewing process to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Submitted papers need to conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations in their paper submissions.  
 Submission Site   
 Please take a moment to read the instructions below before using the submission site. After acceptance, the camera-ready versions will be collected by Conference Publishing Consulting.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  .  
 Format   
 Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart  format  , sigplan  sub-format, 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the provided ACM SIGPLAN acmart templates  . Author–year and numeric citation styles are both acceptable.  
 Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the 10pt  option in the \documentclass  command: \documentclass[10pt,sigplan]{acmart}  . If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size.  
 For reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission with the LaTeX \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  command.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, papers are limited to 12 pages and 10pt including bibliographic references and appendices. For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages including bibliographic references.  
 Second-Phase Revisions   
 DLS 2022 uses a two-phase review system to provide authors with extra support and an opportunity to revise submissions. The extent of revisions is limited by the available time of about 4 weeks, so the program committee will use the two-phase process only for mandatory revisions that can be completed in that time.  
 To facilitate reviewing, we ask that the revisions be accompanied with:  
 Highlighted changes, either done manually or with a tool such as | latexdiff 
  A brief, high-level description of changes, and how they address the concerns raised in the reviews 
  For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages, including bibliographic references  .  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Contributions  
  
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share research and experience on all aspects on dynamic languages.  
 After two decades of dynamic language research and DLS, it is time to reflect and look forward to what the next two decades will bring. This year’s DLS will therefore be a special DLS focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. To do the notion of “symposium” justice, we will actively invite speakers to present their opinions on where Dynamic Languages might be, will be, or should be going in the next twenty years.  
 Speakers will be announced step by step over the coming weeks.  
 As a research venue, we also invite high quality papers reporting original research and experience related to the design, implementation, and applications of dynamic languages. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 innovative language features 
  innovative implementation techniques 
  innovative applications 
  development environments and tools 
  experience reports and case studies 
  domain-oriented programming 
  late binding, dynamic composition, and run-time adaptation 
  reflection and metaprogramming 
  software evolution 
  language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages 
  dynamic optimization 
  interpretation 
  just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation 
  soft/optional/gradual typing 
  hardware support 
  educational approaches and perspectives 
  semantics of dynamic languages 
  frameworks and languages for the Cloud and the IoT 
  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2023 uses a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2023 will run a single-phase reviewing process with shepherding to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library (TBC) and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2023papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind, two-phase reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2022 will run a two-phase reviewing process to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Submitted papers need to conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations in their paper submissions.  
 Submission Site   
 Please take a moment to read the instructions below before using the submission site. After acceptance, the camera-ready versions will be collected by Conference Publishing Consulting.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  .  
 Format   
 Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart  format  , sigplan  sub-format, 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the provided ACM SIGPLAN acmart templates  . Author–year and numeric citation styles are both acceptable.  
 Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the 10pt  option in the \documentclass  command: \documentclass[10pt,sigplan]{acmart}  . If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size.  
 For reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission with the LaTeX \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  command.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, papers are limited to 12 pages and 10pt including bibliographic references and appendices. For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages including bibliographic references.  
 Second-Phase Revisions   
 DLS 2022 uses a two-phase review system to provide authors with extra support and an opportunity to revise submissions. The extent of revisions is limited by the available time of about 4 weeks, so the program committee will use the two-phase process only for mandatory revisions that can be completed in that time.  
 To facilitate reviewing, we ask that the revisions be accompanied with:  
 Highlighted changes, either done manually or with a tool such as | latexdiff 
  A brief, high-level description of changes, and how they address the concerns raised in the reviews 
  For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages, including bibliographic references  .  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 About the Conference  
 This is the conference of the SIAM Activity Group on Applied & Computational Discrete Algorithms  .  
 ACDA25 brings together researchers who design and study combinatorial and graph algorithms motivated by applications. ACDA25 is organized by SIAM under the auspices of its Activity Group on Applied and Computational Discrete Algorithms. ACDA25 includes in its scope all topics where models and algorithms from discrete mathematics are applied to solve problems in computer science, scientific computing, data science, physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, social and information sciences, etc. ACDA25 invites papers on the formulation of combinatorial problems from applications; theoretical analyses; design of algorithms; computational evaluation of the algorithms; and deployment of the resulting software to enable applications.  
 The ACDA25 conference will include refereed proceedings as well as talks without proceedings papers (in the conventional SIAM style of conferences), posters, tutorials, invited talks, and industry sessions. Awards will be given for best paper, best poster, and best student presentation. Proceedings of the first two ACDA conferences organized in 2021 and 2023 are available here  .  
 The following conferences will be held jointly:  
    SIAM Conference on Applied and Computational Discrete Algorithms (ACDA25)

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

  DLT Award  
 A special DLT award was given to professors Arto Salomaa and Grzegorz Rozenberg during the 20th DLT symposium in Montreal in 2016. The award was given due to their distinguished contributions to automata theory and founding the DLT conference. The award consisted of a DLT Award diploma and an artistic glass work of an owl.  

  Salomaa Prize  
 As a continuation of the DLT Award, an annual prize, named as Salomaa Prize  , was created in 2018. The first prize was awarded in the DLT symposium in Tokyo in 2018. The prize consists of a diploma and 2000 euros prize funded by the University of Turku, the home university of Arto Salomaa. The selection of the winner is decided by an international prize committee  which is appointed by the steering committee of DLT. There is an open call for nominations  .

  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind, two-phase reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2022 will run a two-phase reviewing process to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Submitted papers need to conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations in their paper submissions.  
 Submission Site   
 Please take a moment to read the instructions below before using the submission site. After acceptance, the camera-ready versions will be collected by Conference Publishing Consulting.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  .  
 Format   
 Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart  format  , sigplan  sub-format, 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the provided ACM SIGPLAN acmart templates  . Author–year and numeric citation styles are both acceptable.  
 Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the 10pt  option in the \documentclass  command: \documentclass[10pt,sigplan]{acmart}  . If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size.  
 For reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission with the LaTeX \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  command.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, papers are limited to 12 pages and 10pt including bibliographic references and appendices. For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages including bibliographic references.  
 Second-Phase Revisions   
 DLS 2022 uses a two-phase review system to provide authors with extra support and an opportunity to revise submissions. The extent of revisions is limited by the available time of about 4 weeks, so the program committee will use the two-phase process only for mandatory revisions that can be completed in that time.  
 To facilitate reviewing, we ask that the revisions be accompanied with:  
 Highlighted changes, either done manually or with a tool such as | latexdiff 
  A brief, high-level description of changes, and how they address the concerns raised in the reviews 
  For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages, including bibliographic references  .  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 CALL FOR PAPERS  

 Call for papers (PDF)   CALL FOR PAPERS  12th INTERNATIONAL BALTIC CONFERENCE ON DATABASES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (DB&IS)  
   4-6 July, 2016  
   Riga, LATVIA  Included in IEEE list of conferences  .  Conference proceedings will be published by Springer   in the series Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS)   indexed by SCOPUS  and submitted for indexation in Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index .  Post-conference proceedings of selected and extended papers will be published by IOS Press  in the series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications  as Open Access Ebook, indexed by SCOPUS  and Web of Science  . The other extended papers will be published in Baltic Journal of Modern Computing  , indexed by Web of Science.  Data management is fundamental for most information systems (IS) and especially for those based on the web. As the volume of data created globally is expected to grow exponentially in forthcoming years, management of big data gains importance in database research and development. Another new research area of great interest is the fusion or linking of structured and unstructured data in IS, tightly related to semantic technologies. In addition, explosion of data usage scenarios, and shifts in computing hardware and platforms highly influence data management and development of modern information systems. The Baltic conference on databases and IS is an international forum among researchers and developers of databases and IS. The purpose of this conference series is to bring together researchers, practitioners and PhD students in the fields of advanced database and IS research, and provide an environment to exchange research findings and ideas on the matters, where development of reliable and sustainable systems, with data in the central role, has become crucial in modern diverse IS engineering. The conference will feature original research and application papers on the theory, design and implementation of today's IS on a set of themes and issues.This conference is continuing a series of successful biennial Baltic conferences on databases and IS, which have been held in Trakai (1994), Tallinn (1996, 2002, 2008, 2014), Riga (1998, 2004,2010), and Vilnius (2000, 2006, 2012). DB&IS 2016  will take place in Riga  whose picturesque medieval Old City is known around the world for its well-preserved completeness and authentic Hanseatic architecture. Enchanting atmosphere, rich cultural scene, beautiful surroundings, cutting-edge restaurants, cafés and clubs − there is certainly something for everyone in Riga. Abstract submission deadline: 01 Jan 2016    Extended 24 Jan 2016    
    Full Paper Submission deadline: 31 Jan 2016  Extended 10 Feb 2016   (firm deadline)

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

24. Conference DNA_1:
Top  
 Biomolecular computing has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that draws together molecular biology, chemistry, computer science and mathematics. Our knowledge on DNA nanotechnology and biomolecular computing increases exponentially with every passing year. The annual international meeting in the field began in 1995 right after the landmark work by L. Adleman, who solved an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem by DNA molecules and opened the door to this new field. Since then, the meeting has been a forum where scientists with different backgrounds, yet sharing a common interest in biomolecular computing meet, and present their latest results.  
 The annual meeting was called International Meeting on DNA Based Computers   till 2003 (DNA9), and from 2004 (DNA10) it is called International Meeting on DNA Computing.   From 2009 (DNA15), the meeting is called International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming.

 The program committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its general accessibility to the DocEng audience. Papers will be judged on significance, originality, and clarity. The paper must be organised so that it is easily understood by an audience with varied expertise. The paper should clearly identify what has been accomplished, why it is significant, and how it relates to previous work.  
 Submissions  
 Full papers  : describing complete works of research (up to 10 pages). 
  Short papers  : describing smaller complete works of research, novel challenges or visions (up to 4 pages). 
  Demonstrations  : of interesting use-cases of systems or tools (up to 2 page abstract). 
  We are excited to announce a new Demonstrations submission type for DocEng 2025! Authors are invited to submit a 2-page abstract highlighting use cases, systems, or processes focused on document engineering. This submission type welcomes contributions from both technical and non-technical practitioners, providing a platform to share experiences, insights, and recommendations for future directions in document-related innovation.  
 Submissions should be prepared using the ACM format. Guidelines are available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  . Please note that Word users should use the interim template; DocEng does not use TAPS.  
 Accepted papers will be presented as a talk or poster. Demonstrators will give 10-minute presentations in a demonstration session.  
 Papers can be submitted online at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doceng25  .

  Symposia 
  DocEng 2025 

 Document engineering  is the computer science discipline that investigates systems for documents in any form and in all media. As with the relationship between software engineering and software, document engineering is concerned with principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, and maintain documents.  
 The ACM Symposium on Document Engineering  is an annual meeting of researchers active in document engineering. Interested researchers are invited to submit papers and to attend the Symposium, which is held in the latter part of each year. DocEng is the leading international ACM Symposium for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences in the domain of document engineering. It is sponsored by ACM by means of the ACM SIGWEB Special Interest Group and in cooperation with ACM SIGDOC. All DocEng Proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library  .

 Call for papers  
 DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions, moreover this year for the first time we will invite extended abstracts on visions, challenges, and opportunities for artificial intelligence in data analytics.  
 The best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a special issue of Information Systems  .  
 Long papers | include novel and mature research, industrial, or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might be accepted to the workshop as short papers. 
  Short papers | include (ongoing) novel research works with preliminary results and vision/position papers outlining research issues for future work. 
  Extended abstract | will be invited to present in the interactive panel session, and include initial controversial ideas and visions, reports on early (or negative) results, or reflections on existing and future challenges on the theme of the interactive session. 
  The page limit is 8 pages  for full papers, 4 pages  for short papers, and 2 pages  for extended abstracts (in CEUR format  , double-column, excluding references). Each submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee, the review process is single-blind, and thus authors must include their names and affiliations in submissions. Extended abstracts are short papers with an abstract, a main body, and references but have only 2 standard pages of content, references included.  
 Interactive Panel Session on: Federated and Distributed Data Spaces  
 For DOLAP 2025, we solicit extended abstracts about perspectives on exciting and controversial issues of broad interest to the community around the topic of Data Spaces. Extended abstracts on this topic can present a vision as well as early or negative results, or comments that can influence recent advancements and research directions. For instance:  
 How are Data Spaces transforming traditional data management and analytics paradigms? 
  How can we ensure data sovereignty and trust within Data Spaces while promoting data sharing and collaboration? 
  How can we address the scalability and performance issues in querying and analyzing data across distributed Data Spaces? 
  What are the implications of data analytics on Data Spaces for data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations like GDPR? 
  What new opportunities and challenges do Data Spaces present for machine learning and AI applications? 
  We welcome submissions that explore these questions or related topics, providing insights into the future of Data Spaces and their role in shaping the landscape of data analytics and management.  
 The panel session will feature short presentations followed by extensive and interactive discussions  on the presented topics. We encourage the authors to propose topics and perspectives that will engage the audience and ignite debate among the participants. Ultimately, the goal is to tap into one of the original functions of workshops as a forum for discussion, where researchers come together to brainstorm and contribute to paving the way for future research directions.  
 Research topics  
 Research topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Design and Language | Data management fundamentals | : architectures, design, ETL/ELT, reverse ETL, modeling, data integration, database design for big data, query processing, maintenance, evolution, security, personalization, and privacy in decision support systems.

 DOLAP: the International Workshop on Design, Optimization, Languages and Analytical Processing of Big Data  
 DOLAP is established as one of the reference places for researchers  to publish their work in the broad area of data decision support systems. The DOLAP workshop maintains a high quality of accepted papers, as attested by its ranking as “very good event” in the last edition of the GII-GRIN-SCIE Conference Ranking  . Every year, the best papers published at DOLAP are invited to submit extended version to a special issue on a highly reputed international journal (like Information Systems  or Data & Knowledge Engineering  ). Moreover, the high-quality program of DOLAP includes invited keynotes  from reputed speakers, a best paper  award since 2020, and uses open proceedings  since 2017. A test-of-time award  was given in 2023 to celebrate the 25th edition of DOLAP.  
 Research focus  
 Research in data warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, management, and use of information systems for decision support. Nowadays, due to the advent of Big Data, Decision Support Systems (DSS) include a wider range of systems, in which novel solutions combine advanced data management and data analytics, (semi-)automating the data lifecycle (from ingestion to visualization). Yet, modern data analytics systems acknowledge the relevance of managing data in an efficient way (by means of data modeling and optimized data processing) to serve innovative data analysis bringing added value to organizations.  
 Data platforms of the future will consequently be significantly different than what the current state-of-the-practice supports. The trend is to move from current systems that are “data presenting” to more dynamic systems that allow the semi-automation of the decision making process (including both data management and data analysis tasks). This means that systems partially guide their users towards data discovery, management and system-aided decision making via intelligent techniques (beyond OLAP and exploiting artificial intelligence) and visualization. In the backstage, the advent of the big data era requires that new methods, models, techniques and architectures are developed to cope with the increasing demand in capacity, data type diversity, schema and data variability and responsiveness. And of course, this does not necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, but rather, complementing the wealth of research in data management and anlytics with other approaches.  
 We envision DOLAP as a forum to discuss, foster and nurture novel ideas  around these new landscapes of decision support systems and data platoforms in the era of big data in order to produce new exciting results, within a strong, vibrant community around these areas.  
 The new logo  
 After 25 years of workshops, we have revamped the original logo  to represent the main themes that are driving the scope of DOLAP. While the cube is an obvious reference to the multidimensional data, here is the breakdown of the symbols on its sides.  
    
 OLAP  
 The star and snowflake schemas laid the foundation to multidimensional data modeling and implementation of data warehouses, i.e., the building block of any business intelligence and OLAP application, identifying the roots of DOLAP's scope   

 Big Data  
 The big data revolution imposed disruptive changes at the levels of the 4 Vs (volume, velocity, variety, veracity), pushing researchers and practitioners into rethinking practices of data (and metadata) managament and analytical processing   

 ML & AI  
 If machine learning techniques have always been paired with OLAP analyses to support the decision-making process, the ground-breaking advancements in the field of artificial intelligence are further pushing the boundaries of what analytical applications can achieve   

 Data-driven decision-making is a research topic in continuous evolution, always encountering new challenges and opening to tremendous opportunities, inspiring research work that takes data analysis to an ever-higher level. The DOLAP workshop is the perfect venue for researchers to share their latest work in this area and join a strong and proactive data-enthusiast community.

 SJR   

 The SJR is a size-independent prestige indicator that ranks journals by their 'average prestige per article'. It is based on the idea that 'all citations are not created equal'. SJR is a measure of scientific influence of journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from It measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is.

 Citations per document   

 This indicator counts the number of citations received by documents from a journal and divides them by the total number of documents published in that journal. The chart shows the evolution of the average number of times documents published in a journal in the past two, three and four years have been cited in the current year. The two years line is equivalent to journal impact factor ™ (Thomson Reuters) metric.

  Call For Papers   
   
 The 25th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'25) seeks original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where documents and document collections play a key role. DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these. In particular, DocEng'25 seeks contributions in the area of cooperative work with documents. You are invited to submit original papers to DocEng'25, to be held in Nottingham, UK. Attendees at this international forum have interests that span all aspects of document engineering and applications.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-10-01

 LLNL is issuing a call for proposals for experiments in the Discovery Science (DS) program on the NIF starting nominally in FY2026 and extending into FY2027. We expect to allocate 14 days of facility time for DS experiments beginning in FY2026; this is necessary to accommodate disruptions to planned campaigns. As in previous years, if the FY25 or FY26 enacted budgets contain a significant cut to LLNL’s ICF Program, the time awarded to Discovery Science under this call may be reduced.  
 The application process is as follows:  
 Applicants shall enter a title and upload a Letter of Intent (LOI) via the | NIF User Portal | by | June 26, 2024. | The template for the LOI is available for download from the NIF User Portal. The LOI should be no more than three pages in length, including references and figures. The LOI should emphasize what capabilities are required from the facility to support the experiments, and should provide enough detail of the proposed investigations to allow the NIF User Office and the DS Program Leader to provide meaningful feedback. Applicants are free to submit as many proposals as they wish. A separate LOI must be submitted for each proposed campaign. 
  After NIF User Office and DS Program Leader feedback on the LOI is provided, applicants so invited may submit the full written proposal via the | NIF User Portal | by | September 18, 2024 | . Based on a review of the full proposal by the DS Technical Review Committee (TRC), the NIF Director will invite submitters of the top proposals to prepare an oral presentation in support of their proposal, which will be presented in the late-October time frame, via remote access. Decisions on the proposals are expected to be communicated before the end of December. Format and other relevant details for the oral presentation will be provided at the time invitations are made. 
  Facility access is allocated in units of time (typically “shot days”). The number of shots that can be accomplished per day is a function of experimental complexity. Awards will be made commensurate with the science needs of the proposal. Awards to date have been for one to three days per campaign. All researchers are welcome to apply, including those who have been awarded time in previous solicitations. The NIF DS TRC will use its discretion in evaluating new proposals from teams that have previously been awarded time but have not yet taken shots or produced and published data. Teams that have previously been awarded time and have taken shots will need to provide a description of what has been learned, the status of the analysis, and a list of any publications from previous NIF DS shots that have appeared or have been submitted for publication.  
 A resource for potential applicants is the NIF User Guide, which is available online at this link.  Any questions regarding this process or details regarding the NIF facility should be directed to NIF User Office staff. We are providing a single point of contact for facility questions; only responses from the NIF User Office Director, Kevin Fournier, should be taken as the facility guidance on capabilities  .  
 Proposal subject areas:  
 Researchers may apply for NIF facility time to execute experiments in any area of science accessible on the NIF. Proposals will be judged on their scientific merit and technical achievability. Science relevant to fusion ignition will be considered but will be judged solely on the basis of its quality as fundamental science. In particular, the results of the experiment must be of significant interest in other fields, consistent with guidelines for publication in a highly ranked journal. Examples of previously awarded successful proposals are available for prior years through 2023.   
 All researchers involved in NIF experiments will be required to follow LLNL policies and procedures regarding site access, computer use, and related topics. The PI for each research team that is awarded facility time through this call is encouraged to present their proposed research program at the NIF User Group Meeting that will take place in February 2024. (An award of shot time does not come with funding to support the PI’s travel to the NIF User Group Meeting.)  
 The facility welcomes proposals that use existing platforms, diagnostics, target fabrication and other capabilities. We also welcome proposals to develop new platforms that will use existing diagnostic capabilities in new ways or develop new capabilities. It is no longer necessary to choose one of these categories when creating a record in the NIF User Portal.  
 Research groups that have a novel idea that they think will make a good proposal in the future are invited to contact the nifuseroffice  [at] llnl.gov  (NIF User Office)   to request guidance on developing their ideas into concepts that can be pursued at the NIF or proposed in subsequent calls for DS proposals.  
 Eligible applicants:  
 Principal Investigators, Experimental Leads, and team members may be associated with a national laboratory, academic institution, or the private sector, and may be from the United States (US) or outside the US. Each LOI will undergo both technical review as well as a national security review consistent with LLNL and NNSA policies. Invitations to submit full proposals following the LOI review will reflect the outcome of that review. (Proposals submitted in response to this call will undergo both technical and national security reviews as well.)  
 How to apply:  Applicants will upload a completed LOI template via the NIF User Portal  by June 26, 2024  . Full proposals must be completed and submitted electronically by September 18, 2024  . Proposal instructions can be found on the Call for Proposal Website.   
 Further information regarding the LOI submission is available by contacting the NIF User Office: (925) 422-2179, nifuseroffice  [at] llnl.gov  (nifuseroffice[at]llnl[dot]gov.)

 Call for Hosting DSAA Proposals   
 We are currently soliciting bid proposals to host the future International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA’202x) in three years or later. While we will consider bids from all geographical regions, we particularly encourage bids from the regions following the Asia-Europe-America rotation pattern.  
 All bids should be made by individuals or groups backed up by a host academic and/or research institution (typically a university or research center) in the relevant domains and disciplines.  
 All enquiries regarding DSAA’202x bids should be directed to the chair of DSAA Steering Committee, Prof Longbing Cao ( bids@dsaa.co  ), while you can also talk to an Advisory Committee and Steering Committee member. You are strongly encouraged to initiate the discussions well before drafting your proposal and the bid deadline.  
 DASS Profile  
 DSAA has been competitively ranked in various ranking systems including CORE, CCF and Google Metrics, it is ranked A in CORE.  
 The DSAA conference was initially established in 2014, jointly technically sponsored by IEEE and ACM. Since 2015, DSAA has been fully sponsored by IEEE, becoming an IEEE conference, and co-sponsored by ACM, in addition to sponsorship from IEEE Big Data Initiative. In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) officially started to sponsor DSAA; DSAA becomes the only data science event that is jointly sponsored by ACM, IEEE and ASA.  
 DSAA’2024 is held in San Diego, United States (Oct 6th-10th, 2024); DSAA’2023 in Thessaloniki, Greece (9-13 Oct, 2023); DSAA’2022 online (October 13-16, 2022); DSAA’2021 in Porto, Portugal (6-9 Oct 2021); DSAA’2020 in Sydney, Australia (6-9 Oct 2020); DSAA’2019 in Washington DC, USA (5-8 Oct 2019); DSAA’2018 in Turin, Italy (1-4 Oct 2018); DSAA’2017 in Tokyo, Japan (19-21 Oct 2017); DSAA’2016 in Montreal, Canada (17-19 Oct 2016); IEEE DSAA’2015 in Paris, France (19-21 Oct 2015); and DSAA’2014 in Shanghai, China (30 Oct-1 Nov, 2014), with over 200 participants from over 40 countries.  
 DSAA has firmly established itself as the premier forum in the area of data science, big data, advanced analytics, statistics, and machine learning for industry, government and academic participants. This is ensured by such features as a very competitive acceptance rate (about 10%) for regular papers, high profile core function chairs, 10 pages in IEEE double-column format by double-blind review, interdisciplinary and cross-domain engagement from statistics, industry, and government. The conferences hold three main tracks: Research, Applications, and Special Session tracks, in addition to the first day as the industry day, data science school, student poster sessions, and industry poster sessions. DSAA features unique values and activities, including the Trends & Controversies session, and the Invited Industry Talks session, to promote the development of data science, and encourage dialogue across disciplines and industry and academia. DSAA also have common activities, such as plenary keynote talks, panel sessions, associated tutorials, and social events.  
 Individuals and groups who are interested in hosting DSAA can find more information from the DSAA website ( www.dsaa.co  ), including links to past DSAA conferences, the Advisory Committee and Steering Committee. The DSAA conference guidance is available in the DSAA website.

  Paper Notification: July 24, 2024 
  Paper Camera-ready: August 21, 2024 
  Paper Submission  
 All papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair  (under the "Research" Track).  
 The length of each paper submitted to the Research tracks should be no more than ten (10) pages and should be formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. For further information and instructions, see the IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines  .  
 All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the conference's topics of interest, originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.  
 Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have been issued as technical reports or similar cannot be considered for DSAA'2024. An exception to this rule applies to arXiv papers that were published in arXiv at least a month prior to DSAA'2024 submission deadline. Authors can submit these arXiv papers to DSAA provided that the submitted paper's title and abstract are different from the one appearing in arXiv.  
 Proceedings and Indexing  
 All accepted full-length papers will be published by IEEE and will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for EI indexing through INSPEC by IEEE.  
 Important Policies  
 Reproducibility & supplementary: | The advancement of data science depends heavily on reproducibility. We strongly recommend that the authors release their code and data to the public. Authors can provide an optional two (2) page supplement at the end of their submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file and start at page 3). This supplement can only be used to include (i) information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported in the paper (e.g., various algorithmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper-parameter search spaces, details related to dataset filtering and train/test splits, software versions, detailed hardware configuration, etc.), and (ii) any data, pseudo-code and proofs that due to space limitations, could not be included in the main manuscript. 
  Authorship: | The list of authors at the time of submission is final and cannot be changed. 
  Dual submissions: | DSAA is an archival publication venue as such submissions that have been previously published, accepted, or are currently under-review at peer-review publication venues (i.e., journals, conferences, workshops with published proceedings, etc.) are not permitted. DSAA has a strict no dual submission policy. 
  Conflicts of interest (COI): | COIs must be declared at the time of submission. COIs include employment at the same institution at the time of submission or in the past three years, collaborations during the past three years, advisor/advisee relationships, plus family and close friends. Program chairs and Industry Poster chairs are not allowed to submit papers to the Industry Poster track. 
  Attendance: | At least one author of each accepted poster paper must register in full and attend the conference to present the poster. No-show posters will be removed from the IEEE Xplore proceedings. 
  AI Generated Text: | The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text. 
  Enquiries  
 General enquiries about Research Track paper submissions should be submitted to Track Chairs.

DSN 2025   
 The 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks   
 Naples, Italy, June 23-26, 2025  

 Welcome   
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025), organized by Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia.  
 DSN 2025 will be held in Naples, Italy from 23 to 26 June 2025. Naples, an enchanting city of sea and culture. Naples was founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. Naples is the capital of Campania lies in the bay of the same name next to the volcano Vesuvius and offers a spectacular view as far as the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida. Naples' historic city center is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties, such as Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, and Vesuvius. Neapolitan cuisine is noted for its association with pizza, which originated in the city, as well as numerous other local dishes.  
 We look forward to meeting you in Naples!!!

 DSN-2025: Research Track Call For Contributions   
 Society is increasingly dependent on the robust functioning of all types of computing systems. These systems include mobile/edge devices, networks, personal computers, and large-scale systems and critical infrastructures that provide services we use in our everyday lives for many applications and problems. Failure, incorrect operation, or compromise of computing systems and networks can have dire implications for the safety and security of human and other lives and the environment.  
 The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is devoted to the mission of ensuring that the computing systems and networks on which society relies are robust, i.e., dependable and secure.  
 DSN, one of the longest-running IEEE conferences organizing its 55th edition in 2025, has pioneered the fusion between dependability and security research under a common body of knowledge, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional (malicious) attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. Its distinctive approach to both accidental faults and malicious attacks has made DSN the most prestigious international forum for presenting research that pushes the boundaries in the robustness and resilience of a wide spectrum of computing systems and networks.  
 All aspects of research and practice of computer system robustness (i.e., dependability and security) are within the scope of DSN. Relevant topics include but are not limited to: 1) innovative systems, architectures, protocols, and algorithms for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, eliminating, or recovering from accidental and malicious threats as well as 2) practical experimentation with and assessment of the robustness (dependability and security) of all types of computing systems and networks.  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers on all topics within this broad scope. Example topical areas include but are not limited to the following:  
 Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, memory systems, systems on chip, I/O devices, storage systems, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), edge and mobile devices, data center infrastructure, hardware accelerators, emerging technologies, emerging paradigms like processing in memory & quantum computing) 
  Software (e.g., applications, middleware, distributed algorithms, operating systems, software security, dependable software design) 
  Networked systems and clouds (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, edge computing, cloud computing/storage, networks on chip, network security) 
  Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, assured autonomy, explainable decision-making, acceptability, privacy issues) 
  Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, real-time control of critical systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, railway, medical systems, security and safety of cyber-physical systems) 
  Distributed ledgers/Blockchain (e.g., BFT/consensus algorithms, cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proofs) 
  AI/Machine Learning for resilient systems (e.g., robust, resilient, secure, and explainable AI/Machine Learning techniques; applications of AI/ML techniques for dependability and security, robustness issues in AI/ML systems) 
  Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and assessing robust (dependable and secure) systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis) 
  Emerging technologies and computing paradigms (e.g., robustness, security, dependability issues of emerging memory and storage systems, emerging computing paradigms like quantum computing, processing in memory/sensors/storage/network, 3-dimensional architectures, new hardware/software cooperative paradigms, emerging programming and system paradigms)

 Information to authors   
 Innovative papers in all areas of robust (dependable and secure) systems and networks will be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference broadly and inclusively favors innovative and insightful research that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art systems. Submissions will be judged on insight, originality, significance, correctness, and potential impact.  
 Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2025, if accepted.  
 All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions.  
 At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work in person.  
 Paper Categories   
 When submitting, authors have to select one of the following categories:  
 Regular papers (11 pages)   : a full paper describing a research contribution, including experimental work focused on implementation and evaluation of existing techniques in the DSN thematic areas. Papers should clearly describe a novel scientific contribution and a significant advancement of the state of knowledge in DSN-relevant topics. The paper should address a significant problem with a compelling solution whose validity and practical applicability are clearly discussed.  
 Practical experience reports (7 pages)   : a shorter paper describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and techniques to real-world problems and systems, or based on the empirical analysis of field data using a rigorous scientific approach. A paper in this category is expected to show new insights and experiences informing the research and practice of robust computing system design. Contributions reporting on industry practical experiences and lessons learned are highly encouraged, including studies reporting negative results or challenges about the practical applicability or scalability of research results in industry.  
 Tool descriptions/demonstrations (7 pages)   : descriptions of the architecture, implementation, and usage of substantive tools to aid the research and practice of dependability. A tool paper is expected to describe and demonstrate the value that the tool brings to the dependability community. Making the tool publicly available, whenever possible, is strongly encouraged.  
 The number of pages indicated above includes everything: title page, text, figures, appendices  , etc. Only references are not included in the page limit. Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review  .  
 Independently of the paper category, we expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results and encourage authors, whenever possible, to make both the artifacts and datasets related to the paper publicly available.  
  
 Artifacts   
 DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. DSN 2025 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track that is open to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools.  
 At the time of the submission, authors must indicate (1) whether they intend to submit an artifact for their submission, (2) the type of artifact (code, dataset, or both), (3) a DOI reserved for the artifact on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare), and (4) the badge(s) they are applying for. For more information about how to reserve a DOI and about the three choices available for the badges, see the Call for Artifacts on the DSN’25 website  .  
 Information about the artifact submission will not be shared with the PC. The artifact does not need to be submitted at the same time as the paper. The artifact can be uploaded at the reserved DOI after the paper submission deadline and can be updated until the artifact submission deadline.  
 The artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a single-blind review process, where authors should be available to respond quickly during the artifact evaluation. All artifacts submitted will compete for a “Distinguished Artifact Award” to be decided by that committee.  
 Anonymization Rules   
 Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. An author should always refer to their own related work in the third person, just like they would refer to any other related work. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments).  
 Anonymization should not be done in a way to hurt the review process. For example, omitting published references or anonymizing them for the purposes of a double-blind process can significantly hurt the review process. As such, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. For example, a paper on experiences with the design of .NET should not be rewritten to be about "an anonymous but widely used commercial distributed systems platform."  
 Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. Avoid names that could in any way be interpreted as being derived from the name of an author or identifying an author’s location or affiliation. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own previously published work. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: “Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2021].” with the corresponding citation: “[Anonymous 2021] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.” This is, for example, the case for extended versions of the paper available online. 
  If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chair in a separate email. 
   
 Authors should also avoid broadly advertising their work in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it (for example, presentations in small meetings or seminars are allowed). It is unacceptable to discuss the work with program committee members. Posting the work on ArXiV or a similar site is within the authors’ rights; however, the authors should use a different title than the submission and they should avoid specifying that the work is under submission to DSN. In particular, please ensure that there are not older versions of the paper on ArXiV that have the same title as the submission.  
 Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization, and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded  .  
 Formatting Rules   
 Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society camera-ready 8.5″x11″ two-column camera-ready format (using a 10-point font on 12-point single-spaced leading) as implemented by the LaTeX/Word templates available at the IEEE conference template  page (last updated in 2019):  
 LaTex Package ( ZIP  )  
 Word Template ( DOC  )  
 Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded in the file. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations, etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of acceptance. Please take a note of the following:  
 Submissions should be anonymous. 
  The page limit includes everything except references. 
  The first page must include the title of the paper, the type of the paper (Regular / Practical Experience / Tool), and a maximum 150-word abstract. 
  Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers: describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them. If the title and abstract are not sufficiently descriptive at the time of the abstract deadline, the submission may be rejected without review. 
  The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (and thus has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. 
  There is no page limit for references - however, authors must not put any text or figures on the pages for the references - if so, those pages will be included in the page limits above (it is acceptable for the references to start on the last page of the paper as long as it is within the page limit). 
  Pages should be numbered. 
  The use of color for figures and graphs is encouraged, but the paper should be easily readable if printed in grayscale. 
  Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. 
  Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB. 
   
 Paper Submissions   
 Papers are submitted via the submission website: https://dsn25.hotcrp.com  .  
 The program committee will perform a double-blind review of all submissions, with help from outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.  
 Authors must anonymize their submissions (see Anonymization Rules). Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.  
 Awards   
 DSN gives three Best Paper Awards and one of them, based on the quality of the oral presentation, will also receive a Distinguished Best Paper Award. All of them will be presented in a special Best Paper Session at the conference.  
 The selection of the candidate papers for the awards is carried out as a three-step process. First, the Program Committee picks 6-7 of the accepted papers based on the review and revision process & committee discussion. Second, the Steering Committee (in consultation with the Program Chairs) chooses among these papers the 3 Best Papers that are to be presented in the Best Paper Session at the conference (all these papers receive the Best Paper Award). Third, and finally, the audience at the conference votes among these Best Papers to select the one that should receive the Distinguished Best Paper Award. Attendees are strongly encouraged to read the Best Papers as well as carefully listen to their presentations, and make their Distinguished Best Paper Award choice based on all information they have about the finalized Best Papers and their presentations at the conference.  
 DSN also attributes a group of awards based on nominations. These awards are the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability, the Rising Star in Dependability Award, the Test-of-Time Award, and the Jean-Claude Laprie Award. Please check the relevant page on the DSN website for additional details.  
 As noted above, there will also be a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Review Process and Author Response   
 This year, as initiated in DSN 2023, in addition to the rebuttal process, DSN is following a Paper Revision Process  . For papers that are not early rejects, the authors will be invited to submit a revised paper (as well as a rebuttal) after receiving their reviews. The major goal of the revision process is twofold:  
 1. to strengthen the papers by making sure reviewer comments are properly addressed in a revised version; and 
  2. to enable the reviewers to see how their comments are addressed in a revised version (which is especially useful in cases where rebuttal may not have the same effect). 
  Through this process, we give the authors the ability to submit both a revised paper (based on the received reviews) and a rebuttal. These two serve different purposes. In particular, the rebuttal remains useful for at least three purposes that cannot be easily accomplished with a revised paper:  
 1. to clarify misunderstandings (and point out any other issues) in the reviews; 
  2. to describe a plan for revisions the author would like to make but need more time for than the revision timeframe allows; and 
  3. to provide a summary of changes that helps the authors to describe how they addressed the reviewer comments in the revised paper. 
  The authors of all papers that are invited for revision will be allowed one extra page to properly address reviewer comments. In other words, the revised (and, if accepted, the final) versions of papers will be allowed 12 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for practical experience reports or tool descriptions/demonstrations. The authors will be asked to mark and describe all the changes they made to the submission during the revision process. More information will be provided to authors of papers who are asked to provide a revision as to how to prepare, format, and submit the revised version of the submission. Note that submitting a revised paper does not guarantee acceptance of the paper to the conference and all revised papers will be reviewed and discussed by the Program Committee.  
 To limit the load on the reviewers, the rebuttal will be strictly limited to 750 words. Any attempt to provide extra information, for example by including images in the rebuttal, will cause the rebuttal material to be discarded.  
 DSN will continue to employ the Early Rejection Notification Policy  . Papers that are rejected in the first reviewing round will receive their rejection notification and reviews by January 27, 2025. As such, the authors may get started earlier on improving their manuscript for a future submission, if they wish to do so.  
 All accepted papers will be subject to the revision and approval of a PC member acting as a shepherd.  
 Open Science Policy   
 After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports the adoption of open source and open data principles and encourages all authors to make their prototypes available to the research community and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Accepted papers can participate in the artifact evaluation process described above.  
 Ethical considerations   
 Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g., by following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.  
 Contact the program co-chairs dsn25pcchairs@gmail.com  if you have any questions.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived conflict to the PC chairs.  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion concerning the paper.  
 Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members   
 To avoid potential bias, the DSN Program Committee Co-Chairs are not allowed to (co-)author any submission to the conference. There are no such restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members including the General chairs since double-blind anonymization rules and conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the processes related to the technical program including the selection of the PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing, and acceptance of papers.

 Generally, IEEE DSAA lasts for three to four days with the first day focusing on industry and government data science innovations, showcases, policy debate, and training. In a four-day mode, DSAA has its conference reception in the evening on the first day, conference opening on the second morning and the conference banquet on the third evening.  
   
  The opening session summarizes the conference arrangements, statistics of submissions and acceptance, the main program, and logistics, etc. by the lead general chair and program chair, and the local arrangement chair. The banquet will be hosted by the conference with the award ceremony, steering committee chair’s brief, possible social program, and a brief introduction to the next year's conference.  
   
  Parallel technical sessions will cover paper presentations from the Research track, Application track, Special Sessions, and other tracks if any (such as journal tracks and poster tracks). An Industry/Government Forum or Industry Day may be held on the first day to widely engage industry and government data scientists and policy-makers. Data Science School may be hosted in parallel to the main conference sessions and special sessions on the second-third days as mini-data science courses including lectures and tutorials. DSAA has unique arrangements of a Trends & Controversies session, and an Industry Invited Talk session, in addition to exhibitions and job fair and matching if possible. Conference organizers may add social programs to the budget within the schedule and budget permit.

  All proposal leaders should arrange travels to attend the corresponding DSAAs and report to the steering committee meeting, with onsite clarification and responses to questions that may be raised by the Committee. The Committee will make their decisions about which bids to host which years of DSAA conferences, and who to be appointed as general chairs and program chairs. If necessary, the Committee holds the right to adjust the core team and appoint core organizers by discussing with the proposal leaders. A successful bid will be announced at the conference banquet, followed by a presentation to be made by the bidding group.  
   
  3. How to operate IEEE DSAA?   
 Committee formation  
 The IEEE DSAA Steering Committee appoints general chairs and program chairs for both Research and Application tracks, who are then responsible for appointing other function chairs. General chairs are responsible for the whole conference operations and success. Program chairs, who report to the general chairs, are responsible for all technical programs including main and special session tracks, data science school/tutorials, and best paper award selection by overseeing and supporting the respective function chairs’ operations.  
   
  Function chairs    
  There may be many function chairs to be collaboratively appointed by general chairs and PC chairs, with the involvement of the Steering Committee chair if necessary. Typical chair roles may include Local Arrangement Chairs, Special Session Chairs, Trends & Controversies Chairs, Industry Invited Talks Chairs, Data Science School Chairs, Tutorial Chairs, Panel Chairs, Best Paper Award Chairs, Next-generation Data Scientists Award Chairs, IEEE Travel Award Chairs, Publication/Proceedings Chairs, Publicity/Media Chairs, Sponsorship Chairs, and Web Chairs.  
   
  DSAA encourages the appointment of function chairs in balanced, diversified, and ethical ways in terms of covering different regions, research areas, and genders while maintaining the candidates' international standing, conference organizing experience, and contributions to the conference.  
   
  General chairs    
  The Steering Committee appoints high-profile international leaders in the DSAA areas as general Chairs. General chairs oversee the whole conference, coordinate a regular (monthly) committee meeting with core function chairs, and make strategic decisions to ensure smooth conference operations, quality and success. General chairs are requested to regularly report to the steering committee chair through monthly meetings. Strategic matters may be discussed with the steering committee chair for approval or support. The general chairs are responsible for the complete financial balance and IEEE conference reporting. Refer to DSAA General Chairs  for more information about general chairs who chaired the past DSAA conferences.  
   
  Program chairs    
  The Steering Committee appoints high-caliber international leaders in the DSAA areas as program chairs of the Research Track and Applications Track. Program chair candidates are expected to have high h-index, past experience in chairing top-tier conferences, and significant recognition by the international communities. DSAA requests senior and active international researchers and professionals to be appointed as program committee members.  
   
  These main track program chairs may discuss to share the workload of managing paper inquiries, submissions, review, and selection. Program chairs are to encourage international participation in the conference, form high-profile senior program committees and regular program committees, and ensure the quality, credibility, diversity, ethics, and integrity of the paper review and selection. None of PC chairs (and track chairs) are allowed to submit papers to the tracks managed by them. PC chairs report to general chairs on a regular basis.  
   
  Refer to DSAA Program Chairs  for more information about program chairs who chaired the past DSAA conferences. Technical program  
 Main tracks    
  In general, IEEE DSAA consists of two main tracks: Research and Application. The Research Track is aimed at collecting original significant contributions that report new ideas, original outcomes, and the latest theoretical foundations and advancement of data science and advanced analytics. The Application Track is aimed at collecting impactful contributions related to successful and reproducible applications, case studies, and best practices of data science and advanced analytics in real-life scenarios. Selected DSAA papers may be invited for extension and selection into journals such as the International Journal of Data Science and Analytics  , Springer.  
   
  A Call for Paper is organized for both tracks, referring to a CFP example  . In the paper submission system (Easychair or Microsoft CMT), Research and Application tracks should be separately established, configured, and managed by respective PC track chairs. Program committees should be formed for each track respectively.  
   
  Special sessions tracks    
    Proposals for organizing special sessions are welcome to encourage research on emerging topics relevant to DSAA. Each special session will be operated as a special track within the conference submission system and program.  
   
  DSAA is developing a special session model that is neither a classic workshop model nor a special session model used in some conferences. DSAA special sessions ensure the quality and integrity of special session papers and their alignment with the main conference in one proceeding (labeled separately per their track names). DSAA does not support separate special session proceedings, special session papers will be included in the same conference proceedings as the main tracks while they should be clearly labeled by their track names.  
   
  The conference's Special Session Chairs coordinate the invitations, acceptances, and operations of all special session proposals. DSAA encourages those existing sessions to be continuously held in the next-year DSAAs to promote and build their corresponding reputation and communities.  
   
  DSAA special session tracks follow the same deadlines as main tracks in submission, review, camera-ready, registration, and IEEE Xplore submissions.  
   
  In the DSAA submission system, PC chairs open special session tracks for respective special sessions. A special session track is managed by the respective special session track chairs as the session organizers, who nominate track PCs to the conference special session chairs for review and confirmation before those qualified PCs are added to the submission system by the track chairs. To maintain the integrity and avoid conflict of interest, special session track chairs are not allowed to submit papers to their own tracks but can submit papers to other tracks.  
   
  DSAA special session papers are reviewed by each session’s program committee, coordinated by the session organizers. Session organizers make recommendations on paper acceptances or rejections, DSAA program chairs or their nominated representatives (i.e., the conference special session chairs) make final decisions by considering the paper quality and the consistency with the main conference. DSAA requests a competitive and consistent acceptance rate for all special sessions. The acceptance rate and acceptance letters are made by the main conference program chairs. We strongly encourage special sessions on statistics/mathematics for data science and data science for industry/government.  
   
  Special sessions on statistics/mathematics for data science 
   To support the cross-disciplinary interactions between statistics/mathematics and broad data science communities, DSAA strategically supports special sessions on statistics/mathematics for data science, which may be organized by statisticians/mathematicians who are interested in data science and in collaborations with broad data science communities especially in computing and informatics. Paper submissions to this special session may be in the form of two-page extended abstracts with full papers to a nominated journal. Invited talks are encouraged.  
   
  Special sessions on data science for industry/government 
   To support the broad/deep engagement of industry/government in data science and the interactions between industry/government and broad data science communities, DSAA strategically supports special sessions on data science for industry/government, which may be organized by industry/government leaders who are interested in data science and in collaborations with broad data science communities especially experienced data science researchers. Submissions to these special sessions may be in the form of two-page extended abstracts with full presentations to the conference if accepted. Invited talks are encouraged.  
   
  Student Poster track    
  Student posters may be considered in a student poster track to showcase state-of-the-art and early-stage research developments by students in data science and analytics disciplines on topics that are of interest to either the research or the application of data science and analytics. The Student Poster paper length is a maximum of two (2) pages and should be formatted in the same way as the main track submissions. The double-blind review will be organized for all student poster submissions. Student poster sessions may be organized in the DSAA conferences with each poster to have a three-minute highlight and its presentation in the conference poster sessions. Accepted DSAA student posters may also be presented in the conference poster sessions. Poster sessions may be in parallel to the respective technical sessions outside the session rooms or at some consolidated places in the conference venue for possible discussions at lunch or reception time. Reception/lunches if provided may be organized in the area of hosting the posters.  
   
  Industry Poster track    
  Industry posters may be considered in an industry poster track to showcase state-of-the-art and early-stage research developments, best practices, or impactful applications of data science for industry, government, and NGO policy-makers and practitioners. An industry poster may share case studies, experience and lessons, and insights and impact without a full-length submission as for the main tracks. The Industry Poster paper length is a maximum of two (2) pages and should be formatted in the same way as the main track submissions. The double-blind review will be organized for all industry poster submissions. Industry poster sessions may be organized in the DSAA conferences with each poster to have a three-minute highlight and its presentation in the conference poster sessions. Accepted DSAA industry posters may also be presented in the conference poster sessions. Poster sessions may be in parallel to the respective technical sessions outside the session rooms or at some consolidated places in the conference venue for possible discussions at lunch or reception time. Reception/lunches if provided may be organized in the area of hosting the posters.  
   
  Keynote speakers    
  Four high profile keynote speakers are usually invited from academia and industry by the conference organizers, with an endorsement from the Steering Committee. The appointment of keynote speakers should consider the speaker's profile, an international reputation, and standing, in addition to the balance and diversity of their gender, regions, and disciplines/areas. Each speaker presents a usually one-hour talk at the plenary session. Keynote speakers are fully sponsored by the conference (including travel, accommodation, registration, and possibly honorarium). Refer to DSAA Keynote Speakers  for more information about keynote speakers who spoke at the past DSAA conferences.  
   
  Trends & Controversies session    
  IEEE DSAAs feature its Data Science Trends & Controversies (T&C) session every year to host visionary talks by invitation only. The T&C session invites visionary leaders to outline different insights and views about today and the future of data science and advanced analytics. Particular topics of interest may include emerging and next-generation research, innovation, challenges and prospects, new research and economic opportunities, products, systems, tools and capability building in relevant domains and research areas, and about policies, standards, social issues, ethics, fairness, security. Specific talks on fostering the next-generation data science profession and education may also be considered.  
   
  Four visionary speakers may be invited from academia and industry to the T&C session by the T&C chairs, in discussions with the general and program chairs. Senior representatives from platinum and gold sponsors may be invited to deliver T&C talks. Each T&C invited talk is given about 30 minutes in the plenary sessions. T&C chairs may discuss with general chairs about possible financial support and local support to T&C speakers, who will receive complimentary registrations by default. Sponsorship may be secured to sponsor T&C speeches.  
   
  Industry/government forum or industry day    
  To support the wide and deep engagement and developments of industry/government data science, DSAA strategically supports an Industry/Government Forum or an industry day on the first conference day. The Forum may be composed of local industry/government showcases, exhibitions, presentations, the Industry Invited Talks session, sponsor’s talks, and presentations accepted by special sessions on data science for industry/government (if any). The Forum may be held as a pre-conference event or a parallel event on the first two days if necessary. Chairs may be appointed to handle local engagement, the Industry Invited Talks session, and special sessions on data science for industry/government, respectively.  
   
  Industry Invited Talks session    
  DSAA features an Industry Invited Talks session to host industry talks by invitation only. This session is about sharing the latest development of advanced data science technologies, systems and tools, projects and practices, and experience and issues. Senior industry/government speakers are invited to share their experience, practice, and vision about topics such as data science innovation, technologies, practice, economy, profession, policy, standardization, vision, and directions.  
   
  Four senior industry/government speakers may be invited by the Industry Invited Talks chairs, in discussions with the general and program chairs. Senior representatives from or recommended by platinum and gold sponsors may be invited to deliver Industry Invited Talks. Each Industry Invited Talk is given about 30 minutes in parallel sessions. Industry Invited Talks chairs may discuss with general chairs about possible financial support and local support to Industry Invited Talks speakers, who will receive complimentary registrations by default. Sponsorship may be secured to support Industry Invited Talks speeches.  
   
  Data science school    
  To leverage the significant market need and gaps in training next-generation data scientists, DSAA strategically supports a Data Science School either as a pre-conference or in parallel to the main conference sessions. DSAA program chairs appoint Data Science School chairs to design and implement a two-day systematic, light, but structured course program, which may consist of introductory lectures and advanced tutorials on data science theories and hands-on practices.  
   
  Tutorials    
  DSAA considers all proposals for introductory lectures and advanced tutorials on any Data Science and Analytics topic. Preferences will be given to invited lectures/tutorials that form a mini and structured data science curriculum, original tutorials that have not yet or recently presented elsewhere. Introductory lectures may target an audience consisting of advanced undergraduate and graduate students, research scientists, as well as attendees from the industry. Topics can be in all areas of data science and analytics, and duration can be either 1/4 (1.5 hours) or 1/2 (3 hours) day. Each accepted lecture/tutorial will receive one free conference registration to DSAA. Presenters will be required to provide comprehensive lecture/tutorial notes (printable slides) well the event opening, which will then be published on the DSAA web site and thus be made available to conference attendees free of charge. Lectures/tutorials may be presented during the main DSAA conference in parallel sessions.  
   
  A tutorial proposal may address the following aspects: The proposed tutorial title 
  The preferred duration (1/4 or 1/2 day) 
  An abstract to introduce the tutorial objectives, topics, scope, and benefits 
  A table of contents in a dot point format with detailed scope and depth of the topics to be covered 
  A brief characterization of the potential target audience for the tutorial, including prerequisite knowledge 
  A very brief biography with detailed contacts of the proposed presenter(s) 
  Background in the tutorial area, including a list of publications/presentations 
  Evidence of teaching experience (courses taught or references) 
  Evidence of scholarship in AI or Computer Science 
  Audio/visual equipment needs for the presentation. 
   
  Submission, review, selection and ethics  
 Submission    
  Conference paper submissions to any main and special session tracks of DSAAs should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages in the IEEE 2-column format (see the IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html  ). Either LaTeX or Word Template is encouraged to be used for formatting conference and special session papers. To help ensure correct formatting, please use the style files for U.S. Letter Size found at the link above as templates for your submission. These include LaTeX and Word. Violations of any of the above paper specifications may result in the rejection of a submission. Please note that the Latex template does not allow for keywords. If you are using the Latex template, do not include keywords in your paper.  
   
  DSAA takes double-blind review, hence author names and affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity.  
   
  Submissions to a special session should be submitted by choosing the respective special session track when you submit a paper to DSAA. A paper can only be allowed to submit to one track in DSAA, either the main track or a special session track. Duplicated submissions to more than one track will be administratively rejected.  
   
  Review    
  All submissions will be double-blind reviewed by at least three Program Committee members on the basis of technical quality, relevance to conference topics of interest, originality, significance, and clarity. A senior program committee member may coordinate the review and recommendation consolidation before a conclusion is formed by the program chairs.  
   
  DSAA conference special session chairs coordinate with each session track’s chairs in the track program committee formation, review, and paper recommendation to ensure the quality consistency, and fairness of all sessions and with the main conference tracks (by collaborating with PC chairs).  
   
  Organizers of each special session assign the session submissions to their track PCs for review. If no enough PCs are available for a track's paper review, PC chairs can assign the track papers to main track PCs for review. Special session organizers make recommendations on each paper in their track. The conference special session chairs check the recommendations from each session and make final decisions by discussing with the track chairs and conference PC chairs who determine the acceptance rate and final decisions. When a dispute is caused, the conference PC chairs discuss with conference special session chairs and make the final decisions. PC chairs and conference special session chairs ensure the quality and acceptance rate integrity between special sessions and between main tracks and special tracks. PC chairs send the final decisions to authors of special sessions.  
   
  Acceptance    
  Following the successful trial of DSAA'2014 to DSAA'2016, DSAA main conferences are expected to maintain a competitive acceptance rate (overall rate lower than 25% with long presentation rate at about 10%), in which both long presentation (about 10% acceptance rate) and regular presentation papers are suggested. Both long and regular presentation papers follow the same length as at submission. The acceptance rate for special sessions is expected to be consistent with the main conference tracks, while PC chairs and special session chairs may decide the specific rate per the quality of the submissions.  
   
  Plagiarism    
  Plagiarism is unacceptable to DSAA. Quotations should be clearly identified and appropriate citations should be included for the verbatim copy and/or reuse of material from other published papers. Submissions must be original and must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere.  
   
  Ethics, diversity, integrity and conflict of interest    
  All DSAA organizers should follow the general act of conduct and research ethics on their roles and responsibilities. Typical rules for ensuring ethics, diversity and integrity and avoiding conflict of interest include: DSAA is highly international and diversified, not only rotating in different countries and regions but also encouraging the diversity and equity of function chair roles and keynote/invited speakers (including covering major disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, informatics and computing and balancing genders, career opportunities and domains). 
  In general, general chairs, PC chairs and local arrangement chairs should not come from same organizations. 
  PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers to any tracks. 
  Special session track chairs are not allowed to submit papers to their own tracks but can submit their papers to other tracks. 
  Award chairs should not accept the invitation if they plan to submit the papers to the conference or there may be potential conflict of interest. 
  Program committee members should not share the submission information with each other and with authors. 
  Conference organizers cannot present keynote speeches, T&C talks, or Invited industry Talks. 
  Tutorial chairs cannot submit tutorial proposals. 
   
  Conference proceedings  
 The conference proceeding (or publication) chairs manage the editing of conference proceedings that include all accepted papers in both main tracks and special session tracks in terms of IEEE specifications and requirements. DSAA holds one proceeding for all accepted papers and posters of main tracks, special session tracks, and poster tracks. Accepted special session submissions will be included in the Special Session part of the main conference proceedings. All papers will be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, EX-indexed. Papers for each track should be separately listed under their respective track names in the proceeding. The proceeding will be decomposed of several parts corresponding to the respective tracks.  
   
  To include DSAA proceedings into IEEE Xplore, publication chairs need to follow IEEE instructions to edit the proceedings by using IEEE provided tools and specifications. The edited proceedings confirmed by IEEE can be copied to USB for conference circulation. IEEE may request the final submission of proceedings to IEEE immediately after the conference for inclusion into the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.  
   
  IEEE DSAA awards  
 DSAA sets up the following awards to acknowledge the significant contributions in key selected areas.  
  DSAA Service Award 
  to award key DSAA organizers who have made significant contributions to the DSAA conference success in each year. Best Research Paper Award 
  to award one best paper selected from all accepted papers in the Research Track. Best Application Paper Award 
  to award one best paper selected from all accepted papers in the Application Track. Next-generation Data Scientist (NGDS) Awards 
  to award distinguished early-career researchers in data science, typically within five years after awarded a Ph.D. qualification.  
  Refer to DSAA Awards  for more information about DSAA awards.  
   
  DSAA Service Award    
  The DSAA Steering Committee selects one representative from each year's DSAA organizing committee to give the DSAA Service Award. This award acknowledges the significant contributions made by the representative to the critical success of the conference. The DSAA Steering Committee will consult the candidate selection with general chairs, PC chairs, and local arrangement chairs. The awardee will be presented a golden-colored plaque at A4 plate on a wooden mount and receive continuous five-year complimentary registrations in the coming five years.  
   
  Best Paper Awards    
  DSAA recommends two best paper awards only: Best Research Paper Award and Best Application Paper Award for the most representative papers selected from Research and Application track respectively. There are no runner-up awards and no student paper awards selected in DSAA. The Best Research Paper Award and Best Application Paper Award will each receive USD$500 from the conference (or its sponsors) plus a golden-colored plaque at A4 plate on a wooden mount.  
   
  An award committee is usually formed by the Best Paper Award chairs who are usually not PC chairs and have no conflict of interest. In the award ceremony, a one-sentence summary is given by the award chair to each award to summarize the most influential contribution made in the paper that makes it unique and qualified for the award. A 20-minute highlight presentation of each awarded paper may be organized in some parallel sessions.  
   
  Next-Generation Data Scientists Award    
  Since 2016, DSAA Steering Committee has launched the Next Generation Data Scientist (NGDS) Award to address the significant gap between the increasing data scientist job requirements and the limited availability of qualified data scientists. The purpose of offering this NGDS award is to encourage young talents to conduct foundational research and applied innovation in Data Science and set a role model for next-generation data scientists. More details are in the Call for NGDS Awards  .  
   
  The NGDS Award is the only one in the world that supports the production of qualified data scientists. Every year, DSAA may offer a limited number of NGDS Awards to full-time early-career researchers who have just got doctorate degrees within five years to the application. DSAA Steering Committee wants the NGDS Awards to be highly prestigious and selective, hence the criteria for NGDS candidate selection are rigorous. If there is no candidate who satisfies the selection criteria in a year, there will be no NGDS award given.  
   
  The NGDS awards may be sponsored by some of the DSAA sponsors. Each NGDS awardee will receive a USD1,000 honorarium. Although the NGDS award is not limited to people who are DSAA authors, all full-time early-career researchers with the acceptance of long-presentation papers at DSAAs are encouraged to apply. Awardees must attend the conference as a condition to receive the awards. A 20-minute highlight presentation by the NGDS awardee may be organized in some plenary or parallel sessions.  
   
  IEEE Student and Researcher Travel Award    
  IEEE CIS sponsors several IEEE CIS Student and Researcher Travel Awards every year to students and professionals who are presenting one or more papers at the DSAA conference. The travel awardees much hold the membership of IEEE and membership of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. DSAA Travel Award chairs need to work with the coordinator of IEEE CIS Student and Researcher Travel Awards nominated by the IEEE CIS about the selection criteria, awardee selection, and offers.  
   
  Local arrangement matters  
 Conference venue and parallel sessions    
  The conference venue should fit the size and relevant activity requirements of the conference including catering for parallel sessions for main, special, and poster sessions, the Industry/Government Forum (if any), the Data Science School (if any), and other extra activities if planned. At least three-to-five parallel sessions may be reserved for three continuous main conference days while pre-conference events (e.g., Industry/Government Forum, Data Science School) may be held on an extra (first) day and on other venues if necessary. The venue should have a large conference room to host the plenary sessions.  
   
  Conference booklet, program and bags    
  A professional-looking DSAA conference brochure should be designed and printed for circulation to participants of DSAA each year. The booklet usually consists of the following sections: DSAA’20XX Agenda of a Glance, DSAA’20XX Chairs’ Welcome Message, Program Highlights (summary of keynote speeches, Research, and Application tracks, Special Sessions, Trends &Controversies Panel, Industry/Government Forum, Industry Invited Talks, Data Science School, Tutorials, and other features, etc.), DSAA’20XX Industry/Government Forum Program, DSAA’20XX Data Science School Program, DSAA’20XX Conference Program (detailed agenda of each conference day), DSAA’20XX Conference Organization (all committees), DSAA’20XX Sponsors and Supporters (tiers, logos, and names), Conference Venue and WiFi (floorplan, wifi password), Introduction to next year DSAA, and Useful Links and Emergency Contacts, etc.  
   
  The conference program should be updated to the conference website well before the conference opening. Accepted papers and tentative program may be uploaded to the conference website shortly after paper acceptance for the convenience of participants to prepare their travel and visa applications.  
   
  Conference bags are ordered and customized for each year of DSAAs. In addition to the conference booklet, the conference bags may hold other materials such as sponsors’ flyers and call for papers for the next year of DSAA. Materials to be placed into conference bags must receive permission from general chairs. Sponsor logos may be printed on the conference bags.  
   
  Exhibitions    
  Exhibitions may be organized to fulfill DSAA sponsorship requirements for sponsors to demonstrate their technologies and/or solutions, explore recruitment opportunities, and meet with current/future employees and clients. Exhibition booths may be assigned per sponsorship levels. Discussions with local organizers are suggested to arrange the exhibitions.  
   
  Invitation letters, travel support and participation certificate    
  Some participants may request invitation letters from DSAA local organizers for visa and travel applications while others may require a certificate of participation. Local organizers should clearly list the contact persons and the supporting documents requested from participants on the website and instantly issue the invitation letters.  
   
  Timetable display and adjustment notice board    
  Many hotels have TVs or screens that can be used to display DSAA daily program, timetable, adjustment, and notice. Adjustment of session rooms, paper presentation timeslots, cancellations, notices, etc. should be advertised to all participants through onsite notice board, onsite display screens, and social media, etc.  
   
  Roadmap and sign    
  Sometimes, it is not obvious for participants to find the session rooms and social program venues. A clear roadmap and signs should be arranged and placed at the critical points for guiding the traffic and transport. Instructions to the conference venue, hotels, and floorplan of the conference venue should be prepared and uploaded to the conference website and program booklet.  
   
  Computers, audio-video facilities and session time-keeping    
  The conference organizers should prepare one computer for each session for paper/speech presentations. Audio-video facilities should be arranged for presenters who may request such facilities. Time-keeping may be arranged to remind speakers to keep presentations on time.  
   
  Video-recording and photographing    
  Video-recording and photographing should be arranged by local organizers to record those important moments and activities in the conference, in particular, opening, keynote speeches, T&C talks, industry invited talks, tutorials, banquet, and group photos.  
   
  Session chairs and no-shows    
  Session chairs must be appointed by the PC chairs with their presence on time confirmed prior to the conference opening. Session chairs may be requested to be onsite 10 minutes before sessions start, collect all slides and presentations to a computer provided by the conference, and check whether all presenters are ready. Session chairs should also check and ensure the computer and projector provided are in good condition before sessions start. Chairs are responsible to maintain the schedule accurately and inform speakers of the time durations allocated to their talks and remaining time for discussions (usually 2 minutes or so). Please take note of "NO SHOW" presentations and inform the registration desk after your session, and contact volunteers, the registration desk, or PC chairs if there is an urgent matter. Please complete the “Session Report Sheet” from PC chairs and return it to the registration desk after the session to report issues and the status of the session. This sheet is highly important to check “NO SHOW” presentations and to ensure the quality and success of IEEE DSAAs.  
   
  Every paper needs to be orally presented by one of the authors or a nominated attendee. For session chairs, if the presenter of a paper is absent (“no-show”), please continue to the next presentation. Please check again at the end of the last presentation whether the “no-show” shows up. No show papers should be withdrawn before proceedings are finalized, or the authors MUST inform the PC chairs immediately if none of them can attend the conference due to unforeseen circumstances, otherwise, the conference should inform the authors' organizations of their absence.  
   
  Conference reception    
  The conference reception is usually organized in the evening of the first conference day, for example, from 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm. Refreshments and drinks are usually provided. Welcome speech may be delivered by local organizers and sponsors if any.  
   
  Conference opening ceremony    
  The conference opening ceremony is usually held in the morning of the first main conference day (or the second day if the first day is committed to industry events), for example, from 8.30 am to 9.00 am, right before the first keynote speech session. General chairs host the opening ceremony with a welcome from DSAA Steering Committee chair, brief statistics of submissions, review, and acceptance by PC chairs, a brief introduction to conference technical and social program, and logistics information by local arrangement chairs.  
   
  Conference banquet and award ceremony    
  The conference banquet is usually organized in the evening of the second main conference day. Gala dinner is usually provided. In addition to a brief summary of conference statistics and history, award ceremony, steering committee chair’s brief, introduction to the future DSAA conferences, entertaining performance is often arranged. Some organizers may prefer to have the award ceremony separated from the banquet rather organized in the first session of a conference day, for example, 8.30 am – 9.00 am.  
   
  Conference closing ceremony    
  The conference closing ceremony is organized right after the last session of the conference. General chairs host the closing ceremony, draw the conclusion and make appreciation, representatives from the next-year DSAA local organizers present a brief welcome. Refreshments and drinks may be offered.  
   
  Registration and financials  
 Every accepted paper MUST make at least one FULL regular registration (not student registrations) before the paper registration deadline given by the conference and MUST submit the camera-ready version before the camera-ready deadline to guarantee all papers to be included in the conference proceedings. Depending on the expenses at the conference city, DSAA suggests a full regular registration fee of approximately USD $600 (early bird) and a full student registration rate at about USD $400 (early bird) for a full-time student who can provide formal evidence of enrolment from the academic department. Full registration covers main tracks, tutorials, special sessions, and conference social programs. When Industry/Government Forum and Data Science School are organized, additional registrations may be separately required by package registration rates for everything or single rates for Forum or School to cover the relevant costs. When budget is permitted, local organizers may consider providing lunches and catering services including teas, reception, and banquet free of charge.  
   
  Job fair and matching  
 An item should be added to the conference website to introduce the DSAA job fair and matching program. DSAA hosts a website ( data science career center  ) for job seekers (graduates and professionals looking for jobs, students for internships) to meet with employers (representatives from companies and academia) and for job matching to match job seekers with employers before and during DSAA. Interested job seekers and employers should register for the job fair. DSAA will match-make the employers with seekers by providing job seekers' information to relevant employers.  
   
  Website  
 Once a conference bid success is confirmed, a website should be established as soon as possible before the conference kickoff. The website should be informative to cover aspects including key dates, calls for submissions, special sessions, tutorials, sponsorship, travel and NGDS awards, introduction to the conference venue and visa and travel arrangements, the organizing committee including Advisory and Steering committee with photos of all function chairs presented, guide and web links to submissions and camera-ready, accepted talks, papers and tutorials, and conference technical and social program. Contacts for general and specific inquiries should be provided.  
   
  A newsroom and social media channels should be set up on the front page of the website. Local organizers may refer to www.dsaa.co  and previous DSAA conference websites for relevant information.  
   
  DSAA social media accounts  
 DSAA has set up social media accounts, they are as follows:  
   
  Facebook: | www.facebook.com/ieeedsaa 
  LinkedIn: | https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=8393182 
  Twitter: | https://twitter.com/ieeedsaa 
  Google+: | https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ieeedsaa 
   
  These social media accounts should be placed on the top of the DSAA conference website's homepage.  
   
  You may consider adding the live update of Twitter and Facebook and a newsroom to the homepage of your conference website for live communications with an audience of interest. Local organizers, in particular local arrangement chairs, webmaster, social media chair, or publicity chairs, may use DSAA social media channels to instantly update the conference progress, key highlights, and notice to the communities.  
   
  Conference transfer meeting  
 A conference transfer meeting may be called and chaired by the steering committee chair in the current conference to transfer the experience from the current organizers to the next-year organizers. The meeting gathers all function chairs for the current conference and the next-year conference to share knowledge and experience and discuss questions and suggestions that may ensure the smooth operations of the next-year conference and the quality integrity between DSAA conferences. This is an important strategy for conference success, all function chairs should by all means attend this meeting.  
   
  4. How is IEEE DSAA governed?   
  
  DSAA is governed by the DSAA International Steering Committee, with advice from the Advisory Committee. The Steering Committee consists of recognized senior international researchers and practitioners distributed in representative countries and regions, representing different research areas and communities relevant to DSAA. Committee members take a voluntary job to give back to the community by driving the data science field, community, and capability building through DSAA.  
   
  Conference governance structure  
 The annual DSAA conference follows a governance structure as follows: a decision-making committee should be formed which usually consists of general chairs, PC chairs, local arrangement chairs, and the steering committee chair; 
  a monthly meeting should be organized by the lead general chair with the key function chairs to report the progress, issues and plan etc.;<\li> 
  Research and Application track PC chairs report to General Chairs who oversee the whole conference decision-making and operations; 
  technical function chairs such as tutorial and conference special session chairs are appointed by and report to Research PC chairs; 
  non-technical function chairs are appointed by and report to general chairs. 
   
  Annual steering committee meeting  
 An annual Advisory/Steering Committee meeting is hosted by the conference, usually after the conference reception in the first evening. The conference organizers should prepare a meeting room with dinner and presentation facilities. Guests from the current, previous, and future conferences will be invited by the Committee chair.  
   
  The meeting consists of two parts: an open session and a closed session. In the open session, the Committee chair opens and welcomes participants to the meeting, followed by a report from previous conferences including financial reports, an update on the current conference, presentations for future conferences, and general discussions. In the closes session, the Committee reviews the reports, addresses issues identified, makes strategic discussions and planning, and makes decisions regarding future conferences and membership. The Committee will discuss whether new members should be appointed into the Advisory/Steering Committees.  
   
  Conference reporting to steering committee  
 The next-year DSAA conference is kicked off when the current conference closes. The DSAA conference general chairs, local arrangement chairs, and other relevant chairs have regular progress and review teleconference meetings with the steering committee chair bi-monthly or monthly per need. The meeting may discuss strategies and initiatives suggested by the steering committee.  
   
  Advisory committee  
 The Advisory Committee is to provide high level and strategic guide and future directions to the Steering Committee and conference organizers, to ensure DSAA to reach its strategic goal as a flagship in the data science and analytics domain and the long-term goal of substantially promoting the building of data science and analytics field, community, capabilities and best practice. The Advisory Committee members are not required to attend the annual conference.  
   
  Please add the members of the current Advisory Committee  to your conference website.  
   
  Steering committee  
 The Steering Committee takes the leadership of ensuring the quality, impact, credibility, and integrity of DSAA conferences. The Committee appoints general chairs and program chairs for each year of conferences, selects host organizations, and provides oversight and guidance to the operations of the conferences. The Committee takes strategic efforts to enlarge the impact and engagement of DSAA internationally towards an inter-disciplinary, cross-domain, and cross-academia and business direction. The Committee takes strategic decisions to support and build emerging, disadvantaged and under-represented areas and regions.  
   
  Given the important responsibilities taken by the Committee especially in the annual Committee meeting hosted by the current conference, members are required to attend the annual conference. Existing membership may be adjusted based on the actual engagement and contributions to DSAA through the annual Committee meeting, with new members invited who contribute significantly to DSAA.  
   
  Please add the members of the current Steering Committee  to your conference website.

 DASS Profile  
 DSAA has been competitively ranked in various ranking systems including CORE, CCF and Google Metrics, it is ranked A in CORE.  
 The DSAA conference was initially established in 2014, jointly technically sponsored by IEEE and ACM. Since 2015, DSAA has been fully sponsored by IEEE, becoming an IEEE conference, and co-sponsored by ACM, in addition to sponsorship from IEEE Big Data Initiative. In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) officially started to sponsor DSAA; DSAA becomes the only data science event that is jointly sponsored by ACM, IEEE and ASA.  
 DSAA’2024 is held in San Diego, United States (Oct 6th-10th, 2024); DSAA’2023 in Thessaloniki, Greece (9-13 Oct, 2023); DSAA’2022 online (October 13-16, 2022); DSAA’2021 in Porto, Portugal (6-9 Oct 2021); DSAA’2020 in Sydney, Australia (6-9 Oct 2020); DSAA’2019 in Washington DC, USA (5-8 Oct 2019); DSAA’2018 in Turin, Italy (1-4 Oct 2018); DSAA’2017 in Tokyo, Japan (19-21 Oct 2017); DSAA’2016 in Montreal, Canada (17-19 Oct 2016); IEEE DSAA’2015 in Paris, France (19-21 Oct 2015); and DSAA’2014 in Shanghai, China (30 Oct-1 Nov, 2014), with over 200 participants from over 40 countries.  
 DSAA has firmly established itself as the premier forum in the area of data science, big data, advanced analytics, statistics, and machine learning for industry, government and academic participants. This is ensured by such features as a very competitive acceptance rate (about 10%) for regular papers, high profile core function chairs, 10 pages in IEEE double-column format by double-blind review, interdisciplinary and cross-domain engagement from statistics, industry, and government. The conferences hold three main tracks: Research, Applications, and Special Session tracks, in addition to the first day as the industry day, data science school, student poster sessions, and industry poster sessions. DSAA features unique values and activities, including the Trends & Controversies session, and the Invited Industry Talks session, to promote the development of data science, and encourage dialogue across disciplines and industry and academia. DSAA also have common activities, such as plenary keynote talks, panel sessions, associated tutorials, and social events.

 DSN-2025: Research Track Call For Contributions   
 Society is increasingly dependent on the robust functioning of all types of computing systems. These systems include mobile/edge devices, networks, personal computers, and large-scale systems and critical infrastructures that provide services we use in our everyday lives for many applications and problems. Failure, incorrect operation, or compromise of computing systems and networks can have dire implications for the safety and security of human and other lives and the environment.  
 The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is devoted to the mission of ensuring that the computing systems and networks on which society relies are robust, i.e., dependable and secure.  
 DSN, one of the longest-running IEEE conferences organizing its 55th edition in 2025, has pioneered the fusion between dependability and security research under a common body of knowledge, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional (malicious) attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. Its distinctive approach to both accidental faults and malicious attacks has made DSN the most prestigious international forum for presenting research that pushes the boundaries in the robustness and resilience of a wide spectrum of computing systems and networks.  
 All aspects of research and practice of computer system robustness (i.e., dependability and security) are within the scope of DSN. Relevant topics include but are not limited to: 1) innovative systems, architectures, protocols, and algorithms for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, eliminating, or recovering from accidental and malicious threats as well as 2) practical experimentation with and assessment of the robustness (dependability and security) of all types of computing systems and networks.  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers on all topics within this broad scope. Example topical areas include but are not limited to the following:  
 Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, memory systems, systems on chip, I/O devices, storage systems, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), edge and mobile devices, data center infrastructure, hardware accelerators, emerging technologies, emerging paradigms like processing in memory & quantum computing) 
  Software (e.g., applications, middleware, distributed algorithms, operating systems, software security, dependable software design) 
  Networked systems and clouds (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, edge computing, cloud computing/storage, networks on chip, network security) 
  Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, assured autonomy, explainable decision-making, acceptability, privacy issues) 
  Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, real-time control of critical systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, railway, medical systems, security and safety of cyber-physical systems) 
  Distributed ledgers/Blockchain (e.g., BFT/consensus algorithms, cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proofs) 
  AI/Machine Learning for resilient systems (e.g., robust, resilient, secure, and explainable AI/Machine Learning techniques; applications of AI/ML techniques for dependability and security, robustness issues in AI/ML systems) 
  Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and assessing robust (dependable and secure) systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis) 
  Emerging technologies and computing paradigms (e.g., robustness, security, dependability issues of emerging memory and storage systems, emerging computing paradigms like quantum computing, processing in memory/sensors/storage/network, 3-dimensional architectures, new hardware/software cooperative paradigms, emerging programming and system paradigms)

 Information to authors   
 Innovative papers in all areas of robust (dependable and secure) systems and networks will be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference broadly and inclusively favors innovative and insightful research that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art systems. Submissions will be judged on insight, originality, significance, correctness, and potential impact.  
 Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2025, if accepted.  
 All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions.  
 At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work in person.  
 Paper Categories   
 When submitting, authors have to select one of the following categories:  
 Regular papers (11 pages)   : a full paper describing a research contribution, including experimental work focused on implementation and evaluation of existing techniques in the DSN thematic areas. Papers should clearly describe a novel scientific contribution and a significant advancement of the state of knowledge in DSN-relevant topics. The paper should address a significant problem with a compelling solution whose validity and practical applicability are clearly discussed.  
 Practical experience reports (7 pages)   : a shorter paper describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and techniques to real-world problems and systems, or based on the empirical analysis of field data using a rigorous scientific approach. A paper in this category is expected to show new insights and experiences informing the research and practice of robust computing system design. Contributions reporting on industry practical experiences and lessons learned are highly encouraged, including studies reporting negative results or challenges about the practical applicability or scalability of research results in industry.  
 Tool descriptions/demonstrations (7 pages)   : descriptions of the architecture, implementation, and usage of substantive tools to aid the research and practice of dependability. A tool paper is expected to describe and demonstrate the value that the tool brings to the dependability community. Making the tool publicly available, whenever possible, is strongly encouraged.  
 The number of pages indicated above includes everything: title page, text, figures, appendices  , etc. Only references are not included in the page limit. Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review  .  
 Independently of the paper category, we expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results and encourage authors, whenever possible, to make both the artifacts and datasets related to the paper publicly available.  
  
 Artifacts   
 DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. DSN 2025 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track that is open to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools.  
 At the time of the submission, authors must indicate (1) whether they intend to submit an artifact for their submission, (2) the type of artifact (code, dataset, or both), (3) a DOI reserved for the artifact on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare), and (4) the badge(s) they are applying for. For more information about how to reserve a DOI and about the three choices available for the badges, see the Call for Artifacts on the DSN’25 website  .  
 Information about the artifact submission will not be shared with the PC. The artifact does not need to be submitted at the same time as the paper. The artifact can be uploaded at the reserved DOI after the paper submission deadline and can be updated until the artifact submission deadline.  
 The artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a single-blind review process, where authors should be available to respond quickly during the artifact evaluation. All artifacts submitted will compete for a “Distinguished Artifact Award” to be decided by that committee.  
 Anonymization Rules   
 Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. An author should always refer to their own related work in the third person, just like they would refer to any other related work. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments).  
 Anonymization should not be done in a way to hurt the review process. For example, omitting published references or anonymizing them for the purposes of a double-blind process can significantly hurt the review process. As such, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. For example, a paper on experiences with the design of .NET should not be rewritten to be about "an anonymous but widely used commercial distributed systems platform."  
 Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. Avoid names that could in any way be interpreted as being derived from the name of an author or identifying an author’s location or affiliation. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own previously published work. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: “Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2021].” with the corresponding citation: “[Anonymous 2021] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.” This is, for example, the case for extended versions of the paper available online. 
  If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chair in a separate email. 
   
 Authors should also avoid broadly advertising their work in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it (for example, presentations in small meetings or seminars are allowed). It is unacceptable to discuss the work with program committee members. Posting the work on ArXiV or a similar site is within the authors’ rights; however, the authors should use a different title than the submission and they should avoid specifying that the work is under submission to DSN. In particular, please ensure that there are not older versions of the paper on ArXiV that have the same title as the submission.  
 Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization, and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded  .  
 Formatting Rules   
 Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society camera-ready 8.5″x11″ two-column camera-ready format (using a 10-point font on 12-point single-spaced leading) as implemented by the LaTeX/Word templates available at the IEEE conference template  page (last updated in 2019):  
 LaTex Package ( ZIP  )  
 Word Template ( DOC  )  
 Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded in the file. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations, etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of acceptance. Please take a note of the following:  
 Submissions should be anonymous. 
  The page limit includes everything except references. 
  The first page must include the title of the paper, the type of the paper (Regular / Practical Experience / Tool), and a maximum 150-word abstract. 
  Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers: describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them. If the title and abstract are not sufficiently descriptive at the time of the abstract deadline, the submission may be rejected without review. 
  The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (and thus has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. 
  There is no page limit for references - however, authors must not put any text or figures on the pages for the references - if so, those pages will be included in the page limits above (it is acceptable for the references to start on the last page of the paper as long as it is within the page limit). 
  Pages should be numbered. 
  The use of color for figures and graphs is encouraged, but the paper should be easily readable if printed in grayscale. 
  Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. 
  Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB. 
   
 Paper Submissions   
 Papers are submitted via the submission website: https://dsn25.hotcrp.com  .  
 The program committee will perform a double-blind review of all submissions, with help from outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.  
 Authors must anonymize their submissions (see Anonymization Rules). Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.  
 Awards   
 DSN gives three Best Paper Awards and one of them, based on the quality of the oral presentation, will also receive a Distinguished Best Paper Award. All of them will be presented in a special Best Paper Session at the conference.  
 The selection of the candidate papers for the awards is carried out as a three-step process. First, the Program Committee picks 6-7 of the accepted papers based on the review and revision process & committee discussion. Second, the Steering Committee (in consultation with the Program Chairs) chooses among these papers the 3 Best Papers that are to be presented in the Best Paper Session at the conference (all these papers receive the Best Paper Award). Third, and finally, the audience at the conference votes among these Best Papers to select the one that should receive the Distinguished Best Paper Award. Attendees are strongly encouraged to read the Best Papers as well as carefully listen to their presentations, and make their Distinguished Best Paper Award choice based on all information they have about the finalized Best Papers and their presentations at the conference.  
 DSN also attributes a group of awards based on nominations. These awards are the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability, the Rising Star in Dependability Award, the Test-of-Time Award, and the Jean-Claude Laprie Award. Please check the relevant page on the DSN website for additional details.  
 As noted above, there will also be a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Review Process and Author Response   
 This year, as initiated in DSN 2023, in addition to the rebuttal process, DSN is following a Paper Revision Process  . For papers that are not early rejects, the authors will be invited to submit a revised paper (as well as a rebuttal) after receiving their reviews. The major goal of the revision process is twofold:  
 1. to strengthen the papers by making sure reviewer comments are properly addressed in a revised version; and 
  2. to enable the reviewers to see how their comments are addressed in a revised version (which is especially useful in cases where rebuttal may not have the same effect). 
  Through this process, we give the authors the ability to submit both a revised paper (based on the received reviews) and a rebuttal. These two serve different purposes. In particular, the rebuttal remains useful for at least three purposes that cannot be easily accomplished with a revised paper:  
 1. to clarify misunderstandings (and point out any other issues) in the reviews; 
  2. to describe a plan for revisions the author would like to make but need more time for than the revision timeframe allows; and 
  3. to provide a summary of changes that helps the authors to describe how they addressed the reviewer comments in the revised paper. 
  The authors of all papers that are invited for revision will be allowed one extra page to properly address reviewer comments. In other words, the revised (and, if accepted, the final) versions of papers will be allowed 12 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for practical experience reports or tool descriptions/demonstrations. The authors will be asked to mark and describe all the changes they made to the submission during the revision process. More information will be provided to authors of papers who are asked to provide a revision as to how to prepare, format, and submit the revised version of the submission. Note that submitting a revised paper does not guarantee acceptance of the paper to the conference and all revised papers will be reviewed and discussed by the Program Committee.  
 To limit the load on the reviewers, the rebuttal will be strictly limited to 750 words. Any attempt to provide extra information, for example by including images in the rebuttal, will cause the rebuttal material to be discarded.  
 DSN will continue to employ the Early Rejection Notification Policy  . Papers that are rejected in the first reviewing round will receive their rejection notification and reviews by January 27, 2025. As such, the authors may get started earlier on improving their manuscript for a future submission, if they wish to do so.  
 All accepted papers will be subject to the revision and approval of a PC member acting as a shepherd.  
 Open Science Policy   
 After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports the adoption of open source and open data principles and encourages all authors to make their prototypes available to the research community and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Accepted papers can participate in the artifact evaluation process described above.  
 Ethical considerations   
 Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g., by following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.  
 Contact the program co-chairs dsn25pcchairs@gmail.com  if you have any questions.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived conflict to the PC chairs.  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion concerning the paper.  
 Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members   
 To avoid potential bias, the DSN Program Committee Co-Chairs are not allowed to (co-)author any submission to the conference. There are no such restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members including the General chairs since double-blind anonymization rules and conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the processes related to the technical program including the selection of the PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing, and acceptance of papers.

49. Conference DSN_2:
DSN-2025: Research Track Call For Contributions   
 Society is increasingly dependent on the robust functioning of all types of computing systems. These systems include mobile/edge devices, networks, personal computers, and large-scale systems and critical infrastructures that provide services we use in our everyday lives for many applications and problems. Failure, incorrect operation, or compromise of computing systems and networks can have dire implications for the safety and security of human and other lives and the environment.  
 The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is devoted to the mission of ensuring that the computing systems and networks on which society relies are robust, i.e., dependable and secure.  
 DSN, one of the longest-running IEEE conferences organizing its 55th edition in 2025, has pioneered the fusion between dependability and security research under a common body of knowledge, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional (malicious) attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. Its distinctive approach to both accidental faults and malicious attacks has made DSN the most prestigious international forum for presenting research that pushes the boundaries in the robustness and resilience of a wide spectrum of computing systems and networks.  
 All aspects of research and practice of computer system robustness (i.e., dependability and security) are within the scope of DSN. Relevant topics include but are not limited to: 1) innovative systems, architectures, protocols, and algorithms for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, eliminating, or recovering from accidental and malicious threats as well as 2) practical experimentation with and assessment of the robustness (dependability and security) of all types of computing systems and networks.  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers on all topics within this broad scope. Example topical areas include but are not limited to the following:  
 Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, memory systems, systems on chip, I/O devices, storage systems, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), edge and mobile devices, data center infrastructure, hardware accelerators, emerging technologies, emerging paradigms like processing in memory & quantum computing) 
  Software (e.g., applications, middleware, distributed algorithms, operating systems, software security, dependable software design) 
  Networked systems and clouds (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, edge computing, cloud computing/storage, networks on chip, network security) 
  Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, assured autonomy, explainable decision-making, acceptability, privacy issues) 
  Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, real-time control of critical systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, railway, medical systems, security and safety of cyber-physical systems) 
  Distributed ledgers/Blockchain (e.g., BFT/consensus algorithms, cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proofs) 
  AI/Machine Learning for resilient systems (e.g., robust, resilient, secure, and explainable AI/Machine Learning techniques; applications of AI/ML techniques for dependability and security, robustness issues in AI/ML systems) 
  Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and assessing robust (dependable and secure) systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis) 
  Emerging technologies and computing paradigms (e.g., robustness, security, dependability issues of emerging memory and storage systems, emerging computing paradigms like quantum computing, processing in memory/sensors/storage/network, 3-dimensional architectures, new hardware/software cooperative paradigms, emerging programming and system paradigms)

 Information to authors   
 Innovative papers in all areas of robust (dependable and secure) systems and networks will be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference broadly and inclusively favors innovative and insightful research that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art systems. Submissions will be judged on insight, originality, significance, correctness, and potential impact.  
 Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2025, if accepted.  
 All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions.  
 At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work in person.  
 Paper Categories   
 When submitting, authors have to select one of the following categories:  
 Regular papers (11 pages)   : a full paper describing a research contribution, including experimental work focused on implementation and evaluation of existing techniques in the DSN thematic areas. Papers should clearly describe a novel scientific contribution and a significant advancement of the state of knowledge in DSN-relevant topics. The paper should address a significant problem with a compelling solution whose validity and practical applicability are clearly discussed.  
 Practical experience reports (7 pages)   : a shorter paper describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and techniques to real-world problems and systems, or based on the empirical analysis of field data using a rigorous scientific approach. A paper in this category is expected to show new insights and experiences informing the research and practice of robust computing system design. Contributions reporting on industry practical experiences and lessons learned are highly encouraged, including studies reporting negative results or challenges about the practical applicability or scalability of research results in industry.  
 Tool descriptions/demonstrations (7 pages)   : descriptions of the architecture, implementation, and usage of substantive tools to aid the research and practice of dependability. A tool paper is expected to describe and demonstrate the value that the tool brings to the dependability community. Making the tool publicly available, whenever possible, is strongly encouraged.  
 The number of pages indicated above includes everything: title page, text, figures, appendices  , etc. Only references are not included in the page limit. Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review  .  
 Independently of the paper category, we expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results and encourage authors, whenever possible, to make both the artifacts and datasets related to the paper publicly available.  
  
 Artifacts   
 DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. DSN 2025 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track that is open to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools.  
 At the time of the submission, authors must indicate (1) whether they intend to submit an artifact for their submission, (2) the type of artifact (code, dataset, or both), (3) a DOI reserved for the artifact on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare), and (4) the badge(s) they are applying for. For more information about how to reserve a DOI and about the three choices available for the badges, see the Call for Artifacts on the DSN’25 website  .  
 Information about the artifact submission will not be shared with the PC. The artifact does not need to be submitted at the same time as the paper. The artifact can be uploaded at the reserved DOI after the paper submission deadline and can be updated until the artifact submission deadline.  
 The artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a single-blind review process, where authors should be available to respond quickly during the artifact evaluation. All artifacts submitted will compete for a “Distinguished Artifact Award” to be decided by that committee.  
 Anonymization Rules   
 Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. An author should always refer to their own related work in the third person, just like they would refer to any other related work. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments).

 DSN also attributes a group of awards based on nominations. These awards are the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability, the Rising Star in Dependability Award, the Test-of-Time Award, and the Jean-Claude Laprie Award. Please check the relevant page on the DSN website for additional details.  
 As noted above, there will also be a Distinguished Artifact Award.  
 Review Process and Author Response   
 This year, as initiated in DSN 2023, in addition to the rebuttal process, DSN is following a Paper Revision Process  . For papers that are not early rejects, the authors will be invited to submit a revised paper (as well as a rebuttal) after receiving their reviews. The major goal of the revision process is twofold:  
 1. to strengthen the papers by making sure reviewer comments are properly addressed in a revised version; and 
  2. to enable the reviewers to see how their comments are addressed in a revised version (which is especially useful in cases where rebuttal may not have the same effect). 
  Through this process, we give the authors the ability to submit both a revised paper (based on the received reviews) and a rebuttal. These two serve different purposes. In particular, the rebuttal remains useful for at least three purposes that cannot be easily accomplished with a revised paper:  
 1. to clarify misunderstandings (and point out any other issues) in the reviews; 
  2. to describe a plan for revisions the author would like to make but need more time for than the revision timeframe allows; and 
  3. to provide a summary of changes that helps the authors to describe how they addressed the reviewer comments in the revised paper. 
  The authors of all papers that are invited for revision will be allowed one extra page to properly address reviewer comments. In other words, the revised (and, if accepted, the final) versions of papers will be allowed 12 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for practical experience reports or tool descriptions/demonstrations. The authors will be asked to mark and describe all the changes they made to the submission during the revision process. More information will be provided to authors of papers who are asked to provide a revision as to how to prepare, format, and submit the revised version of the submission. Note that submitting a revised paper does not guarantee acceptance of the paper to the conference and all revised papers will be reviewed and discussed by the Program Committee.  
 To limit the load on the reviewers, the rebuttal will be strictly limited to 750 words. Any attempt to provide extra information, for example by including images in the rebuttal, will cause the rebuttal material to be discarded.  
 DSN will continue to employ the Early Rejection Notification Policy  . Papers that are rejected in the first reviewing round will receive their rejection notification and reviews by January 27, 2025. As such, the authors may get started earlier on improving their manuscript for a future submission, if they wish to do so.  
 All accepted papers will be subject to the revision and approval of a PC member acting as a shepherd.  
 Open Science Policy   
 After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports the adoption of open source and open data principles and encourages all authors to make their prototypes available to the research community and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Accepted papers can participate in the artifact evaluation process described above.  
 Ethical considerations   
 Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g., by following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.  
 Contact the program co-chairs dsn25pcchairs@gmail.com  if you have any questions.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived conflict to the PC chairs.  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion concerning the paper.  
 Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members   
 To avoid potential bias, the DSN Program Committee Co-Chairs are not allowed to (co-)author any submission to the conference. There are no such restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members including the General chairs since double-blind anonymization rules and conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the processes related to the technical program including the selection of the PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing, and acceptance of papers.  
 Program Committee Co-Chairs   
 Patrick P. C. Lee, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong  
  Saman Zonouz, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA
