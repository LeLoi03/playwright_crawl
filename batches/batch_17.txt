 The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields. We invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including but not limited to the following:  
 Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio, Creative AI) 
  Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks, foundation models, LLMs) 
  Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop) 
  General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.) 
  Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions) 
  Machine learning for sciences (e.g. climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences) 
  Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces) 
  Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust) 
  Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes) 
  Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics) 
  Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior) 
  Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory) 
  Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and so we welcome interdisciplinary submissions that do not fit neatly into existing categories.  
 Authors are asked to confirm that their submissions accord with the NeurIPS code of conduct   .  
 Formatting instructions:  All submissions must be in PDF format, and in a single PDF file include, in this order:  
 The submitted paper 
  Technical appendices that support the paper with additional proofs, derivations, or results 
  The NeurIPS paper checklist 
  Other supplementary materials such as data and code can be uploaded as a ZIP file  
 The main text of a submitted paper is limited to nine content pages  , including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references don’t count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version.  
 The main text and references may be followed by technical appendices, for which there is no page limit.  
 The maximum file size for a full submission, which includes technical appendices, is 50MB.  
 Authors are encouraged to submit a separate ZIP file that contains further supplementary material like data or source code, when applicable.  
 You must format your submission using the NeurIPS 2024 LaTeX style file     which includes a “preprint” option for non-anonymous preprints posted online. Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. Papers may be rejected without consideration of their merits if they fail to meet the submission requirements, as described in this document.  
 Paper checklist:  In order to improve the rigor and transparency of research submitted to and published at NeurIPS, authors are required to complete a paper checklist   . The paper checklist is intended to help authors reflect on a wide variety of issues relating to responsible machine learning research, including reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. The checklist forms part of the paper submission, but does not count towards the page limit.  
 Please join the NeurIPS 2024 Checklist Assistant Study that will provide you with free verification of your checklist performed by an LLM here  . Please see details in our blog   
  
 Supplementary material:  While all technical appendices should be included as part of the main paper submission PDF, authors may submit up to 100MB of supplementary material, such as data, or source code in a ZIP format. Supplementary material should be material created by the authors that directly supports the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.  
 We encourage authors to upload their code and data as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work. Check the policy   as well as code submission guidelines and templates   for further details.  
 Use of Large Language Models (LLMs):  We welcome authors to use any tool that is suitable for preparing high-quality papers and research. However, we ask authors to keep in mind two important criteria. First, we expect papers to fully describe their methodology, and any tool that is important to that methodology, including the use of LLMs, should be described also. For example, authors should mention tools (including LLMs) that were used for data processing or filtering, visualization, facilitating or running experiments, and proving theorems. It may also be advisable to describe the use of LLMs in implementing the method (if this corresponds to an important, original, or non-standard component of the approach). Second, authors are responsible for the entire content of the paper, including all text and figures, so while authors are welcome to use any tool they wish for writing the paper, they must ensure that all text is correct and original.  
 Double-blind reviewing:  All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code. If you are including links to any external material, it is your responsibility to guarantee anonymous browsing. Please do not include acknowledgements at submission time. If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. For instance, write “In the previous work of Smith et al. [1]…” rather than “In our previous work [1]...”). If you need to cite one of your own papers that is in submission to NeurIPS and not available as a non-anonymous preprint, then include a copy of the cited anonymized submission in the supplementary material and write “Anonymous et al. [1] concurrently show...”). Any papers found to be violating this policy will be rejected.  
 OpenReview:  We are using OpenReview to manage submissions. The reviews and author responses will not be public initially (but may be made public later, see below). As in previous years, submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned program committee. We will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. Your OpenReview profile can be edited by logging in and clicking on your name in https://openreview.net/   . This takes you to a URL "https://openreview.net/profile?id=~[Firstname]_[Lastname][n]" where the last part is your profile name, e.g., ~Wei_Zhang1. The OpenReview profiles must be up to date, with all publications by the authors, and their current affiliations. The easiest way to import publications is through DBLP but it is not required, see FAQ   . Submissions without updated OpenReview profiles will be desk rejected. The information entered in the profile is critical for ensuring that conflicts of interest   and reviewer matching are handled properly. Because of the rapid growth of NeurIPS, we request that all authors help with reviewing papers, if asked to do so. We need everyone’s help in maintaining the high scientific quality of NeurIPS.  
 Please be aware that OpenReview has a moderation policy for newly created profiles: New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.  
 Venue home page: https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference   
 If you have any questions, please refer to the FAQ: https://openreview.net/faq  
 Abstract Submission:  There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline on May 15, 2024, six days before full paper submissions are due. While it will be possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts that are rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. This includes titles and abstracts that either provide little or no semantic information (e.g., "We provide a new semi-supervised learning method.") or describe a substantively different claimed contribution. The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline. After that, authors may be reordered, but any additions or removals must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Ethics review:  Reviewers and ACs may flag submissions for ethics review   . Flagged submissions will be sent to an ethics review committee for comments. Comments from ethics reviewers will be considered by the primary reviewers and AC as part of their deliberation. They will also be visible to authors, who will have an opportunity to respond. Ethics reviewers do not have the authority to reject papers, but in extreme cases papers may be rejected by the program chairs on ethical grounds, regardless of scientific quality or contribution.  
 Preprints:  The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection. If you choose to use the NeurIPS style for the preprint version, you must use the “preprint” option rather than the “final” option. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit anonymized work to NeurIPS that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it. Note that public versions of the submission should not say "Under review at NeurIPS" or similar.  
 Dual submissions:  Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS. Papers previously presented at workshops are permitted, so long as they did not appear in a conference proceedings (e.g., CVPRW proceedings), a journal or a book. NeurIPS coordinates with other conferences to identify dual submissions. The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions applies for the entire duration of the reviewing process. Slicing contributions too thinly is discouraged. The reviewing process will treat any other submission by an overlapping set of authors as prior work. If publishing one would render the other too incremental, both may be rejected.  
 Anti-collusion:  NeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews.  
 Author responses:  Authors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. Author responses may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. Authors may not submit revisions of their paper or supplemental material, but may post their responses as a discussion in OpenReview. This is to reduce the burden on authors to have to revise their paper in a rush during the short rebuttal period.  
 After the initial response period, authors will be able to respond to any further reviewer/AC questions and comments by posting on the submission’s forum page. The program chairs reserve the right to solicit additional reviews after the initial author response period. These reviews will become visible to the authors as they are added to OpenReview, and authors will have a chance to respond to them.  
 After the notification deadline, accepted and opted-in rejected papers will be made public and open for non-anonymous public commenting. Their anonymous reviews, meta-reviews, author responses and reviewer responses will also be made public. Authors of rejected papers will have two weeks after the notification deadline to opt in to make their deanonymized rejected papers public in OpenReview. These papers are not counted as NeurIPS publications and will be shown as rejected in OpenReview.  
 Publication of accepted submissions:  Reviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference. All camera-ready papers must include a funding disclosure   . We strongly encourage accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers when appropriate, as per the code submission policy   . Authors will be allowed to make minor changes for a short period of time after the conference.  
 Contemporaneous Work:  For the purpose of the reviewing process, papers that appeared online within two months of a submission will generally be considered "contemporaneous" in the sense that the submission will not be rejected on the basis of the comparison to contemporaneous work. Authors are still expected to cite and discuss contemporaneous work and perform empirical comparisons to the degree feasible. Any paper that influenced the submission is considered prior work and must be cited and discussed as such. Submissions that are very similar to contemporaneous work will undergo additional scrutiny to prevent cases of plagiarism and missing credit to prior work.  
 Plagiarism is prohibited by the NeurIPS Code of Conduct   .  
 Other Tracks:  Similarly to earlier years, we will host multiple tracks, such as datasets, competitions, tutorials as well as workshops, in addition to the main track for which this call for papers is intended. See the conference homepage   for updates and calls for participation in these tracks.  
 Experiments:  As in past years, the program chairs will be measuring the quality and effectiveness of the review process via randomized controlled experiments. All experiments are independently reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
 Financial Aid:  Each paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected. To be considered for Financial the student will also need to fill out the Financial Aid application when it becomes available.

 Title: Quality Management and Sustainability in Video Streaming 
  Speaker: Prof. Luigi Atzori (University of Cagliari) 
  Abstract: The constant increase in the amount of video traffic generated by major streaming platforms and video calling sessions, combined with users' high-quality expectations, places strong demands on proposing procedures for managing resources in the network and on the server side. These procedures should take into account both the quality perceived by the user and the environmental impact. This talk will touch on these two topics, starting by illustrating recent studies regarding the development of models focused on defining personalized quality prediction solutions to consider the individual and personal differences of users. The use of user facial and speech-related features for estimating the QoE (Quality of Experience) of multimedia services is presented, with a particular focus on WebRTC-based video conferencing. The resulting prediction systems can be used to find an appropriate trade-off between quality of experience and sustainability. As a result, it is important to study the impact of different service settings (e.g., video resolution, different luminance types, and different end devices) on both the QoE and the power consumption of video streaming services.

 NOSSDAV is a workshop with a long-standing tradition focusing on both emerging and established multimedia systems research topics especially high-risk/high-return ideas. The single-track format brings together academic and industry researchers and practitioners to engage in fruitful and constructive discussions. NOSSDAV encourages papers identifying fundamental open problems in multimedia systems research, advocate new radical ideas or offer counterarguments or critique on the existing state of the art; NOSSDAV prefers exciting-even-if-incomplete papers or reports on promising ideas that may be supported by well-reasoned arguments. NOSSDAV takes a broad perspective on all areas of multimedia systems. Authors are especially encouraged to submit papers with real-world experimental results and datasets. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to): Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and immersive systems Deep learning approaches to improve multimedia delivery and processing Cloud architectures for multimedia coding and processing Wireless, mobile, IoT and embedded systems for multimedia applications Medical, surveillance and autonomous driving multimedia systems Network-distributed media processing Networked GPUs/TPUs, graphics and virtual environments Audio/Image/Video Analytics Systems System Support for Multimedia Interaction with humans Internet-Scale Multimedia Systems  Last updated by Lu Jing  in 2024-01-11

 Papers  

 Research Paper   
 We invite papers in all areas of Human-Computer Interaction, and welcome the submission of papers that advances theory, methodology, technology or practice of relevance to Human-Computer Interaction research. Submitted work must be original and not accepted for publication or published elsewhere.   
 We welcome both longer papers that require more space to present their contribution, and short papers that present significant advances concisely. Since pictorials is not a separate submission category for NordiCHI 2024, submissions that rely extensively on visual communication are also welcome.   
 The theme of the NordiCHI 2024 conference is  live   . We live in a world which is increasingly divided, and the theme inspires us to think about how distances as well as diversities can be bridged. The theme inspires us to think about the changing and diverse living conditions for us as researchers, for IT users, and diverse communities around the globe, and it encourages us to explore complex issues related to sustainability and the living conditions for not just humans but entire ecologies. We encourage authors to submit research papers that broadly contribute to the theme of  live   within HCI research, but  we welcome a broad range of topics in the general HCI scope, including research contributions that have as their primary aim to instill reflection, provoke discussion, and build bridges across schools of thinking.   
  
 Submission Instructions and Schedule   
 Submissions should use the ACM master article template in single-column format, Templates and instructions for submission are found   here   .

  Selection process   
 Research papers are subject to a double-blind peer review process. Submissions in the research paper category must be appropriately anonymized to conceal the authors’ identities and institutions, see submission instructions for details.   
 Submitted contributions will be peer reviewed by 2 external reviewers and the 2AC from the program committee. Note that notifications are final, there is no second review cycle or rebuttal process in place.   
 For readability reasons, the maximum length is restricted to 10000 words not including references. Note that the length of a submission should reflect its contribution, and that shorter submissions are welcome.   
 Accepted submissions to the NordiCHI paper track are considered archival and made available through the ACM digital library.  
 Upon acceptance, you will be invited to present your paper at the conference. Onsite, we can generally provide a projector and screen. Additional technical requirements must be discussed with the chairs. It is also possible to present papers as part of the NordiCHI’24 online program.

 Please address questions regarding a specific symposium or a SAC symposium track to the respective symposium co-chairs or the SAC symposium track chairs listed on the conference website.  
 Please make sure to follow the Author and Submission Guidelines listed below.  
 IEEE ICC 2025 will feature a series of half and full-day workshops. The aim of the conference workshops is to emphasize emerging topics that are not specifically covered in the main symposia. Each workshop may include a mix of regular papers, invited presentations, keynotes and panels that encourage the participation of attendees in active discussion.

  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 All papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE: To be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted workshop paper is required to register for the conference at the “Workshop Registration” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
   
  During the initial paper submission process, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on th paper registration page. In particular, the paper registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 IMPORTANT:  
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.  
 You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.

 Introduction  
   
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the utilization of computer systems to analyze, comprehend, and generate human languages. This encompasses various inputs such as text, spoken language, or keyboard interactions. Its functions range from translation between languages, comprehending and representing text content, constructing databases, generating summaries, to facilitating dialogues with users for information retrieval. NLP has become an integral part of people's lives, pervading various domains including entertainment, healthcare, databases, and e-governance.  
 The ICNLP conference serves as a global platform for the exchange of innovative ideas, bringing together researchers, students, developers, and practitioners interested in the realm of Natural Language Processing.  
   
  Scheduled from March 21st to March 23rd, 2025, ICNLP 2025, the 7th International Conference on Natural Language Processing, will take place in Guangzhou, China. This event is mainly sponsored by Guangdong University of Finance and Economics, supported by National Community of Key Data Elements for Industry-Education Harmonization, Guangzhou College of Commerce, and some universities and institutions.

 Submission Guidelines  
 The technical program committee welcomes paper submissions on all topics related to computer and communication networks. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind peer review, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers and the identities of reviewers are withheld from the authors. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing reviewers to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.  
 Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered. Submitted papers should be written in English by following the IEEE conference format, with a maximum length limit of 9 printed pages  , including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. Each paper can be accompanied by an appendix of at most 2 pages. However, the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. The appendix is included in the 9 page limit  .  
 All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS:  
  https://edas.info/N31469    
 When submitting a paper, its title, all co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the metadata of the paper. The program committee may ask some authors to shorten their paper to a short paper of 3 pages to be presented in a poster session, instead of a plenary session.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper.  
 To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review. Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the order of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.  
 Instruction on preparing a paper for double-blind review  
 Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments. 
  Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back to the authors via web search. 
  Carefully name your files to anonymize author information. 
  Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of "In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that...," sentences in the spirit of "In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that..." should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as "[1] A. Clark ...., "Analysis of...", and it is not acceptable to say "[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review." 
  The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review. 
  Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double-blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The IFIP TC6 will sponsor one Best Paper Award (€ 500) which will be conferred to the authors based on the quality of the paper and its presentation. The award is given out at the closing ceremony of the conference.  
 IFIP Student Travel Grants  
 The International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) will provide support for graduate students to attend the IFIP NETWORKING 2024 conference. Two grants will be awarded, each one up to a maximum of € 750.  
 NSF Student Travel Grants  
 The National Science Foundation (NSF) will provide support for US-based graduate students to attend the IFIP NETWORKING 2024 conference. Three grants will be awarded, each one up to a maximum of $2500.

 Overview  
 NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges.  
 NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.  
  Topics  
 NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:  
 Highly available and reliable networked systems 
  Security and privacy of networked systems 
  Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems 
  Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems 
  Cloud/multi-tenant systems 
  Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems 
  Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies* 
  Network and workload measurement systems 
  Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems 
  Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems 
  Virtualization and resource management for networked systems 
  Experience with deployed networked systems 
  Networked systems for big data 
  Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems 
  Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems 
  *Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.  
 The preceding list is not exhaustive.  That said, the program committee can reject any papers that they consider to be not in scope and relevant to the NSDI community during the review process. Please contact the PC chairs if you have questions about whether your paper would be in scope.  
 Update of August 27, 2024:  Scope Considerations:  For the fall deadline, authors will have the opportunity to explain why their paper is in scope for NSDI by answering the following question: What important problems or challenges in networked systems does this paper solve/address?  
 Two Deadlines  
 NSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by NSDI, for example, listing them on CVs. For more information, see Additional Information about Multiple Deadlines Process  .  
 One-Shot Revision  
 Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at NSDI. Authors may then submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline. At that point, the paper will be reviewed to judge whether it addresses all the revision requirements requested. This review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as earlier. To enable this, PC members who give one-shot-revision decisions for the fall deadline are obligated to participate as external reviewers in the following year to review those papers' resubmissions, which would be considered for the following year's conference. Papers revised and resubmitted following a one-shot-revision decision can only receive a decision of accept or reject, not revise; this is what makes revisions "one-shot."  
 A revise-and-resubmit decision is not a guaranteed acceptance. While revised papers are generally accepted, they can be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed or if the revised version unveils new significant concerns that were hidden in the original submission.  
 The decision about whether to accept a revised paper will be made as follows. Reviewers will primarily judge whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. They will also judge the resubmission on its independent merits, but should avoid rejecting it for non-fatal concerns that they could have raised during the first round of reviews. The reviewers should also ensure that the revised paper doesn't introduce new assertions without sufficient support. Unlike the shepherding process, the revision instructions may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%.  
 During the revision period, the paper is still considered under review to NSDI and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration (as per the USENIX Submission Policy  , which precludes concurrent submission to other conferences).  
 Authors given a one-shot-revision decision will be sent, within a few days of the decision, detailed instructions about how to resubmit. These instructions will include the list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted. They will also explain how the authors should accompany their resubmission with auxiliary material to demonstrate how they've satisfied that list of changes. This auxiliary material will consist of (1) an additional version of the resubmission in which revision changes since the first submission are clearly marked, and (2) a separate textual explanation of the high-level differences between the two versions.  
 If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision for a paper submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '25, this gives them the option to make the requested changes and resubmit it to the next NSDI deadline, which is the first deadline of NSDI '26. If the paper is accepted then, it will appear at NSDI '26, not NSDI '25.  
 Policy on NSDI Resubmissions  
 As described above, each NSDI conference consists of two deadlines: spring and fall. Papers rejected from one of these deadlines cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline. For example, a paper rejected from the fall deadline of NSDI '24 may not be submitted to the spring deadline of NSDI '25 (but can be submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '25); and a paper rejected from the spring deadline of NSDI '25 may not be submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '25.  
 If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision and choose to submit the paper to NSDI '25 they will be required to submit the old paper number from the one-shot-revision decision (e.g., one-shot-revisions from NSDI '24 fall being submitted to NSDI '25 spring will need to provide the NSDI '24 HotCRP paper ID). Papers with numbers that do not agree with previous HotCRP history will be automatically desk rejected. If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision but choose not to submit a revised version, the paper is treated as a reject and the same resubmission policy applies.  
 Extensions of Workshop Papers  
 Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper. The online submission form will also require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper.  
 Resubmission of SIGCOMM '24 and HotNets '25 Papers  
 Authors are free to submit SIGCOMM '24 rejected papers to NSDI '25 spring and significant extensions of HotNets '25 accepted papers to NSDI '25 fall, provided that the notifications from these conferences occur before  the full paper submission deadlines  for NSDI.  
 Operational Systems Track  
 NSDI '25 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. We encourage the submission of papers that disprove or strengthen existing assumptions, deepen the understanding of existing problems, and validate known techniques at scales or environments in which they were never used or tested before. Such operational papers need not present new ideas or results to be accepted; indeed, new ideas or results will not influence whether the papers are accepted. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for operational systems track papers. Since the evaluation of operational systems track papers requires understanding the real-world use of the system, papers in this track will be reviewed in a more limited double-blind process. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, in contrast to other papers, authors need not anonymize the content of their submission in any other way—they may keep company names, links, real system names, etc., as appropriate for the paper.  
 Please note that you cannot switch tracks for your paper after submission since the submission rules differ.  
 Authors should indicate on the title page of the paper and in the submission form that they are submitting to this track.  
 The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted from the operational track to distinguish them from papers accepted from the regular track.  
 What to Submit  
 NSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Note that the operational track papers have different rules as described above. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Please take the following steps when preparing your submission:  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Do not provide links to your own online content. If this online content is critical to the content of your paper, please see the submission form, which allows for some forms of content upload, or contact the PC chairs. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. If you cite anonymous work, you will need to enter the de-anonymized reference(s) on the online submission form. 
  If you need to reference another submission at NSDI '25 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [24]." with the corresponding citation: "[24] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing." 
  Blinding is not intended to be a great burden. If blinding your paper seems too burdensome, please contact the program co-chairs and discuss your specific situation. 
  Submissions—as well as final papers—must be no longer than 12 pages, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper.  
 Submissions must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, in a text block 7" wide x 9" deep, with .33" inter-column space  , formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper.  
 Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible when printed without requiring magnification. Authors may use color in their figures, but the figures should be readable when printed in black and white. If you wish, you may use the template for LaTeX available on the conference paper templates page  . All papers must be submitted via the submission form  . Please do not email submissions.  
 On the Use of Generative AI  
 While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the NSDI Chairs via this form  .  
 Policies  
 Simultaneous submissions:  Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy  for details.  
 Extensions on workshop papers:  Previous publication at a workshop is acceptable as long as the NSDI submission includes substantial new material that has been developed since the publication of any earlier version. However, NSDI submissions cannot be concurrent with submission to a workshop venue. If the notification date for the workshop submission is after the submission date for NSDI, this would be considered a concurrent submission and would be rejected without review. Such concurrent submissions would have limited the possibility of substantially extending the prior work, which would violate the intent of policies allowing for extended submissions (as described in http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/  ). See remarks above about how to cite and contrast with a workshop paper.  
 Update of August 27, 2024:  Online technical reports:  As added clarification for authors submitting to the fall deadline: NSDI allows submissions to be simultaneously stored online as technical reports, e.g., at arXiv, provided that the authors change the title and system name for the period of review. This is to prevent reviewers from being biased (in either direction) when judging the submission.  
 Authors uncertain whether their submission meets USENIX's guidelines should contact the Program Co-Chairs, nsdi25chairs@usenix.org  .  
 Nondisclosure agreement:  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX NSDI '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 Conflicts  
 At submission time, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if any of the following three circumstances applies:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the review period.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, program co-chairship, or editorship within the past two years (since April 2022).  
 You must not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies, even if for some other reason you want to avoid them reviewing your paper. The chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding or removing conflicts if necessary. The chairs may reject abstracts or papers on the basis of egregious missing or extraneous conflicts. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs.  
 Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to, privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient—in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 Processes for Accepted Papers  
 If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.  
 Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the Program Committee. Based on initial feedback from the Program Committee, authors of shepherded papers will submit an editorial revision of their paper to their Program Committee shepherd.

25. Conference NSPW_0:
Skip to main content    New Security Paradigms Workshop    

  Introduction   

 NSPW 2024   will be held on September 16-19, 2024 in Bedford, PA USA. Submissions were due April 28, 2024.  
 The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) is an annual, small invitation-only workshop for researchers in information security and related disciplines. NSPW's focus is on work that challenges the dominant approaches and perspectives in computer security. In the past, such challenges have taken the form of critiques of existing practice as well as novel, sometimes controversial, and often immature approaches to defending computer systems. By providing a forum for important security research that isn't suitable for mainstream security venues, NSPW aims to foster paradigm shifts  in information security.  
 In order to preserve the small, focused nature of the workshop, participation is limited to authors of accepted papers and conference organizers. As a computer security venue, NSPW is unique in format and highly interactive in nature. Each paper is typically the focus of 45 to 60 minutes of presentation and discussion. Authors are encouraged to present ideas that might be considered risky in some other forum, and all participants are charged with providing feedback in a constructive manner. The resulting intensive brainstorming has proven to be an excellent medium for furthering the development of these ideas. The final proceedings are published after the workshop, giving authors an opportunity to incorporate feedback from the workshop.  
 NSPW is an ACSA  conference. The proceedings of NSPW are published by the ACM  . Full proceedings are available  .

  Call for papers data:  New Security Paradigms Workshop    

  Call for papers   

 In addition to regular submissions presenting new security paradigms, NSPW also has an optional theme each year to encourage submissions in specific areas of interest or importance. The theme for NSPW 2024 is Response.   
 Cyber security is a rapidly moving field driven by changes in technical, socio-technical and geopolitical drivers. The security community is constantly responding to these changes as well as to short-term events. The response theme is appropriate for submissions looking at, for example, new paradigms for response functions, responding to changes in the threat and technology landscape, how humans respond to one another in the context of cyber security and new paradigms to optimize or improve response strategies.  
 Relevant topics for this theme include:  
 Novel paradigms for detection and response activities 
  Response planning and awareness 
  Responses to changing threat landscapes and technologies 
  Response methodologies and evaluation criteria 
  Predictive approaches to develop cyber security response activity 
  Response design, automated, human, or combined 
  Interactions between human and automated response 
  The consequences of not responding 
  Other related topics and interpretations of response are welcome.  
 NSPW 2024 is scheduled to be held in the Omni Bedford Springs, Bedford, PA, United States. As in the past, this choice of venue is designed to facilitate interactions between the invited attendees throughout the workshop.  
 Submission Instructions  
 NSPW accepts three categories of submissions:  
 Regular Submissions present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results (mathematical or experimental), unlike papers submitted to most computer security venues, these results should not be the focus of the submission; instead, the change in approach should be the focus. 
  Theme Submissions are focused on “Response”, and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement (see below). They follow the format of a regular submission. 
  Implementation Submissions explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. Historic NSPW submissions have often proposed new paradigms but do not extend to implementation. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope. Original authors may be involved or not; if not, they will be offered the chance to comment on the submission. 
  Submissions must be made in PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM "sigconf" formatting, through EasyChair. Submissions should blind author identity where possible. The LaTeX document option anonymous=true provides a minimum level of protection; however, authors should also avoid referencing their own work in the first person or other obvious de-anonymization in the submission.  
 EasyChair submission: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2024   
 NSPW Submissions must include both a cover page with authors' names, affiliation, and participation statement and a justification statement before or after the abstract.  
 To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission, but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. 
  The participation statement (on the cover page) must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct. 
  The justification statement (included in the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. 
  Papers not including both statements risk rejection without review.  
 Organizers and PC members are allowed to submit, but will not be involved in the evaluation of their own papers. All submissions are treated as confidential as a matter of policy. NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.  
 Given the focus on the development and exploration of new ideas, the process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.  
 The submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct, https://www.nspw.org/conduct  .  
 Attendance  
 The workshop itself is invitation-only, with typically 30-35 participants consisting of authors of about 10-12 accepted papers, panelists, program committee members, and organizers. One author of each accepted paper must attend; additional authors may be invited if space permits. All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5 day program, sharing meals in a group setting, and complying with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.  
 NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. Any potential attendee who would like to take advantage of this or has questions, please email general-chairs@nspw.org  now. We would like to get a general understanding of interest and capacity to assist with planning for the event.

 Overview  
 NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges.  
 NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.  
  Topics  
 NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:  
 Highly available and reliable networked systems 
  Security and privacy of networked systems 
  Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems 
  Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems 
  Cloud/multi-tenant systems 
  Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems 
  Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies* 
  Network and workload measurement systems 
  Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems 
  Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems 
  Virtualization and resource management for networked systems 
  Experience with deployed networked systems 
  Networked systems for big data 
  Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems 
  Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems 
  *Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.  
 The preceding list is not exhaustive.  That said, the program committee can reject any papers that they consider to be not in scope and relevant to the NSDI community during the review process. Please contact the PC chairs if you have questions about whether your paper would be in scope.  
 Update of August 27, 2024:  Scope Considerations:  For the fall deadline, authors will have the opportunity to explain why their paper is in scope for NSDI by answering the following question: What important problems or challenges in networked systems does this paper solve/address?  
 Two Deadlines  
 NSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by NSDI, for example, listing them on CVs. For more information, see Additional Information about Multiple Deadlines Process  .  
 One-Shot Revision  
 Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at NSDI. Authors may then submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline. At that point, the paper will be reviewed to judge whether it addresses all the revision requirements requested. This review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as earlier. To enable this, PC members who give one-shot-revision decisions for the fall deadline are obligated to participate as external reviewers in the following year to review those papers' resubmissions, which would be considered for the following year's conference. Papers revised and resubmitted following a one-shot-revision decision can only receive a decision of accept or reject, not revise; this is what makes revisions "one-shot."  
 A revise-and-resubmit decision is not a guaranteed acceptance. While revised papers are generally accepted, they can be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed or if the revised version unveils new significant concerns that were hidden in the original submission.  
 The decision about whether to accept a revised paper will be made as follows. Reviewers will primarily judge whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. They will also judge the resubmission on its independent merits, but should avoid rejecting it for non-fatal concerns that they could have raised during the first round of reviews. The reviewers should also ensure that the revised paper doesn't introduce new assertions without sufficient support. Unlike the shepherding process, the revision instructions may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%.  
 During the revision period, the paper is still considered under review to NSDI and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration (as per the USENIX Submission Policy  , which precludes concurrent submission to other conferences).  
 Authors given a one-shot-revision decision will be sent, within a few days of the decision, detailed instructions about how to resubmit. These instructions will include the list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted. They will also explain how the authors should accompany their resubmission with auxiliary material to demonstrate how they've satisfied that list of changes. This auxiliary material will consist of (1) an additional version of the resubmission in which revision changes since the first submission are clearly marked, and (2) a separate textual explanation of the high-level differences between the two versions.  
 If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision for a paper submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '25, this gives them the option to make the requested changes and resubmit it to the next NSDI deadline, which is the first deadline of NSDI '26. If the paper is accepted then, it will appear at NSDI '26, not NSDI '25.  
 Policy on NSDI Resubmissions  
 As described above, each NSDI conference consists of two deadlines: spring and fall. Papers rejected from one of these deadlines cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline. For example, a paper rejected from the fall deadline of NSDI '24 may not be submitted to the spring deadline of NSDI '25 (but can be submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '25); and a paper rejected from the spring deadline of NSDI '25 may not be submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '25.  
 If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision and choose to submit the paper to NSDI '25 they will be required to submit the old paper number from the one-shot-revision decision (e.g., one-shot-revisions from NSDI '24 fall being submitted to NSDI '25 spring will need to provide the NSDI '24 HotCRP paper ID). Papers with numbers that do not agree with previous HotCRP history will be automatically desk rejected. If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision but choose not to submit a revised version, the paper is treated as a reject and the same resubmission policy applies.  
 Extensions of Workshop Papers  
 Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper. The online submission form will also require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper.  
 Resubmission of SIGCOMM '24 and HotNets '25 Papers  
 Authors are free to submit SIGCOMM '24 rejected papers to NSDI '25 spring and significant extensions of HotNets '25 accepted papers to NSDI '25 fall, provided that the notifications from these conferences occur before  the full paper submission deadlines  for NSDI.  
 Operational Systems Track  
 NSDI '25 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. We encourage the submission of papers that disprove or strengthen existing assumptions, deepen the understanding of existing problems, and validate known techniques at scales or environments in which they were never used or tested before. Such operational papers need not present new ideas or results to be accepted; indeed, new ideas or results will not influence whether the papers are accepted. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for operational systems track papers. Since the evaluation of operational systems track papers requires understanding the real-world use of the system, papers in this track will be reviewed in a more limited double-blind process. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, in contrast to other papers, authors need not anonymize the content of their submission in any other way—they may keep company names, links, real system names, etc., as appropriate for the paper.  
 Please note that you cannot switch tracks for your paper after submission since the submission rules differ.  
 Authors should indicate on the title page of the paper and in the submission form that they are submitting to this track.  
 The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted from the operational track to distinguish them from papers accepted from the regular track.  
 What to Submit  
 NSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Note that the operational track papers have different rules as described above. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Please take the following steps when preparing your submission:  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Do not provide links to your own online content. If this online content is critical to the content of your paper, please see the submission form, which allows for some forms of content upload, or contact the PC chairs. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. If you cite anonymous work, you will need to enter the de-anonymized reference(s) on the online submission form. 
  If you need to reference another submission at NSDI '25 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [24]." with the corresponding citation: "[24] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing." 
  Blinding is not intended to be a great burden. If blinding your paper seems too burdensome, please contact the program co-chairs and discuss your specific situation. 
  Submissions—as well as final papers—must be no longer than 12 pages, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper.  
 Submissions must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, in a text block 7" wide x 9" deep, with .33" inter-column space  , formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper.  
 Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible when printed without requiring magnification. Authors may use color in their figures, but the figures should be readable when printed in black and white. If you wish, you may use the template for LaTeX available on the conference paper templates page  . All papers must be submitted via the submission form  . Please do not email submissions.  
 On the Use of Generative AI  
 While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the NSDI Chairs via this form  .  
 Policies  
 Simultaneous submissions:  Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy  for details.  
 Extensions on workshop papers:  Previous publication at a workshop is acceptable as long as the NSDI submission includes substantial new material that has been developed since the publication of any earlier version. However, NSDI submissions cannot be concurrent with submission to a workshop venue. If the notification date for the workshop submission is after the submission date for NSDI, this would be considered a concurrent submission and would be rejected without review. Such concurrent submissions would have limited the possibility of substantially extending the prior work, which would violate the intent of policies allowing for extended submissions (as described in http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/  ). See remarks above about how to cite and contrast with a workshop paper.  
 Update of August 27, 2024:  Online technical reports:  As added clarification for authors submitting to the fall deadline: NSDI allows submissions to be simultaneously stored online as technical reports, e.g., at arXiv, provided that the authors change the title and system name for the period of review. This is to prevent reviewers from being biased (in either direction) when judging the submission.  
 Authors uncertain whether their submission meets USENIX's guidelines should contact the Program Co-Chairs, nsdi25chairs@usenix.org  .  
 Nondisclosure agreement:  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX NSDI '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 Conflicts  
 At submission time, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if any of the following three circumstances applies:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the review period.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, program co-chairship, or editorship within the past two years (since April 2022).  
 You must not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies, even if for some other reason you want to avoid them reviewing your paper. The chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding or removing conflicts if necessary. The chairs may reject abstracts or papers on the basis of egregious missing or extraneous conflicts. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs.  
 Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to, privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient—in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 Processes for Accepted Papers  
 If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.  
 Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the Program Committee. Based on initial feedback from the Program Committee, authors of shepherded papers will submit an editorial revision of their paper to their Program Committee shepherd. The shepherd will review the paper and give the author additional comments. Authors will upload their final file to the submissions system by the final paper deadline for the conference proceedings.  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .

28. Conference NSPW_1:
Skip to main content    New Security Paradigms Workshop    

  Call for papers   

 In addition to regular submissions presenting new security paradigms, NSPW also has an optional theme each year to encourage submissions in specific areas of interest or importance. The theme for NSPW 2024 is Response.   
 Cyber security is a rapidly moving field driven by changes in technical, socio-technical and geopolitical drivers. The security community is constantly responding to these changes as well as to short-term events. The response theme is appropriate for submissions looking at, for example, new paradigms for response functions, responding to changes in the threat and technology landscape, how humans respond to one another in the context of cyber security and new paradigms to optimize or improve response strategies.  
 Relevant topics for this theme include:  
 Novel paradigms for detection and response activities 
  Response planning and awareness 
  Responses to changing threat landscapes and technologies 
  Response methodologies and evaluation criteria 
  Predictive approaches to develop cyber security response activity 
  Response design, automated, human, or combined 
  Interactions between human and automated response 
  The consequences of not responding 
  Other related topics and interpretations of response are welcome.  
 NSPW 2024 is scheduled to be held in the Omni Bedford Springs, Bedford, PA, United States. As in the past, this choice of venue is designed to facilitate interactions between the invited attendees throughout the workshop.  
 Submission Instructions  
 NSPW accepts three categories of submissions:  
 Regular Submissions present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results (mathematical or experimental), unlike papers submitted to most computer security venues, these results should not be the focus of the submission; instead, the change in approach should be the focus. 
  Theme Submissions are focused on “Response”, and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement (see below). They follow the format of a regular submission. 
  Implementation Submissions explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. Historic NSPW submissions have often proposed new paradigms but do not extend to implementation. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope. Original authors may be involved or not; if not, they will be offered the chance to comment on the submission. 
  Submissions must be made in PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM "sigconf" formatting, through EasyChair. Submissions should blind author identity where possible. The LaTeX document option anonymous=true provides a minimum level of protection; however, authors should also avoid referencing their own work in the first person or other obvious de-anonymization in the submission.  
 EasyChair submission: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2024   
 NSPW Submissions must include both a cover page with authors' names, affiliation, and participation statement and a justification statement before or after the abstract.  
 To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission, but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. 
  The participation statement (on the cover page) must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct. 
  The justification statement (included in the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. 
  Papers not including both statements risk rejection without review.  
 Organizers and PC members are allowed to submit, but will not be involved in the evaluation of their own papers. All submissions are treated as confidential as a matter of policy. NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.  
 Given the focus on the development and exploration of new ideas, the process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.  
 The submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct, https://www.nspw.org/conduct  .  
 Attendance  
 The workshop itself is invitation-only, with typically 30-35 participants consisting of authors of about 10-12 accepted papers, panelists, program committee members, and organizers. One author of each accepted paper must attend; additional authors may be invited if space permits. All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5 day program, sharing meals in a group setting, and complying with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.  
 NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. Any potential attendee who would like to take advantage of this or has questions, please email general-chairs@nspw.org  now. We would like to get a general understanding of interest and capacity to assist with planning for the event.

 About NSS 2023  
 While the attack systems have become more easy-to-use, sophisticated, and powerful, interest has greatly increased in the field of building more effective, intelligent, adaptive, active and high performance defense systems which are distributed and networked. The conference will cover research on all theoretical and practical aspects related to network and system security, such as authentication, access control, availability, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, dependability and sustainability of computer networks and systems.  
 Founded in 2007, the aim of the NSS (International Conference on Network and System Security) series  is to provide a leading edge forum to foster interaction between researchers and developers with the network and system security communities, and to give attendees an opportunity to interact with experts in academia, industry, and governments. NSS 2023 is the 17th edition of the International Conference on Network and System Security series, which started in 2007. Previous editions were held in: Fiji (2022)  ; Tianjin, China (2021)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2020)  ; Sapporo, Japan (2019)  ; Hong Kong, China (2018)  ; Helsinki, Finland (2017)  ; Taipei (2016)  ; New York City, USA (2015)  ; Xi'an, China (2014)  ; Madrid, Spain (2013)  ; Wu Yi Shan, China (2012)  ; Milan, Italy (2011)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2010)  ; Gold Coast, Australia (2009)  ; Shanghai, China (2008)  ; and Dalian, China (2007).  
 About SocialSec 2023  
 Social Networks and Big Data have pervaded all aspects of our daily lives. With their unparalleled popularity, social networks have evolved from the platforms for social communication and news dissemination, to indispensable tools for professional networking, social recommendations, marketing, and online content distribution. Social Networks, together with other activities, produce Big Data that is beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools to capture, manage, and process within a tolerable elapsed time. It has been widely recognised that security and privacy are the critical challenges for Social Networks and Big Data applications due to their scale, complexity and heterogeneity.  
 SocialSec 2023 is the 9th edition of the International Symposium on Security and Privacy in Social Networks and Big Data series  , which started in 2015. Previous editions were held in Xi'an, China (2022)  ; Fuzhou, China (2021)  ; Tianjin, China (2020)  ; Copenhagen, Denmark (2019)  ; Santa Clara, CA, USA (2018)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2017)  ; Fiji (2016)  ; and Hangzhou, China (2015)  .

  Call for papers data:  New Security Paradigms Workshop    

  Call for papers   

 In addition to regular submissions presenting new security paradigms, NSPW also has an optional theme each year to encourage submissions in specific areas of interest or importance. The theme for NSPW 2024 is Response.   
 Cyber security is a rapidly moving field driven by changes in technical, socio-technical and geopolitical drivers. The security community is constantly responding to these changes as well as to short-term events. The response theme is appropriate for submissions looking at, for example, new paradigms for response functions, responding to changes in the threat and technology landscape, how humans respond to one another in the context of cyber security and new paradigms to optimize or improve response strategies.  
 Relevant topics for this theme include:  
 Novel paradigms for detection and response activities 
  Response planning and awareness 
  Responses to changing threat landscapes and technologies 
  Response methodologies and evaluation criteria 
  Predictive approaches to develop cyber security response activity 
  Response design, automated, human, or combined 
  Interactions between human and automated response 
  The consequences of not responding 
  Other related topics and interpretations of response are welcome.  
 NSPW 2024 is scheduled to be held in the Omni Bedford Springs, Bedford, PA, United States. As in the past, this choice of venue is designed to facilitate interactions between the invited attendees throughout the workshop.  
 Submission Instructions  
 NSPW accepts three categories of submissions:  
 Regular Submissions present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results (mathematical or experimental), unlike papers submitted to most computer security venues, these results should not be the focus of the submission; instead, the change in approach should be the focus. 
  Theme Submissions are focused on “Response”, and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement (see below). They follow the format of a regular submission. 
  Implementation Submissions explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. Historic NSPW submissions have often proposed new paradigms but do not extend to implementation. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope. Original authors may be involved or not; if not, they will be offered the chance to comment on the submission. 
  Submissions must be made in PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM "sigconf" formatting, through EasyChair. Submissions should blind author identity where possible. The LaTeX document option anonymous=true provides a minimum level of protection; however, authors should also avoid referencing their own work in the first person or other obvious de-anonymization in the submission.  
 EasyChair submission: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2024   
 NSPW Submissions must include both a cover page with authors' names, affiliation, and participation statement and a justification statement before or after the abstract.  
 To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission, but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. 
  The participation statement (on the cover page) must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct. 
  The justification statement (included in the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. 
  Papers not including both statements risk rejection without review.  
 Organizers and PC members are allowed to submit, but will not be involved in the evaluation of their own papers. All submissions are treated as confidential as a matter of policy. NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.  
 Given the focus on the development and exploration of new ideas, the process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.  
 The submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct, https://www.nspw.org/conduct  .  
 Attendance  
 The workshop itself is invitation-only, with typically 30-35 participants consisting of authors of about 10-12 accepted papers, panelists, program committee members, and organizers. One author of each accepted paper must attend; additional authors may be invited if space permits. All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5 day program, sharing meals in a group setting, and complying with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.  
 NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. Any potential attendee who would like to take advantage of this or has questions, please email general-chairs@nspw.org  now. We would like to get a general understanding of interest and capacity to assist with planning for the event.

  NSPW Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Speakers   

 The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) is committed to providing a safe and enjoyable event experience for all event participants, and a welcoming environment for free discussion of ideas. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. We wish to publicly thank the ACSA organization for allowing us to adapt their Code of Conduct (which is in turn based on the USENIX Code of Conduct) for our use.  
 What constitutes harassment?  
 Harassment includes—but is not limited to—unwelcome conduct or offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwelcome or unauthorized photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Similarly, encouraging others to engage in such behavior is not permitted, nor are false accusations of harassment.  
 Who is covered under this Code of Conduct?  
 All attendees, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, staff, and volunteers at our events are required to refrain from harassment. NSPW organizers will enforce this Code throughout the event, and expects cooperation from all participants.  
 NSPW also requests that event participants refrain from using potentially offensive language in social media posts using our event hashtags.  
 Guidelines for Speakers  
 Speakers are responsible for the content of their presentations, but NSPW requests that speakers be cognizant of potentially offensive actions, language, or imagery, and that they consider whether it is necessary to convey their message. If they do decide to include it, NSPW asks that they warn the audience, at the beginning of the talk, and provide them with the opportunity to leave the room to avoid seeing or hearing the material.  
 How should I handle an uncomfortable situation at an event?  
 Interpersonal Behavior:  If it is safe to do so, we encourage you to request that the person stop the unwelcome or harassing behavior. Participants who are asked to stop any such behavior are expected to comply immediately.  
 If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any related concerns, please contact an NSPW organizer or steering committee member immediately. At the start of the workshop as part of the NSPW social contract, the workshop organizers will clearly identify at least two individuals who will be responsible for handling concerns related to this Code of Conduct. You may also email organizers directly; contact information is available at https://www.nspw.org/   
 Talks and Presentations:  NSPW event organizers welcome comments of all kinds about talks and presentations. Attendee comments are taken seriously when planning future events and will be kept in confidence if requested.  
 What happens once a report is made?  
 If an incident of harassment is reported, NSPW organizers will conduct an investigation. If they determine—to the best of their ability, and in their sole discretion—that a participant has violated this Code, they may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender  
  or expulsion from the event with no refund. Under certain circumstances and at their discretion, NSPW may contact hotel security and/or local police. To protect all parties involved, NSPW will generally not make any detailed public statements about Code of Conduct incidents.  
 This is a living document  
 NSPW intends for these policies to meet the needs of our constituents to have a positive event experience, and we welcome comments and suggestions from the community. Please contact NSPW staff onsite or by email if you would like to provide feedback.

  Awards  
 Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (1) for 2011 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Coding at the Speed of Touch 
  Conference: Onward! 2011 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2048237.2048246 
  Citation: This 2011 Onward! paper describes the design and implementation of YinYang, a graphical system providing a proficient programming experience for tablet devices with constrained screen space. YingYang’s tile-based approach sidestepped these devices’ limited text-editing capabilities and enabled an intuitive and effective form of direct manipulation. The work stands out as an emblematic Onward! contribution. It is notable for championing programmability on a class of traditionally “closed” devices, exploring many subtle design points of graphical and visual languages, and as a call to action for moving “beyond typewriters” and inspiring the next generation of programmers. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (2) for 2012 | Recipients: Andrew P. Black, Kim B. Bruce, Michael Homer and James Noble 
  Title: Grace: the Absence of (Inessential) Difficulty 
  Conference: Onward! 2012 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2384592.2384601 
  Citation: In this Onward! 2012 paper, the authors distilled a tremendous effort to accommodate the needs of programming pedagogy in a new language design. The paper is a model of clarity, deftly justifying its choices while also situating Grace within the rich history of programming languages past and present. It has supported and inspired considerable follow-on work, not only on pedagogy but also in programming language research topics such as gradual typing and the semantics of object-orientation. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2023 for 2013 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Usable Live Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2013 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2509578.2509585 
  Citation: This paper revitalized the study of live programming, introducing mechanisms that are now standard techniques in the field. The paper epitomizes the spirit of Onward!, asking risky questions outside the current discourse. In its form the paper was a breath of fresh air, enlivened by the use of comic strips. The work marked the beginning of a rich seam of research that has been productively mined at the ongoing LIVE workshop series at SPLASH. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010 | Recipients: Lennart C. L. Kats, Eelco Visser, and Guido Wachsmuth 
  Title: Pure and Declarative Syntax Definition: Paradise Lost and Regained 
  Conference: Onward! 2010 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869459.1869535 
  Citation: In a beautiful and compelling exposition, this essay lays out a research vision for realizing a declarative approach to syntax definition. Considering how we can best capture the syntactic structure of a programming language is a question near to the heart of both language design and implementation. The essay is technically interesting without getting lost in formality. Its argument for the declarative paradigm has been influential, impacting a chain of research on declarative syntax tools and helping to usher in the recent era of polyglot programming. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009 | Recipient: William R. Cook 
  Title: On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited 
  Conference: Onward! 2009 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1640133 
  Citation: The 2009 Onward! essay “On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited” compares abstract data types and objects as two forms of data abstraction. In particular, the paper describes many points of differences and similarities between them clearly and comprehensively. The paper is not only most notable for summarizing a long history of discussions, but also for letting many programming language designers reflect on this topic again. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008 | Recipient: Richard P. Gabriel 
  Title: Designed as Designer 
  Conference: Onward! 2008 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1449813 
  Citation: The 2008 Onward! essay “Designed as Designer” examines the nature of creativity and design, exploring poetry, architecture and software. In particular, the paper sets out to explore questions about our self-conception as computer scientists and programmers. This paper is notable for paving the way for a new track that became Essays at Onward!. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007 | Recipient: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Living it up with a Live Programming Language 
  Conference: Onward! 2007 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297073 
  Citation: The 2007 Onward! paper “Living it up with a Live Programming Language” brought the idea of Live Programming into focus by examining the necessary mechanisms, developing a good running example, displaying a contrarian attitude, and explaining it all with admirably clear writing. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006 | Recipient: Friedrich Steimann 
  Title: The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2006 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1167514 
  Citation: The 2006 Onward! Essay “The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming” presents a considered and articulated exploration of the nature of aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In particular, the paper takes a hard look at the value proposed for AOP, together with an examination of what is achieved and what sacrifices appear to be necessary. The paper does not attack AOP, but rather takes a sober look at the hopes and the fears. In doing so, the paper provides a careful review that might also form the basis for progress, even if the form of progress might differ from the original promise. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005 | Recipient: Jonathan Edwards 
  Title: Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2005 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094811.1094851 
  Citation: The 2005 Onward! paper “Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming” presented a new kind of programming, unifying programs and their execution, and which helped establish Onward! as a forum for high-end, lateral thinking about programming. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2014 for 2004 | Recipient: Tim Sheard 
  Title: Languages of the Future 
  Conference: Onward! 2004 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052883.1052897 
  Citation: The 2004 Onward! paper “Languages of the Future” pioneered the idea of lightweight dependently-typed programming, and idea that has since found its way into several languages, and continues to progress today. This paper is notable for bringing together complex ideas in a compelling way; pointing to how they could be incorporated into “ordinary” languages; and influencing the practical world of software development with this pearl of a design. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2013 for 2003 | Recipient: Martin Rinard 
  Title: Acceptability-oriented Computing 
  Conference: Onward! 2003 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=949344.949402 
  Citation: The 2003 Onward! paper “Acceptability-Oriented Computing” introduced the approach of defining the boundaries of acceptable program behavior for a software system, and then augmenting the original system by layering components to enforce those boundaries—this instead of attempting to construct a completely error-free system. This paper led to a still-expanding series of papers exploring this approach, its capabilities and its benefits. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2012 for 2002 | Recipients: James Noble and Robert Biddle 
  Title: Notes on Postmodern Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2002 
  Paper: | http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/Onward!Proceedings-2002.pdf 
  Citation: The 2002 Onward! paper “Notes on Postmodern Programming” uses postmodern concepts to understand contemporary programming, especially as software grows in scale and design is dispersed to a diversity of stakeholders. This paper is notable because it triggered a storm of immediate responses and ongoing discussion on the Web; it introduced the essay genre to the programming community and cut the path that led to a new technical track at Onward! (Essays); and it stated for the first time the philosophical model of at-scale software development that dominates today.

 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  Introduction   
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  
 What’s New   
 There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  
 Reserve Reviewer Policy 
  Data-Availability Statement 
  Contact   
 You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  
 oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  
 In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  
 At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  
 Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  
 Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  
 Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  
 If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  
 If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. 
  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. 
  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. 
  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. 
  Reserve Reviewer Policy   
 To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  
 Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  
  
 The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  
 Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  
 We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  
 The paper has no senior authors. 
  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. 
  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); 
  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; 
  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. 
  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  
 Submissions   
 Template   
 SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 Page Limit   
 Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  
 Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  
 Anonymity   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymize supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Novelty   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  
 In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  
 It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  
 Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  
 Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  
 Procedure   
 Please submit using HotCRP  .  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  
 The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  You can find the updated policy here  .  
 FAQ   
 What are reviewers looking for?   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  
 How are papers from previous years handled?   
 We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  
 Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  
 Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  
 What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  
 Should I change the name of my system?   
 No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  
 My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  
 Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   
 We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  
 Things you may  do:  
 Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not  do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

 Welcome to the website of the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference!  
 For the first time, the two leading SIGPLAN venues—ICFP and SPLASH—will be co-located in Singapore in 2025:  
 ICFP 2025  : The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is an annual programming language conference that provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries. 
  SPLASH 2025  : The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery, to make it the premier conference on the applications of programming languages - at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. 
  We couldn’t be more excited to host academics and practitioners from all around the globe in one of the most vibrant and safe cities in the world!

 Overview NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges. NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services. Topics NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list: Highly available and reliable networked systems Security and privacy of networked systems Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems Cloud/multi-tenant systems Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies* Network and workload measurement systems Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems Virtualization and resource management for networked systems Experience with deployed networked systems Networked systems for big data Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems *Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope. The following list is not exhaustive. That said, the program committee can reject any papers that they consider to be not in scope and relevant to the NSDI community during the review process. Please contact the PC chairs if you have questions about whether your paper would be in scope.  最后更新 Dou Sun  在 2024-04-20

 Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)  
  OOPSLA (Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications) is now part of SPLASH (Systems, Programming Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity).  
 The SPLASH Steering Committee  serves as the OOPSLA Steering Committee.  
 The scope of OOPSLA includes all aspects of programming languages and software engineering, broadly construed. Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages, program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs, corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).  
 Most Influential OOPSLA Paper Award  Each year a “Most Influential” OOPSLA paper is chosen and an presentation is made at OOPSLA. More details about this award and past winning papers can be found here  . SIGPLAN also makes several other awards including an “Outstanding Dissertation Award.” Please consider making a nomination for one of these awards. More details about the SIGPLAN awards can be found here  .

  Introduction   
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  
 What’s New   
 There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  
 Reserve Reviewer Policy 
  Data-Availability Statement 
  Contact   
 You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  
 oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  
 In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  
 At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  
 Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  
 Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  
 Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  
 If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  
 If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. 
  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. 
  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. 
  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. 
  Reserve Reviewer Policy   
 To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  
 Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  
  
 The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  
 Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  
 We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  
 The paper has no senior authors. 
  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. 
  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); 
  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; 
  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. 
  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  
 Submissions   
 Template   
 SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 Page Limit   
 Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  
 Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  
 Anonymity   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymize supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Novelty   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  
 In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  
 It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  
 Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  
 Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  
 Procedure   
 Please submit using HotCRP  .  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  
 The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  You can find the updated policy here  .  
 FAQ   
 What are reviewers looking for?   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  
 How are papers from previous years handled?   
 We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  
 Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  
 Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  
 What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  
 Should I change the name of my system?   
 No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  
 My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  
 Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   
 We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  
 Things you may  do:  
 Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not  do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2023papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2023papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modelling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2024 will have two separate rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline on the 20th of October 2023  (note that SPLASH/OOPSLA 2023  is 22-27 October 2023) and the Round 2 submission deadline on the 5th of April 2024 (Anywhere on Earth)   .  
 In each round, papers will have a final outcome of Accept, Revise, or Reject—see Review Process for details. Papers accepted at either of the rounds will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2024.  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing with submission deadlines around October and April each year. As you submit your paper you will receive around three reviews and an opportunity to provide an author response that will be read and addressed by the reviewers in the final decision outcome summary. There are 5 possible outcomes at the end of the round:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Conditional Accept  : You will receive a list of required revisions that you will need to address. You must submit a revised paper, a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. Assuming you meet the listed requirements, after further review by the same reviewers, your paper will very likely be accepted. This process has to be completed within two months of the initial decision  for the paper to be accepted, so we encourage timely turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a conditional accept review it should remain anonymous until fully accepted.  
 Minor Revision  : The reviewers have concerns that go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Therefore, while you may receive a list of revisions suggested by the reviewers, this will not necessarily be comprehensive. You will have the opportunity to resubmit your revised paper and have it re-reviewed by the same reviewers, which may or may not result in your paper’s acceptance. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. This process has to be completed within two months of the initial decision  for the paper to be accepted in the current round, so we encourage timely turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a minor revision review it should remain anonymous until fully accepted.  
 IMPORTANT NOTE FROM AEC:  A minor revision is also invited to submit the artefact in case the paper is accepted for this year’s publication. Note that AEC and OOPSLA RC are different sets of people, so the paper will remain blinded to the OOPSLA RC reviewers.  
 Major Revision  : You will receive a list of revisions suggested by the reviewers. Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the next round of submissions  with a specific set of expectations to be met. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. The revised paper will be re-evaluated in the next round. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process to the extent possible. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a major revision review in the next round it should remain anonymous.  
 IMPORTANT NOTE FROM SIGPLAN:  A major revision decision also says that the paper is considered under submission to OOPSLA and cannot be resubmitted elsewhere unless the paper is explicitly withdrawn from consideration for OOPSLA.  
 Reject  : Rejected papers will not be included in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of the original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The Chairs will decide whether or not a paper is a resubmission of the same work.  
 Submissions   
 Submitted papers (including resubmissions) must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. The references do not count towards this limit. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead, authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. The PACMPL templates used for SPLASH (Microsoft Word and LaTeX) and the instructions for their use can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 As of late 2023, the ACM LaTeX Template was located here  with the relevant file in the samples folder and called sample-acmsmall.tex .  
 Papers may use either numeric or author-year citations. In LaTeX, use \citestyle{acmauthoryear} to select author-year citations; nothing needs to be done to use numeric citations, which are the default.  
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymise supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Artifacts   
 Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. Please note that the artifact submission deadline will be following closely the paper notification deadline so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper to PACMPL(OOPSLA).   
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers find data and software, OOPSLA recommends adding a section just before the references titled Data-Availability Statement  . If the paper has an artifact, cite it here. If there is no artifact, this section can explain how to obtain relevant code. The statement does not count  toward the OOPSLA 2023 page limit. It may be included in the submitted paper, in fact we encourage this, even if the DOI is not ready yet.  
 Example:   
 \section{Conclusion} .... \section*{Data-Availability Statement} The software that supports~\cref{s:design,s:evaluation} is available on Software Heritage~\cite{artifact-swh} and Zenodo~\cite{artifact-doi}. \begin{acks} ....  Expert PC Members   
 During the submission, we will ask you to list up to 3 non-conflicted PC members who you think are experts on the topic of this submission, starting with the most expert. This list will not be used as an input during the paper assignment and it will not be visible to the PC. It may be used by the PC Chair and Associate Chairs for advice on external experts if the paper lacks expert reviews.  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400 USD), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than the 1st of April 2024, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than the 1st of October 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  You can find the updated policy here:  
 https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship   
 Camera Ready Requirements   
 The page limit for the camera-ready version is 27 pages plus references  (note the 4-page increase compared to the reviewed version to accommodate any further changes requested by the reviewers), there are no page charges for this extension to 27 pages excluding references.  
 We prefer if the authors stay within the original reviewed 23 page limit as that was fully reviewed and go over the limit only if requested by the reviewers. We allow this increase to be applied to accepted papers, as well as conditionally accepted and minor revision papers as part of the resubmission. This increase does not normally apply to the major revisions.   
 FAQ   
 Selection Criteria   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.  
 Papers Resubmitted from previous year OOPSLA R2 to this year OOPSLA R1   
 Q: What process is followed for “major revisions” papers between different years? We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) getting another “major revision” is not an option given to the reviewers.  
 Artifacts   
 Q: Are artifacts required? No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. But if an artifact is not provided when the claims in the paper refer to an artifact, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  
 Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected? Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  
 Double-Blinding Submissions (Authors)   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper? Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity.  
 Q: Should I change the name of my system? No.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this? Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work? No. But we recommend you do not use the same title so that it clearly distinguishes the papers.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media? We have developed guidelines to help navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs.  
 Things you may do  :  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Review Committee Chairs. 

 Speakers and Session Chairs  
   
 Session Chair Instructions   
 Please assemble in the room at least 15 minutes before the session starts, ensure that at least one presenter is present for each paper, and have at least one question ready for each paper in case there are none from the audience. We advise you to look at or read the papers in your session! Please get in touch with the RC chairs via email or other means if any of the presenters are missing 10 minutes before the start of the session.  
 Presenter/Speaker Instructions   
 Please be at the designated room 15 minutes before your entire session starts to check your AV equipment setup and introduce yourself to the session chair. Your slot is 20 minutes long, which means we expect your talk to last only 15 minutes and leave 5 minutes for Q&A chaired by the session chair. Please remember to fill out this form  if you are presenting!

 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 Title:  Sentiment Analysis of Open Source Software Community Mailing List: A Preliminary Analysis

 Abstract:  Open source software has become increasingly popular with companies looking to create business value through collaboration with distributed communities of organizations and software developers who rely on mailing lists to review code and share their feedback.

 Sentiment Analysis of Open Source Communities: An Exploratory Study   
 March 4, 2020    Conference Contributions  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions  , Short Research Papers   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Sentiment Analysis of Open Source Communities: An Exploratory Study  
 Authors:  Jennifer Ferreira (National University of Ireland, Galway), Michael Glynn (Intel Shannon), David Hunt (Intel Shannon), Jaganath Babu (National University of Ireland, Galway), Denis Dennehy (National University of Ireland, Galway), Kieran Conboy (National University of Ireland, Galway)  
 Abstract:  Open Source Software (OSS) mailing lists have become popular targets for mining sentiment and emotions, as they provide a centralized communication hub between the distributed OSS community. Sentiment and emotions within communities can provide insights into how a community responds to certain events, who are the key members and how their behaviours impact the rest of the community. Such insights can inform initiatives aimed at fostering positive interactions between OSS community members, strengthening social ties, and helping the community accomplish its tasks. This poster presents our initial results from sentiment analysis of an OSS mailing list, and answers two key questions: (1) Given that the mailing list is used for peer-review of code, is the community sentiment negative overall? (2) Is community sentiment related to the month of the release cycle?

We propose Open Data Collaboration (ODC) to describe pecuniary and non-pecuniary sharing of open data, similar to Open Source Software. To understand challenges and opportunities with ODC, we ran focus groups with 22 companies and organizations. We observed an interest in the subject, but we conclude that the overall maturity is low and ODC is rare.

 Title:  What We Talk About When We Talk About Wikidata Quality: A Literature Survey  
 Authors:  Alessandro Piscopo (University of Southampton), Elena Simperl (University of Southampton)  
 Abstract:  Launched in 2012, Wikidata has already become a success story. It is a collaborative knowledge graph, whose large community has produced so far data about more than 55 million entities. Understanding the quality of the data in Wikidata is key to its widespread adoption and future development. No study has investigated so far to what extent and which aspects of this topic have been addressed. To fill this gap, we surveyed prior literature about data quality in Wikidata. Our analysis includes 28 papers and categorise by quality dimensions addressed. We showed that a number of quality dimensions has not been yet adequately covered, e.g. accuracy and trustworthiness. Future work should focus on these.

 When Humans and Machines Collaborate: Cross-lingual Label Editing in Wikidata   
 February 27, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  When Humans and Machines Collaborate: Cross-lingual Label Editing in Wikidata  
 Authors:  Lucie-Aimée Ka ffee (University of Southampton and TIB Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology), Kemele M Endris (TIB Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology), Elena Simperl (University of Southampton)  
 Abstract:  The quality and maintainability of a knowledge graph are determined by the process in which it is created. There are different approaches to such processes; extraction or conversion of available data in the web (automated extraction of knowledge such as DBpedia from Wikipedia), community-created knowledge graphs, often by a group of experts, and hybrid approaches where humans maintain the knowledge graph alongside bots. We focus in this work on the hybrid approach of human edited knowledge graphs supported by automated tools. In particular, we analyse the editing of natural language data, i.e. labels. Labels are the entry point for humans to understand the information, and therefore need to be carefully maintained. We take a step toward the understanding of collaborative editing of humans and automated tools across languages in a knowledge graph. We use Wikidata as it has a large and active community of humans and bots working together covering over 300 languages. In this work, we analyse the different editor groups and how they interact with the different language data to understand the provenance of the current label data.

 Approving Automation: Analyzing Requests for Permissions of Bots in Wikidata   
 February 26, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Approving Automation: Analyzing Requests for Permissions of Bots in Wikidata  
 Authors:  Mariam Farda-Sarbas (Freie Universitat Berlin), Hong Zhu (Freie Universität Berlin), Marisa Nest (Freie Universität Berlin), Claudia Muller-Birn (Freie Universität Berlin)  
 Abstract:  Wikidata, initially developed to serve as a central structured knowledge base for Wikipedia, is now a melting point for structured data for companies, research projects and other peer production communities. Wikidata’s community consists of humans and bots, and most edits in Wikidata come from these bots. Prior research has raised concerns regarding the challenges for editors to ensure the quality of bot-generated data, such as the lack of quality control and knowledge diversity. In this research work, we provide one way of tackling these challenges by taking a closer look at the approval process of bot activity on Wikidata. We collected all bot requests, i.e. requests for permissions (RfP) from October 2012 to July 2018. We analyzed these 683 bot requests by classifying them regarding activity focus, activity type, and source mentioned. Our results show that the majority of task requests deal with data additions to Wikidata from internal sources, especially from Wikipedia. However, we can also show the existing diversity of external sources used so far. Furthermore, we examined the reasons which caused the unsuccessful closing of RfPs. In some cases, the Wikidata community is reluctant to implement specific bots, even if they are urgently needed because there is still no agreement in the community regarding the technical implementation. This study can serve as a foundation for studies that connect the approved tasks with the editing behavior of bots on Wikidata to understand the role of bots better for quality control and knowledge diversity.

 Dwelling on Wikipedia: Investigating Time Spent by Global Encyclopedia Readers   
 February 25, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Dwelling on Wikipedia: Investigating Time Spent by Global Encyclopedia Readers  
 Authors:  Nathan TeBlunthuis (Wikimedia Foundation), Tilman Bayer (Wikimedia Foundation), Olga Vasileva (Wikimedia Foundation)  
 Abstract:  Much existing knowledge about global consumption of peer-produced information goods is supported by data on Wikipedia page view counts and surveys. In 2017, the Wikimedia Foundation began measuring the time readers spend on a given page view (dwell time), enabling a more detailed understanding of such reading patterns. In this paper, we validate and model this new data source and, building on existing findings, use regression analysis to test hypotheses about how patterns in reading time vary between global contexts. Consistent with prior findings from self-report data, our complementary analysis of behavioral data provides evidence that Global South readers are more likely to use Wikipedia to gain in-depth understanding of a topic. We find that Global South readers spend more time per page view and that this difference is amplified on desktop devices, which are thought to be better suited for in-depth information seeking tasks.

  In 2022, the 18th International Conference on Open Source Systems (OSS) and the 18th International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym) are joining forces and will be held as co-located events.  
 The goal of bringing these two communities together is to make it a holistic forum encompassing all topics related to open collaboration research and practice, including open source, open data, open science, open education, wikis, and related social media, Wikipedia, and IT-driven open innovation research.  
 Open collaboration emerged as one of the most important phenomena in the last decades. More recently, we saw how this global openness helped to respond to an international crisis, the Covid-19 crisis. Researchers from all over the world gathered efforts to find how to manage the pandemic. Synergies have been created, data opened and shared, knowledge disseminated, in order to accelerate research on vaccines and understand the virus behavior.  
 Following this historical situation, we decided to put this edition under the theme:  
 “Openness in Emergency Situations”  
 Open science is at the heart of this theme, including open data and open source tools that enabled this large-scale collaboration. We are interested in understanding cases and research that explore questions like: How “open” can benefit the society in emergency situations? What are the risks assigned to it? What are the processes, tools, and methods implemented to support openness?  
 More broadly, this year more than ever, our conference is about collaborations between people from computer science, information science, management, social science, humanities, and everyone interested in open collaboration and how it is helping and changing the world.  
 How will the CFP and Proceedings work?  
 While we will have a shared program, a single theme, and the same deadlines, we will keep two separate proceedings  . The goal is to keep the specifics of each of the communities in terms of archive and history. Therefore, formatting details and topics of interest are individual to each conference/symposium.  
 The intersection point between these two communities is the topics related to Open Source Software. Therefore, we encourage the authors of papers that touch this specific topic to submit to the OSS Conference.  
 What are the topics of interest?  
 Submitted papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development, and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Research papers will be reviewed to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, conceptual quality, innovation, and clarity of presentation.  
 OSS and OpenSym 2022 will follow their traditions and will cover and welcome topics that are appealing to the advances in their areas of interest. Although we will have a focus on “Openness in Emergency Situations”, all traditional topics will be covered and welcome. For each of the events, a non-comprehensive list of topics of interest is presented below:

  What is the submission process and format?  
 This year we will have a different, more inclusive, submission flow. We will offer the authors the opportunity to receive feedback based on extended abstracts. When submitting the extended abstract, please inform after the title of the paper (in the manuscript) if this refers to a potential full research paper, a new ideas paper, or (in the case of OSS only) a tool paper.  
 The papers accepted as extended abstracts will be invited to submit a full version of their paper which will be further reviewed. However, the authors who do not want to submit their full or new ideas paper (or have them rejected) will have the papers considered as part of the program as well.  
 We summarize this new process in the figure below:  
   For the extended abstracts, the following structure is recommended:  
 Motivation | : including the problem tackled in the paper, justification of the importance of the problem, positioning among the main related work/previous research; 
  Aim | : Highlight the research objectives, hypotheses, and/or research questions 
  Method | : details about the method followed to conduct the research 
  Results | : a summary of the results achieved in the study 
  Conclusion (impact) | : a brief discussion to conclude the paper, focusing on presenting how your findings move the state-of-the-art, showing the contribution of the paper/ highlighting the implications. 
  The extended abstracts maximum length is of 1,000 words  . References do not count in the 1000 words limit, but the number of references is limited to 10. You may also have at most 2 graphic elements (table/figure). It is important to use the format of the conference you are submitting your extended abstract, as follows:  
 OpenSym | : must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template (conference, in the new single-column format). 
  OSS Conference | : must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings. 
  All submissions must present original work, unpublished, and not under submission elsewhere. The authors must clearly explain the contribution of the work in terms of its theoretical and/or practical value and situate it in relation to previous work. The review process for both events is double-blind  , so manuscripts must be anonymized.  
 Papers should be submitted as PDF files at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=opensymandoss2022  , choosing which track you are submitting: OSS or OpenSym. All accepted submissions will be included in their respective conference proceedings—OSS is published by Springer and we are looking for a place to publish OpenSym’s proceedings. The open-access preprints of all accepted submissions will be collected and referenced from the conference website.  
 Authors whose submitted papers have been accepted for presentation at the conference have a choice of  
 having their paper become partof the official conference proceedings. 
  having no publication record at all but only the presentation at the conference. 
  OpenSym  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to OpenSym  must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template  (conference, in the new single-column format). All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of Open Collaboration. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and should be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).  
 Furthermore, we plan to have a Journal Article Collection, to which the best research papers in the conference will be invited to submit an extended version.  
 OSS  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to the OSS Conference  must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings  . All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 OSS conference will accept three kinds of submissions:  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of FLOSS systems. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and will be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | : New Ideas papers may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  Tool papers | : Submissions describing the novel release or original development of software applications, libraries, frameworks, or other FLOSS tools that have a significant user base or have been used to achieve significant practical results. Tool papers are expected to include a validation section showing the usefulness of the presented tools. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).

 Overview  
 The 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. OSDI emphasizes innovative research and quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation.  
 OSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice including operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases. We encourage contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results.  
 Submitting a Paper  
 Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee.  
 A good paper will:  
 Motivate a significant problem 
  Propose an interesting and compelling solution 
  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution 
  Draw appropriate conclusions 
  Clearly describe the paper's contributions 
  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work 
  Submission Scope and Relevance:  The OSDI steering committee, in maintaining a three-decade tradition of a single-track program, is committed to deepening discussions on key computer systems topics. Starting from OSDI '25, there will be a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests.  Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on the topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices in computer systems. Additionally, submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees. By adhering to these criteria, OSDI aims to continue its legacy by focusing on innovative research that addresses pressing needs in the computer systems field.  
 Accepted papers will generally be available online to registered attendees before the conference. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the symposium.  
 Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the OSDI '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of a program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy  for details.  
 Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted as long as the authors have substantially addressed the previous reviewers' comments. If the prior conference's rejection notification has been received less than thirteen months before the OSDI '25 submission deadline, then the authors are requested to provide information regarding the previous submission and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This information should be uploaded via the submission form, and will not be shared with the OSDI '25 reviewers.  
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. The co-chairs may then share that paper with the workshop's organizers and discuss it with them.  
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org  , technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is permitted. However, your OSDI submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts.  
 USENIX discourages program co-chairs from submitting papers to the conferences they organize, although they are allowed to do so. Should either program co-chair submit work to OSDI '25, their papers will be handled exclusively by the other program co-chair and reviewed according to the same rigorous and double-blinded procedures that the program committee applies to all papers. In the event that a paper is co-authored by, or otherwise conflicted with both co-chairs, the co-chairs will designate a PC member to manage the reviewing process for that paper.  
 Questions? Contact your program co-chairs, osdi25chairs@usenix.org  , or the USENIX office, submissionspolicy@usenix.org  .  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  . For very special support circumstances (such as travel restrictions or health issues), USENIX may provide the possibility of remote presentation and Q&A.  
 If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.  
 Deadline and Submission Instructions  
 Authors must register abstracts and submit full papers by the dates indicated above. These are hard deadlines, and no extensions will be given. Submitted papers must be no longer than 12 single-spaced 8.5" x 11" pages, including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, two-column format, Times Roman or a similar font, within a text block 7" wide x 9" deep. Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references. Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible in black and white, without requiring magnification. Papers so short as to be considered "extended abstracts" will not receive full consideration.  
 Supplementary Material  
 Authors may upload supplementary material in files separate from their submissions. PC members are not required to read supplementary material when reviewing the paper, so each paper should stand alone without it. Authors may use this for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Examples of materials that may be included are: formal proofs that are only sketched in the paper; snippets of code that detail an algorithm presented in the paper; and methodological details that are not essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. Importantly, because the PC members are NOT required to read the supplementary material, the submission must stand alone without it. Attaching supplementary material is optional; if your paper says that you have formal proofs or source code, you need not attach them to convince the PC of their existence.  
 Identity Blinding  
 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, contact the program co-chairs, osdi25chairs@usenix.org  , well in advance of the submission deadline.  
 Abstract Registration  
 Registering abstracts a week before paper submission is an essential part of the paper-reviewing process, as PC members use this time to identify which papers they are qualified to review. Abstract registrations that do not provide sufficient information to understand the topic and contribution (e.g., empty abstracts, placeholder abstracts, or trivial abstracts) will be rejected, thereby precluding paper submission.  
 Conflicts  
 When registering your abstract, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if and only if one or more of the following circumstances applies:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the review period.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, program co-chairship, or editorship within the past two years (December 2022 through December 2024).  
 Personal:  You are close family relatives (spouses, domestic partners, parents, or children).  
 You must not identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies. For instance, the following are not sufficient grounds to specify a conflict with a PC member: they have reviewed the work before, they are employed by your competitor, they are your friend, they were your post-doc advisor or advisee, or they had the same advisor as you.  
 The chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding or removing conflicts if necessary. The chairs may reject abstracts or papers on the basis of missing or extraneous conflicts. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs.  
 Authors are also encouraged to contact the program co-chairs, osdi25chairs@usenix.org  , if needed to relate their OSDI submissions to relevant submissions of their own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. The program co-chairs will use this information at their discretion to preserve the anonymity of the review process without jeopardizing the outcome of the current OSDI submission.  
 Papers must be in PDF format and must be submitted via the submission system  . For more details on the submission process, and for templates to use with LaTeX, Word, etc., authors should consult the detailed submission requirements  .  
 SUBMIT YOUR WORK    
 Author Response Period  
 OSDI will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting, during the dates shown above. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow.  
 Submission of a response is optional. The response can be of any length up to 2000 words. A shorter and crisper response is often advantageous, while a response longer than 2000 words is prohibited.  
 Revise and Resubmit  
 OSDI '25 will continue the option to revise and resubmit for some of the rejected papers. If a paper is given this option as indicated in the notification, authors will be provided with a list of issues to address. Authors may then resubmit a revised version with a response to the issues. If accepted, the paper will be presented at OSDI '25.

  In 2022, the 18th International Conference on Open Source Systems (OSS) and the 18th International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym) are joining forces and will be held as co-located events.  
 The goal of bringing these two communities together is to make it a holistic forum encompassing all topics related to open collaboration research and practice, including open source, open data, open science, open education, wikis, and related social media, Wikipedia, and IT-driven open innovation research.  
 Open collaboration emerged as one of the most important phenomena in the last decades. More recently, we saw how this global openness helped to respond to an international crisis, the Covid-19 crisis. Researchers from all over the world gathered efforts to find how to manage the pandemic. Synergies have been created, data opened and shared, knowledge disseminated, in order to accelerate research on vaccines and understand the virus behavior.  
 Following this historical situation, we decided to put this edition under the theme:  
 “Openness in Emergency Situations”  
 Open science is at the heart of this theme, including open data and open source tools that enabled this large-scale collaboration. We are interested in understanding cases and research that explore questions like: How “open” can benefit the society in emergency situations? What are the risks assigned to it? What are the processes, tools, and methods implemented to support openness?  
 More broadly, this year more than ever, our conference is about collaborations between people from computer science, information science, management, social science, humanities, and everyone interested in open collaboration and how it is helping and changing the world.  
 How will the CFP and Proceedings work?  
 While we will have a shared program, a single theme, and the same deadlines, we will keep two separate proceedings  . The goal is to keep the specifics of each of the communities in terms of archive and history. Therefore, formatting details and topics of interest are individual to each conference/symposium.  
 The intersection point between these two communities is the topics related to Open Source Software. Therefore, we encourage the authors of papers that touch this specific topic to submit to the OSS Conference.  
 What are the topics of interest?  
 Submitted papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development, and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Research papers will be reviewed to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, conceptual quality, innovation, and clarity of presentation.  
 OSS and OpenSym 2022 will follow their traditions and will cover and welcome topics that are appealing to the advances in their areas of interest. Although we will have a focus on “Openness in Emergency Situations”, all traditional topics will be covered and welcome. For each of the events, a non-comprehensive list of topics of interest is presented below:

  What is the submission process and format?  
 This year we will have a different, more inclusive, submission flow. We will offer the authors the opportunity to receive feedback based on extended abstracts. When submitting the extended abstract, please inform after the title of the paper (in the manuscript) if this refers to a potential full research paper, a new ideas paper, or (in the case of OSS only) a tool paper.  
 The papers accepted as extended abstracts will be invited to submit a full version of their paper which will be further reviewed. However, the authors who do not want to submit their full or new ideas paper (or have them rejected) will have the papers considered as part of the program as well.  
 We summarize this new process in the figure below:  
   For the extended abstracts, the following structure is recommended:  
 Motivation | : including the problem tackled in the paper, justification of the importance of the problem, positioning among the main related work/previous research; 
  Aim | : Highlight the research objectives, hypotheses, and/or research questions 
  Method | : details about the method followed to conduct the research 
  Results | : a summary of the results achieved in the study 
  Conclusion (impact) | : a brief discussion to conclude the paper, focusing on presenting how your findings move the state-of-the-art, showing the contribution of the paper/ highlighting the implications. 
  The extended abstracts maximum length is of 1,000 words  . References do not count in the 1000 words limit, but the number of references is limited to 10. You may also have at most 2 graphic elements (table/figure). It is important to use the format of the conference you are submitting your extended abstract, as follows:  
 OpenSym | : must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template (conference, in the new single-column format). 
  OSS Conference | : must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings. 
  All submissions must present original work, unpublished, and not under submission elsewhere. The authors must clearly explain the contribution of the work in terms of its theoretical and/or practical value and situate it in relation to previous work. The review process for both events is double-blind  , so manuscripts must be anonymized.  
 Papers should be submitted as PDF files at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=opensymandoss2022  , choosing which track you are submitting: OSS or OpenSym. All accepted submissions will be included in their respective conference proceedings—OSS is published by Springer and we are looking for a place to publish OpenSym’s proceedings. The open-access preprints of all accepted submissions will be collected and referenced from the conference website.  
 Authors whose submitted papers have been accepted for presentation at the conference have a choice of  
 having their paper become partof the official conference proceedings. 
  having no publication record at all but only the presentation at the conference. 
  OpenSym  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to OpenSym  must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template  (conference, in the new single-column format). All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of Open Collaboration. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and should be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).  
 Furthermore, we plan to have a Journal Article Collection, to which the best research papers in the conference will be invited to submit an extended version.  
 OSS  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to the OSS Conference  must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings  . All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 OSS conference will accept three kinds of submissions:  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of FLOSS systems. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and will be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | : New Ideas papers may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  Tool papers | : Submissions describing the novel release or original development of software applications, libraries, frameworks, or other FLOSS tools that have a significant user base or have been used to achieve significant practical results. Tool papers are expected to include a validation section showing the usefulness of the presented tools. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).
