1. Conference EuroSys_1:
Call for Papers  
 EuroSys 2025 will adopt a dual-deadline format -- dates for both deadlines are shown below. Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at EuroSys 2025  
 The European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys) is a premier international forum for presenting computer systems research. This 20th edition of EuroSys will be jointly organized with ASPLOS 2025   . I.e. the conferences will be co-located and there will be a shared registration fee. To find out more about submitting a paper to ASPLOS 2025, please refer to their website  .  
 EuroSys 2025 seeks papers on all areas of computer systems research, including:  
 Operating systems 
  Distributed systems 
  Cloud computing and datacenter systems 
  File and storage systems 
  Networked systems 
  Language support and runtime systems 
  Systems security and privacy 
  Dependable systems 
  Analysis, testing and verification of systems 
  Database systems and data analytics frameworks 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems 
  Mobile and pervasive systems 
  Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems 
  Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems 
  Systems for emerging hardware 
   
 We encourage papers that span multiple topics and communities. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance correctness, and clarity. The program committee seeks papers that address a significant problem with an interesting and compelling solution whose validity and practicality are clearly demonstrated. A good paper will draw appropriate conclusions, honestly present related prior work, acknowledge its own limitations and clearly articulate the advances it offers over prior work.  
 Important dates  
  EuroSys 2025 will adopt a dual-deadline format. Deadline dates for the two submission periods are shown below. Accepted papers from both submission periods will be presented at EuroSys 2025. All deadlines are AoE time   .

 Two Deadlines  
 EuroSys 2025 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by EuroSys, for example listing them on CVs.  
 A paper submitted at the spring deadline for EuroSys 2025 and rejected may not be submitted again until the spring deadline for EuroSys 2026. A paper submitted at the fall deadline for EuroSys 2025 and rejected may not be submitted again until the fall deadline for EuroSys 2026.  
 Revision  
 Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. If offered a revision option, authors can choose to revise and resubmit the paper for the subsequent EuroSys deadline. This will be the EuroSys 2025 fall deadline if offered a revision from a spring submission. If offered a revision from the fall submission, authors may revise and resubmit to the subsequent (EuroSys 2026) spring deadline for publication (if accepted) and presentation at EuroSys 2026.  
 Authors offered a revision option will be given detailed instructions about how to re-submit. These will include the list of necessary changes for the paper to be accepted. These may include larger changes than during the shepherding process for accepted papers, e.g. additional results or performance comparisons that match the message of the paper. The re-submission should include the revised paper, a version of the paper in which the differences from the first submission are clearly marked, and a separate high-level summary of the differences between the two versions.  
 A revision option is not a guarantee of acceptance. The revised and resubmitted paper will be re-evaluated by the PC. The paper can still be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed; if new assertions are made without adequate support; or if the revised version unveils significant new concerns that were hidden in the original submission. Revised and resubmitted papers will receive either an accept or a reject decision; there will be no further revision options offered. If accepted, the paper will be subject to the usual shepherding of EuroSys.  
  Note  : at least one full registration  fee (member or non-member) will be required for each  paper accepted at the plenary conference, even if the presenter is eligible for a student fee.  
  Resubmission and concurrent submission  
 Authors submitting to EuroSys must adhere to ACM's policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  . If a revision option is offered and accepted, the paper is still considered under submission to EuroSys and still subject to this policy until it is explicitly withdrawn or rejected. If a revision option is offered and declined, the same policy applies as for a rejection.  
 If a paper initially submitted to the spring deadline of EuroSys 2025 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the fall deadline of EuroSys 2026. If a paper initially submitted to the fall deadline of EuroSys 2025 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the spring deadline of EuroSys 2027.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Spring Submission URL:  https://eurosys25.hotcrp.com/   
 Fall Submission URL:  https://eurosys25-fall.hotcrp.com/   
 Anonymity  : Reviewing is double-blind, meaning that the authors‘ identities will be hidden from the reviewers and vice versa. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say “Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Smith et al. [17]”.  
 A submission may extend a previous workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently under review. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your present submission and the other work, but you should cite the other work anonymously and submit the anonymized work in a designated field in hotcrp (visible only to the PC chairs).  
 Authors are permitted to post drafts of their submission on e.g. arxiv or as technical reports on their institution’s website. However, the submitted version should have a substantially different title, and a different system/tool name (if it uses one) from the draft version.  
 Authors are welcome to include links to code repositories in their papers. However, authors should ensure that following the link and exploring the repository does not reveal any information about the names of the authors or their affiliations.  
 Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. EuroSys applies ACM‘s policies for plagiarism conflicts of interest, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, whether or not your submissions meet these guidelines, or have specific questions about the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs, eurosys25-pc-chairs@eurosys.org  , well in advance of the submission deadline.  
 Benchmarking:  Please review your submissions to avoid the list of Systems Benchmarking Crimes (https://gernot-heiser.org/benchmarking-crimes.html)  .  
 Generative AI:  Please review the ACM Policy on Authorship (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)  which contains information on the use of generative AI in preparing submissions.  
 Conflicts  : When registering and submitting your paper, you will need to provide information about conflicts with PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institution | : You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. 
  Advisor or Collaboration | : You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee, or you have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (2022 or later), or reasonably expect one within the next year. 
   
 A textbox will be provided on the submission page to explain any concerns about conflicts of interest. More details on the conflict of interest policy can be found at the ACM website  .  
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper may lead to the submission being rejected without review. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program chairs ( eurosys25-pc-chairs@eurosys.org  ).  
 Page limit and formatting  : Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. In addition, submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for supplementary material in a separate file, which can be uploaded at a separate place on the submission site. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material or appendices included in the paper when reviewing the submission.  
 Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by ≥8 mm (0.33″) of whitespace. Use ≥10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on ≥12-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered. Authors are encouraged to hyperlink their references.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex (\documentclass[sigplan, … ]) or MS Word templates from here  . For any paper parameters not defined above, assume that the required value is the one used in these templates.  
 Papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.  
 For Latex, we recommend you use (where <PAPER_ID> is the paper ID you received after abstract registration):  
 \documentclass[sigplan,twocolumn,review,anonymous]{acmart} \acmSubmissionID{<PAPER ID>} \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} % Optional: Remove the ACM reference between the abstract and the main text. \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printacmref=false} % Optional: Comment out the CCS concepts and keywords. ...  Revision submissions  
 If you are submitting a revised paper because you received a revise-and-resubmit decision from the previous deadline, you should already have received instructions by e-mail on how to prepare the revision submission. At submission time please tick the appropriate box in HotCRP for the fall submission, and also provide the required additional information (spring submission paper #, supplemental material, and summary of revision).  
 Author response  
 Author responses will be strictly limited to 1000 words. Providing a response in a pdf file (in which the number of words is not easy to detect) or inlining documents such as revised figures into the response will result in the response being removed. Accepted papers and artifact evaluation  
 Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process.

 EuroVA 2024  
 Workshop   
 EuroVA 2024 ( eurova.org/eurova-2024  ) is the fourteenth international EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics.  
 It will take place on Monday, May 27, 2024, in Odense, Denmark, and is co-located with Eurovis 2024, the Eurographics Conference on Visualization ( eurovis.org  ).  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making approach that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, uncertain, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, data science, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, cognitive and perceptual sciences.  
 EuroVA 2024 is the premier workshop in Europe to present and discuss fresh ideas on new methods and theories, novel applications, designs, and studies on the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a wide range of contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including novel techniques, systems, applications, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, as well as fresh viewpoints on future challenges and critical reflections.  
  EuroVA proceedings will be published in the EG Digital Library  . EuroVA is also indexed in dblp  and Scopus.

 EuroVA 2022  
 Special: call for your questions about Visual Analytics  , to be discussed in a special session at EuroVA2022!  
 Workshop  
 EuroVA 2022 is the 13th international EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics.  
 It will take place on Monday, June 13, 2022  , in Rome, Italy, and is co-located with Eurovis 2022, the Eurographics Conference on Visualization ( https://www.eurovis.org/  ).  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making approach that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, uncertain, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, data science, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, and cognitive and perceptual sciences.  
 EuroVA 2022 is the premier workshop in Europe to present and discuss fresh ideas on new methods and theories, novel applications, designs, and studies on the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a wide range of contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including novel techniques, systems, applications, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, as well as fresh viewpoints on future challenges and critical reflections.  
  EuroVA proceedings will be published in the EG Digital Library  . From 2020 EuroVA is also indexed in Scopus. Following the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to a special issue of a journal (Computer & Graphics or similar tier journal). Further details will be announced soon.

 Welcome to EuroVis 2025   
   
 The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).   
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization  .  
 Since its inception in 1999 as a symposium, and its elevation to a full conference in 2012, EuroVis has grown to become one of the leading platforms for advancing visualization research and applications across Europe.  
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of today’s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data.  
 EuroVis 2025 aims to foster collaboration between visualization researchers and practitioners from across disciplines. The conference provides a unique platform for sharing groundbreaking research, building networks, and inspiring new research directions. With its broadened scope to encompass all areas of data visualization, EuroVis continues to expand its impact both within Europe and globally.  
 The main conference will be preceded by a series of co-located workshops and events, which will be held on June 2, 2025, at the same venue.  
 Join us for an enriching and inspiring experience in the heart of Luxembourg City!

 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism.  
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests.  
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.  
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site:  
 https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html   

 PLAN S COMPLIANCE   
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following:  
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
  Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis  

 USAGE OF AI

 USEFLULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES   
   
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   
 The maximum length for submitted papers to the full papers track is 10 pages (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references).  
 References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Papers exceeding the maximum allowed number of pages will be automatically rejected.  
 Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template for full papers https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip  ) which includes a sample document explaining the required format LaTeX2e Style template.  
 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism.  
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests.  
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.  
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site:  
 https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html   

 PLAN S COMPLIANCE   
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following:  
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
  Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis

  STARs 

 State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs)   
   
 State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs) are intended to provide up-to-date and comprehensive surveys on topics of interest to the visualization research community. We encourage the submission of STARs on topics that have not yet been covered in any recent STAR or other survey [1].  
 We welcome submissions that introduce emerging areas of research that are of relevance and interest to visualization research, as well as proposals on more traditional visualization topics. We also welcome contributions from related disciplines and application areas demonstrating contributions to, or benefits from, the area of visualization including, but not limited to, visual computing, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, image processing, computer vision, psychology, geography, chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, data analysis, computational sciences, medicine, biology, economy, social science, etc. All accepted EuroVis STAR reports will be published in the Computer Graphics Forum journal   .  

 Important Dates   

 Submission of STAR Sketch | Invitation for full STAR submission | Submission of full STAR | Full STAR notification | Second round submission | Second review notification | Camera-ready deadline 
 October 14, 2024 (two pages, +references, +bibliography) | November 4, 2024 | January 13, 2025 | March 10, 2025 | March 31, 2025 | April 14, 2025 | April 28, 2025 

 USEFULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES   
   
 INSTRUCTIONS   
 As part of the acceptance process for Computer Graphics Forum, STARs will undergo a multi-stage review process  where authors first submit a 2-page STAR Sketch that they receive preliminary feedback on, followed by a full STAR submission. Submission of the STAR Sketch and full report is mandatory and will be conducted using the Precision Conference System ( PCS  ). For detailed paper preparation and submission instructions please refer to the submission guidelines  below.  
 Upon acceptance, we aim to schedule each STAR as an approximately 45 minute presentation (subject to the schedule management of the EuroVis 2025 program). In any circumstance, a STAR presentation will be given a longer time slot than that of a full paper.  

 STAR SKETCH SUBMISSION   
 A STAR Sketch briefly describes the planned STAR by outlining the topic, discussing its relevance to the visualization community, providing the planned structure and outline of the STAR together with all key references, and short biographies of the authors. The length of a STAR Sketch main text is limited to two pages  . To demonstrate the relevant expertise needed to produce the proposed STAR, brief biographies of all authors are required as supplementary material. References and short biographies are considered supplementary pages and are not counted within the two page limit. Authors receive feedback on their sketches to help improve the submission and to inform their decisions whether to progress to the Full STAR submission stage.  

 FULL STAR SUBMISSION   
 In the next stage, authors are required to submit a full STAR. There is no strict maximum length for full submissions. However, it is unusual for STARs to exceed 20 pages (excluding references). Full STAR submissions will then undergo a single blind, two-stage review process, similar to that of regular papers submitted to Computer Graphics Forum, where 3-4 external experts on the respective topic will evaluate the STAR.  

 STAR CHAIRS   
 Marco Angelini,  University of Rome, Italy  
 Christoph Garth,  University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, Germany  
 Andreas Kerren,  Linköping University, Sweden  
 For any questions concerning State-of-the-Art Report submissions, please contact the STAR chairs at stars@eurovis.org   

 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 Since all accepted STARs will be published in Computer Graphics Forum, the submission process uses a multiple-stage reviewing process. The submission procedure is as follows:  
 Submit a STAR Sketch by | October 14th, 2024. | The length of a STAR Sketch main text is limited to | 2 pages | . 
  References and short biographies are considered supplementary pages and are not counted within the two-page limit. The format of the sketch should follow the format specified in the formatting instructions for the STAR below. STAR Sketches will be reviewed by the STAR IPC and comments on suitability and relevance will be provided on November 4th, 2024  .  
 According to the feedback given by the IPC members, the authors can submit a full STAR by | January 13th, 2025 | . 
  The requirements for EuroVis 2025 STARs follow the EUROGRAPHICS policy on STAR length. We do not impose strict maximum lengths for submitted STARs.  However, it is unusual for STARs to exceed 20 pages  (in CGF latex style) including all figures and tables, but excluding references  . There is no limit as to the number of references or the number of pages for references. STARs should only be as long as their content justifies. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. To submit, please go to “submissions in progress” on PCS   .  
 Full STAR submissions will then undergo a single blind, two-stage review process, similar to that of regular papers submitted to Computer Graphics Forum, where 3-4 external experts on the respective topic will evaluate the STAR.  
 Once your full STAR submission has been accepted or conditionally accepted, submit your revised version together with a cover letter detailing your changes by March 31th, 2025  . To do so, please go to “submissions in progress” in PCS   . The camera-ready version is due on April 28nd, 2025.   

 FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS   
 The sketch as well as the full version submission of the STAR should be submitted as a PDF file using the EuroVis 2025 LaTeX2e Style template. The template can be downloaded here  .  On Overleaf, this template can be imported easily by selecting “New Project” -> “Upload Project” and uploading the zip file. Use EGauthorGuidelines-eurovis25-star.tex  for your submission.  
 Please make sure that images embedded in your paper do not contain transparent pixels (i.e., an alpha channel of a transparent color), because this will lead to problems when the resulting PDF is displayed or printed.  
 Submissions can also include supplementary material such as videos or executable programs. The server will accept uploads of at most 200 MB, so multiple files of over 200 MB must be submitted separately. Please use only the most common video codecs (e.g., MP4 format using the H.264 codec) to maximize the chances that the reviewers can see it.  
 STAR Sketches and full STARs are submitted using the Precision Conference Submission System ( PCS   ).  

 CAMERA READY VERSION   
 In order to submit the camera ready version to EuroVis 2025, authors should prepare their submissions as a PDF file using the EuroVis 2025 LaTeX2e Style. Please ensure that the option \SpecialIssuePaper is used.  
 Authors of accepted papers are also requested to fill in the Exclusive License Agreement   (one per paper) and send the signed document to s.behnke@eg.org.  
 Common mistakes when creating the final version of the paper are:  
 Headlines are too long: | besides the running headlines, there has to be space for the page numbers. Please shorten the headline to accommodate for page numbers. 
  Formatting of figure captions: | “ | Figure <number>: | ” should be bold, and the caption should be set in italics. This is often caused by overwriting the default settings when using the figure, caption, or subfigure packages. Try using: \captionsetup{labelfont=bf,textfont=it}) 

 AUTHOR GUIDELINES   
 A state-of-the-art report submitted to EuroVis 2025 must be original, unpublished work. Any work that has previously been published or has simultaneously been submitted in a substantially similar form to any other conference or journal will be rejected.  
 All STARs accepted to EuroVis 2025 appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics Digital Library.  
 At EuroVis 2025, the authors of a STAR will be invited to present their report at a level that also allows non-experts in the particular domain to follow. We plan to schedule each STAR as an approximate 45-minute presentation (subject to the schedule management of the EuroVis 2025 program, but ensuring that STAR presentations will be given a longer time slot than those of full papers). At least one author of an accepted paper must register and attend the conference to present the work, and authors “ will also be required to submit a 25-second video preview(TBC)”   summarizing their work and eventually present a brief (less than one-minute) summary of their talk at the opening papers preview session (also called papers fast-forward).  
 Contributions must be written and presented in English.

 USEFLULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES   
   
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   
 The maximum length for submitted papers to the full papers track is 10 pages (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references).  
 References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Papers exceeding the maximum allowed number of pages will be automatically rejected.

 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism.  
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests.  
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.  
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site:  
 https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html   

 PLAN S COMPLIANCE   
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following:  
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
  Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis  

 USAGE OF AI

 About EUSPN 2024   
 The 15th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN-2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks related areas. The EUSPN-2024 will be held in Leuven, Belgium on October 28-30, 2024. The EUSPN-2024 will be held in conjunction with the 14th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH-2024)  .  
 Leuven  is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world.  
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures.

  CCS supports the EUSPN International Conference in Various Capacities  
 Feb 19 2024   
 The College of Computer Studies (CCS) supported and made marks at the 14th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN) in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  
 Under Special Order No. 01062-IIT, S. 2023, Dr. Orven E. Llantos of the Department of Computer Science, College of Computer Studies (CCS) successfully carried out his role as the Track Chair of Systems Software Engineering at the EUSPN International Conference on November 7-9 2023 at Almaty, Kazakhstan.  
 “The 14th International Conference on EUSPN is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results, and practical development experiences from all Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks related areas,” said the official event web page ( https://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/euspn-23/  ). The accepted papers will be published under Procedia Computer Science, indexed by Scopus with a high CiteScore of 4.0. A published paper indexed in Scopus indicates high-quality scientific research content.  
 Dr. Llantos is accompanied by renowned research colleagues in the country and abroad. They are:  
 Dr. Giuseppe D'Aniello, University of Salerno, Italy 
  Dr. Kennedy Ehimwenma, Wenzhou-Kean University, China 
  Dr. Adrian Galido, MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology, Philippines 
  Dr. Giuseppe Sansonetti, Roma Tre University, Italy 
  Dr. Roderick Tabalba, University of Hawaii at Manoa, United States 
  Dr. May Marie P. Talandron-Felipe, University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines Philippines 
  The team successfully conducted their roles by reviewing submitted papers and recommending the acceptance/rejection based on the submitted paper’s quality by aspiring researchers wishing to join the conference.  
   
 On the other hand, the undergraduate paper entitled: “Bundle AI: An Application of Multiple Constraint Knapsack Problem (MCKP) Through Genetic Algorithm” was accepted by the EUSPN conference under the Adaptive Systems, Intelligent Computing, and Applications (AISICA) Track. The authors are Angel Nicole Carloman, Urel Van William Bermudo, and Eires Marc Estilloso, all BS Computer Science students.  
   
 Meanwhile, a paper entitled “Vaccimon Device: A Design and Development of Vaccine Carrier Monitoring Device for COVID-19 Vaccines” is under review at the 13th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH 2023), a collocated conference with EUSPN 2023. Even though the paper status is still under review, none of the five reviewers rejected the paper. The paper is part of the thesis output from a graduating MS Computer Applications student, Paul Harriet Asinero.  
   
 All the submitted papers are the product of the students with their mentor and adviser, Dr. Orven E. Llantos. With these contributions, it is expected that the CCS will increase the research productivity output while also showing the capacity of the CCS as a Program Chair in international conferences—the CCS way of influencing the future.

 Call for EvoApplications Special Sessions  
  
 EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, invites you to submit a special session proposal to be part of its 28th edition. Special sessions are at the heart of EvoApplications, offering the possibility to gather the community around a particular aspect or application domain of Evolutionary Computation with the aim of fostering and strengthening scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.  
 Special session organizers should do their best to publicize and attract high-quality papers to their sessions. They will also be granted permission to access the reviewing system, where they will assist in the reviewing process. Finally, during the conference, they will be in charge of animating and chairing the special session.  
 EvoApplications provides the infrastructure for the website, the submission system as well as a programme committee of experts in different domain areas. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoApplications, published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the EvoApplications program committee. Note that organizers and participants must register for the conference.  
 Submission Instruction   
 Each special session proposal should include:  
 A short and descriptive title for the special session. 
  A description of the scope and the topics of interest of the special session (up to 400 words). 
  Name, affiliation and emails of the organizer(s). We encourage proposals with two organizers. Otherwise, please justify the need for more people. 
  The title and authors of two or more tentative papers to be submitted to the special session. 
  Proposals should be submitted by e-mail to the EvoApplications 2025 Conference Chairs:  
 Emma Hart   
  Edinburgh Napier University, UK  
  Email  : E.Hart(at)napier.ac.uk  
 Pablo García-Sánchez  
   University of Granada, Spain  
  Email  : pablogarcia(at)ugr.es  
 Proposal submission deadline:  September 8, 2024  
 Notification of session acceptance:  Proposals will be reviewed as they arrive by the EvoApplications organizing committee. Decisions will be made in a few working days. The acceptance criteria will be based on the quality of the proposal, its interest to the community and the possible degree of overlap with other special sessions already accepted.

   The 25th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains.  
 Successfully solved problems include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, stringology, graphs, satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, planning and search-based software engineering.  
 Successfully addressed theoretical and translational challenges encompass, but are not limited to, the development and analysis of novel (components of) evolutionary and other metaheuristic algorithms, work on neighbourhood and landscape structures, problem-agnostic and problem-specific variation operators, parallelisation strategies, and hybridizations. ⁠  
 The EvoCOP 2025 conference will be held together with EuroGP (the 28th European Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (the 14th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 28th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar (Evo*).  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Previous proceedings can be found in the EvoCOP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink  .  
 Download the CFP in PDF here  .  
 Areas of Interest and Contributions   
 EvoCOP welcomes submissions in all experimental and theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation and other metaheuristics to combinatorial optimisation problems, including (but not limited to) the following areas:  
 Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems 
  Theoretical developments 
  Neighbourhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them 
  Variation operators for stochastic search methods 
  Constraint-handling techniques 
  Parallelisation and grid computing 
  Search space and landscape analyses 
  Comparisons between different (also exact) methods 
  Automatic algorithm configuration and design 
  Prominent examples of metaheuristics include (but are not limited to):  
 Evolutionary algorithms 
  Estimation of distribution algorithms 
  Swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm optimisation 
  Artificial immune systems 
  Local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path relinking 
  Hybrid methods such as memetic algorithms 
  Matheuristics (hybrids of exact and heuristic methods) 
  Hyper-heuristics and autonomous search 
  Surrogate-model-based methods 
  Notice that, by tradition, continuous/numerical optimisation is *not* part of the topics of interest of EvoCOP. Interested authors might consider submitting to other EvoStar conferences such as EvoApplications.

  Submission Details  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper  .  
 Page limit  : 14 + unlimited references pages OR 6 + unlimited references pages  
 If your paper has at most 6 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it a short paper. If your paper has between 7 and 14 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it as a full paper. In case of acceptance, a short paper will get a shorter time slot for presentation at EvoCOP than a full paper; exact durations are yet to be decided.  
 Follow these instructions  to submit a paper.

   The 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design (EvoMUSART) 2025 is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers who are working on the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques in creative and artistic fields.  
 There is a growing interest in the application of Artificial Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, Cellular Automata, Alife, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques in fields such as: visual art and music generation, analysis, and interpretation; sound synthesis; architecture; video; poetry; design; and other creative tasks. Therefore, the use of Artificial Intelligence in such creative domains became a significant and exciting area of research. EvoMUSART provides the opportunity to present, discuss and promote innovative contributions and ongoing work in the area.  
 Following the success of previous events and the importance of the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to music, sound, art and design, EvoMUSART has been an evo* conference with independent proceedings since 2012. The EvoMUSART proceedings  have been published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

 Considered a subfield of computational intelligence focused on combinatorial optimisation problems, evolutionary computation is associated with systems that use computational models of evolutionary processes as the key elements in design and implementation, i.e. computational techniques which are based to some degree on the evolution of biological life in the natural world. A number of evolutionary computational models have been proposed, including evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, the evolution strategy, evolutionary programming and swarm intelligence. These techniques form the basis of several disciplines such as artificial life and evolutionary robotics.  
  This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields.    

 Publications:     
  All papers presented at the conference venue  
  will be available at the SCITEPRESS Digital Library

 Call For Papers  
 Last updated on June 28, 2024  

 Conflict of Interest  
 The program co-chairs are seeking collaboration from authors and PC members to avoid having papers reviewed by individuals with a conflict of interest (CoI). PC members will need to point out possible CoIs during the bidding phase. Meanwhile, authors will be prompted during submission to identify any PC members they have CoIs with and to specify the nature of those CoIs.  
  
 This means a CoI exists if an author and a PC member:  
 are currently affiliated with the same institution; 
  have previously had a supervisor/PhD student dynamic; 
  have co-authored or collaborated in the past two years; 
  have or had a financial tie within the last two years; 
  are related or share a close personal friendship. 
   
 If there are other types of conflicts not listed, authors should reach out to the chairs to discuss and clarify the potential issue.  
  
 PC members, including the program co-chairs, with conflicts of interest related to a submission will not participate in its discussion or review. Additionally, authors are obligated to inform the PC Chairs of any situations or reasons that might compromise or potentially sway professional judgment.  
  
 The chairs hold the authority to seek additional clarification and may choose to dismiss non-critical conflicts based on their judgement.  

 How to submit your paper  
 Papers submitted need to use the LNCS format   from the start. They should be no longer than 16 pages in a 10-point font, not counting references and clearly marked appendices, and should not go over 20 pages in total. While the committee might not read the appendices, the main paper should make sense without them. All papers should be in English.  
  
 Submit your papers to this EasyChair link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esorics2024     
  
 EasyChair - how to Submit     
  
 We are only accepting PDF formats. Your submissions will not be anonymous.   
 If your submission does not follow these rules, it might be rejected without a review. If your paper is accepted, you will need to agree to Springer LNCS copyright terms and make sure your paper is presented at the conference.   

 Paper submissions  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings. Papers that either lack originality, clarity in presentation, fall outside the scope of this call for papers or were already rejected in the first review cycle, might be rejected without a review. Authors will be promptly informed in such cases.  

 Topics of Interest  
  
 We are actively seeking contributions in all realms of computer security. This encompasses a broad spectrum, including but not restricted to:  

 Seeking submissions of premier, novel, and previously unreleased research papers! The Symposium will start on September 16, 2024 with an exciting technical program.  
 This includes rigorously reviewed papers, keynote addresses and the associated workshops.

 Conference dates | Tue-Fri, December 10-13, 2024 

 SUBMISSION DETAILS  
 Any paper submitted to EWSN 2024 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and not currently under review by any other conference or journal. All submissions in scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria.  
 The conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). All papers should present original research in the scope described above. No submission should have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles will be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” in the final proceedings. Note that EWSN 2024 intends to accept a small number of Short Papers to be presented together in a single dedicated session of the conference. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category as part of the review process.  
 EWSN 2024 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. To promote early dissemination, submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e.,  
 You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of the authors within the posted version. 
  You MAY NOT reference this arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN (this is one half of the cross-citation restriction). 
  You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in the arxiv paper (this is the other half of the cross-citation restriction). 
  You MAY reference the arxiv paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
  You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
  Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use "accepted, to appear" until the conference actually happens). 
  Submission will be via HotCRP: https://ewsn24.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.  
 Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers.  
  Should the program chairs deem this revision to be sufficient, the paper will be considered as a new submission for the summer cycle. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review.  
 Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the ACM templates for convenience (e.g., on Overleaf here  ).  
 All accepted conference and workshop papers, as well as poster, demo, PhD forum, and competition abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.  
 Generous cash awards sponsored by the Technology Innovation Institute  will be provided to the best paper, best paper runner-up, and the best presentation award.

 Overview  
 The 23rd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '25) brings together researchers and practitioners to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of systems related to storage. The program committee interprets storage-related systems broadly: submissions on low-level storage devices, distributed storage systems, information and data management, as well as other systems interconnected with storage are all of interest. The conference will consist of technical presentations including refereed papers and poster sessions.

  Submission Instructions  
 Please submit your short and long papers by 11:59 pm PDT on September 17, 2024  , in PDF format via the submission form  . Do not email submissions. There is no separate deadline for abstract submissions.  
 The complete submission must be | no longer than 12 pages for long papers | and | no longer than 6 pages | for short papers, | excluding references. The program committee values conciseness: if you can express an idea in fewer pages than the limit, do so. 
  Supplemental material is optional and may be added (if deemed really necessary) as a single separate PDF file without page limits. However, the reviewers are not required to read or consider such material. All content that should be considered to judge the paper is not supplemental and should be part of the main submitted file. 
  Papers must be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two columns using 10-point Times Roman font on 12-point leading (single-spaced), within a text block 7" wide by 9" deep. 
  Labels, captions, and other text in figures, graphs, and tables must use font sizes that, when printed, do not require magnification to be legible. References must not be set in a smaller font. Submissions that violate these requirements will not be reviewed. Limits will be enforced strictly. No extensions will be given for reformatting. 
  A LaTeX template and style file are available on the | USENIX templates page | . 
  Double-blind policy: Authors must not be identified in the submissions, either explicitly or by implication. To refer to your previous work, consider it as written by a third party. Do not say "reference removed for blind review." Supplemental material must be anonymized. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact the program co-chairs, | fast25chairs@usenix.org | , well in advance of the submission deadline. 
  Prior Workshop Paper Policy: If a submission extends a prior workshop paper, please include an anonymized copy of the workshop paper as supplemental material. This should be the same as the published version, with any identifying information removed. 
  Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the | USENIX Conference Submissions Policy | for details. 
  If you are uncertain whether your submission meets USENIX's guidelines, contact the program co-chairs, | fast25chairs@usenix.org | , or the USENIX office, | submissionspolicy@usenix.org | . 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. 
  Submissions should abide by the Conflict Identification guidelines (see below). 
  The program committee and external reviewers will judge papers on technical merit, significance, relevance, and presentation. Research papers on new and unexplored problems are encouraged. A good research paper:  
 addresses a significant problem; 
  presents an interesting, compelling solution; 
  demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of the solution; 
  draws appropriate conclusions using sound experimental methods; 
  clearly describes what the authors have done; and 
  clearly articulates the advances beyond previous work. 
  Program committee members, USENIX, and the broader community generally value a paper more highly if it is accompanied by artifacts not previously available. These artifacts may include traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work.  
 Blind reviewing of all papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees when necessary. Accepted papers will be shepherded by a member of the program committee.  
 Short Papers  
 This year, in addition to long papers (up to 12 pages), FAST also solicits short papers (up to 6 pages long). Just like full-length papers, short papers should describe completed  research where the problem statement proposed solution, and evaluation are all logically complete and conclusions are drawn. While short papers are held to the same high standards as long papers, they tend to comprise smaller contributions that require a shorter description and less analysis than in full papers.  
 We emphasize that papers that describe early-stage research that is not yet fully evaluated are not suitable for this short-paper category.  That is, preliminary or work-in-progress papers generally considered in workshops such as HotStorage do not fall within the scope of short papers.  
 For short papers, the title should be prefixed with "Short Paper: "  , followed by the title. The prefix will not be published in the proceedings and short papers will not be called out as such in the program. Authors must also indicate that they are submitting a short paper by checking the appropriate checkbox on the submission form. The program committee will not accept a full paper on the condition that it is cut down to fit in the short paper page limit, nor will it invite short papers to be extended to full length. Submissions will be considered only in the category in which they are submitted.  
 To see examples of qualified short papers, we encourage authors to browse short papers accepted at prior FAST conferences—from 2012 to 2020. Short papers will be published in the proceedings, and authors will be allocated a shorter speaking slot during the conference.  
 Deployed-Systems Papers  
 In addition to papers that describe original research, FAST also solicits papers that describe real operational systems, including systems currently in production. Such papers should address experience with the practical design implementation, analysis, deployment, or operation of such systems. We encourage the submission of papers that disprove or strengthen existing assumptions, deepen the understanding of existing problems, and validate known techniques in environments in which they were never before used or tested, with preference given to experimental results based on production data. Deployed-system papers will be treated similarly to other papers for publication purposes; they need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should offer useful guidance to practitioners.  
 A good deployed-systems paper:  
 clearly articulates lessons learned from deploying in production; 
  describes an operational system of broad interest; 
  discusses practical problems encountered in production; and 
  supports the lessons with appropriate evidence, potentially including statistical data from the actual deployment, empirical evaluation of the system (on production platforms rather than small testbeds), and anecdotes. 
  For deployed systems papers, the title should be prefixed with "Deployed System: "  , followed by the title. The prefix will not be published in the proceedings. Authors must also indicate that they are submitting a deployed-systems paper by checking the appropriate checkbox on the submission form. If a paper is both short and falls in the deployed systems category, both prefixes should be used (in any order), and both checkboxes selected.  
 Double-blind Policy for Deployed-system Paper:  All submissions for FAST '25 are required to follow the double-blind policy (see above). However, with deployed-system papers, the product or company described in the paper need not be anonymized (unlike author names).  
 Author Response Period  
 FAST '25 will allow authors to respond to reviews prior to final decision, according to the schedule above. Authors must limit their response to correcting factual errors in the reviews, to addressing questions posed by reviewers and to clarifying the ideas in the paper. Responses may include new experiments and data in response to a reviewer's request. Responses are optional and limited to 1000 words. FAST will be enforcing a hard limit on the length of the author's response for fairness and to reduce workload (for both authors and reviewers): exceeding the word limit will impact a paper negatively.  
 Conflict Identification  
 Upon submitting your paper, authors must indicate conflicts with PC members. A conflict exists in one of the following cases:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. A completed internship does not constitute an institutional conflict.  
 Advisor/Advisee:  Doctoral thesis advisor and post-doctoral advisor (if relevant) are conflicts for life.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years.  
 Close friends and family:  Close family relations (e.g., spouse, parent/child, sibling) and close friends are conflicts forever if they are potential reviewers.  
 The PC will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. If there is no basis for conflicts indicated by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Do not identify PC members as a conflict solely to avoid having them as reviewers. If you have any questions about conflicts, contact the program co-chairs.  
 Author Notification and Beyond  
 Authors will be notified of paper acceptance or rejection according to the schedule above. If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.  
 Early Rejection Notification.  This year, we will notify authors of papers that are rejected early in the process, prior to the author response period. The goal is to allow authors of early rejected papers to use reviewer feedback earlier and resubmit to another conference as soon as possible. Early rejected papers will no longer be considered under submission (regarding multiple submission policies) upon receipt of a rejection notification.  
 All papers will be available online to registered attendees no earlier than Friday, January 31, 2025. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the main conference, Tuesday, February 25, 2025. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX FAST '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .

 Conference dates | Tue-Fri, December 10-13, 2024 

 SUBMISSION DETAILS  
 Any paper submitted to EWSN 2024 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and not currently under review by any other conference or journal. All submissions in scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria.  
 The conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). All papers should present original research in the scope described above. No submission should have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles will be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” in the final proceedings. Note that EWSN 2024 intends to accept a small number of Short Papers to be presented together in a single dedicated session of the conference. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category as part of the review process.  
 EWSN 2024 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. To promote early dissemination, submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e.,  
 You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of the authors within the posted version. 
  You MAY NOT reference this arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN (this is one half of the cross-citation restriction). 
  You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in the arxiv paper (this is the other half of the cross-citation restriction). 
  You MAY reference the arxiv paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
  You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
  Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use "accepted, to appear" until the conference actually happens). 
  Submission will be via HotCRP: https://ewsn24.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.  
 Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers.  
  Should the program chairs deem this revision to be sufficient, the paper will be considered as a new submission for the summer cycle. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review.  
 Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the ACM templates for convenience (e.g., on Overleaf here  ).  
 All accepted conference and workshop papers, as well as poster, demo, PhD forum, and competition abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.  
 Generous cash awards sponsored by the Technology Innovation Institute  will be provided to the best paper, best paper runner-up, and the best presentation award.

 USENIX ATC '25:  2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference | July 7, 2025  – July 9, 2025   , Boston, MA, United States | Abstract registrations due: | January 7, 2025 - 3:59 pm | The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting. | We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. | Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. | Read More

 FASE 2025  
 28th International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering  
   
 General Information  
 FASE is concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built.  
   
 Submissions should make novel contributions to making software engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions should be supported by appropriate arguments and validation. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions to all such fundamental approaches, including:  
 applications of AI to software engineering, including search-based, learning-based approaches, and advances in code generation and program synthesis, automated testing and debugging, software documentation and program understanding intelligent code review and refactoring, DevOps and AIOps, and applications of large language models (LLMs). 
  software engineering foundations for AI-based systems, for example with focus on: explainability, transparency and trust, data management, testing and verification, lifecycle management, system architecture; 
  software quality and testing: validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties ( including security and data privacy) using techniques such as theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques; 
  software engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics; 
  ethical and responsible software engineering: prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI and software systems while addressing societal concerns like inequality and bias; 
  requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements, natural language processing for requirement elicitation; 
  software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture, e.g., SOA, microservice architectures cloud-native architectures, event-driven architectures, model-driven architectures, or software product lines; 
  specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, autonomous collaborative, intelligent, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, data-centric, service-oriented applications, multi-agent systems, safety-critical, real-time, blockchain-based, mixed-reality systems human-in-the-loop systems or digital twins; 
  model-driven engineering: model transformation, meta-modelling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages consistency and synchronization of models, generative architectures, low-code and no-code development; 
  software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development; 
  software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, mining software repositories. 

 Important Dates and Submissions  
 The important dates are available in the Joint Call for Papers  .  
   
 Selected papers from the FASE proceedings will be invited to submit an extended version to the Elsevier journal Science of Computer Programming (SCP)  . All publications in the special issue will be open access.  
 Detailed information on artifact evaluation  can be found here  .  

 Submission Categories  
   
 FASE 2025 solicits four types of submissions: research papers, empirical evaluation papers, new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers, tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers. Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface  .  
 Research papers  clearly identify and justify a principled advance to the fundamentals of software engineering. Research papers should clearly articulate their contribution, and provide sufficient evidence for the soundness and applicability of the proposed approach. Research papers are expected to be 15–18 pp (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 Empirical evaluation papers  evaluate existing software challenges or critically validate current proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in the software industry also falls into this category. We also encourage authors to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper, but should at least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs, and clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. Empirical evaluation papers are expected to be 15–18 pp (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) papers  seek to disrupt the status quo with forward-looking, thought-provoking innovative research on the foundations of software engineering, as well as lessons learned from the past. Our aim is to accelerate the exposure of the ETAPS community to early yet potentially ground-breaking research results, and to techniques and perspectives that challenge the status quo. To broadly capture this goal, the NIER track at FASE 2025 will publish the following types of papers:  
 Innovative or groundbreaking new ideas at early stages of research, supported by promising initial results and intuitions; 
  Visions of new directions: synergies with other fields or foundational approaches to problems that currently lack foundations in software engineering; 
  Lessons from the past: thoughtful observations on past or current research directions that may be somehow misguided or that let us see current research directions from a new perspective. 
  NIER papers are expected to be 6–8 pp (excluding bibliography). NIER papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality, relevance, and potential for impact on the field in terms of promoting innovative thinking. Hence inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea/vision/lesson must be described clearly. A full evaluation is not required for FASE NIER papers, but preliminary evaluation results may help the reviewers understand the scope of the work better.  
 Tool demonstration papers  and data showcase papers  present a new tool, a new tool component, novel extensions to an existing tool, or a new dataset. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture. Tool papers should give a clear account of the tool’s functionality and discuss the tool’s practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Experimental evaluation is not required for tools, however, a motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Dataset papers should describe the curation of datasets essential for software engineering research, replication studies, reporting of negative results, and insights gleaned from mining software repositories. Papers in this category are expected to be 6–8 pp (excluding bibliography). They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details on the actual demonstration.

The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

 Description  
 This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 18th International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science-Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (IJTCS-FAW 2024), consisting of the 18th International Conference on Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (FAW) and the 5th International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science (IJTCS), held in Hong Kong, SAR, China, during July 29-31, 2024.  
  FAW started as the Frontiers of Algorithmic Workshop in 2007 at Lanzhou, China, and was held annually from 2007 to 2021 and published archival proceedings. IJTCS, the International joint theoretical Computer Science Conference, started in 2020, aimed to bring in presentations covering active topics in selected tracks in theoretical computer science.  
  To accommodate the diversified new research directions in theoretical computer science, FAW and IJTCS joined their forces together to organize an event for information exchange of new findings and work of enduring value in the field.  
 The 20 full papers and 3 short papers included in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 43 submissions. They focused tracks on algorithms, blockchain theory, computational economics and algorithmic game theory.

 Satoshi Grace Period  
 On October 4th, 2024, we project that the Ethereum's Beacon Chain will publish a random number in slot 10100000  denoted "RANDAO Reveal". Based on the last (least significant) hex character of this number, we will offer a possible extension to the paper deadline as follows:  
  
 Number | Paper submission deadline 
 0, 1 | 8 October (original deadline) 
 2, 3, 4 | 9 October 
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 October 
 A, B, C, D, E, F | 11 October 
  
 The random number in slot 10100000 is 0x  8  f  b  c  7  9  e  b  7  3  3  d  3  f  e  f  8  d  2  1  8  a  0  9  2  4  b  d  a  4  a  0  f  f  6  7  6  3  1  7  7  9  0  d  c  5  8  c  2  7  8  a  4  6  2  f  7  d  9  c  0  3  a  e  d  1  6  1  8  b  e  4  9  d  f  1  f  d  7  7  e  4  4  f  0  c  8  e  f  2  6  0  e  0  e  a  1  4  c  7  b  d  a  6  7  0  d  0  2  6  2  c  c  4  7  3  a  6  a  8  7  b  6  7  e  b  2  1  d  c  e  f  9  3  e  7  5  d  d  2  9  d  9  8  f  1  c  3  8  7  2  4  3  2  e  9  d  e  5  8  e  2  b  2  0  f  6  0  2  7  9  5  b  a  a  5  5  1  c  0  8  2  c  e  a  4  3  5  d  5  2  e  and the FC25 submission deadline is thus 11 October 2024  .

 Click here to submit a paper   
 Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  , and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below.  
 General Information  
 For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form  when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.  
 Format  
 Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format ( templates  ) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.  
 Original Submissions  
 Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.  
 Ethics and Etiquette  
 Authors are required to read and follow this information  on ethics and etiquette.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair".  
 Evaluation Criteria  
 Regular Research Papers  
 Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices so the full papers should be intelligible without them.  
 Short Papers  
 Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text "Short Paper:". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text "SoK:".  
 Workshop Proposals  
 Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Workshop proposals should include:  
 Title 
  (Draft) Call for papers 
  Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope 
  (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s) 
  One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates 
  Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  . Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Tutorials  
 Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Tutorial proposals should include:  
 Title 
  Description 
  Name(s) of presenter(s) 
  Brief biographies for all presenters 
  Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s) 
  Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Rump Session  
 The conference will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.

 Overview The 23rd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '25) brings together researchers and practitioners to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of systems related to storage. The program committee interprets storage-related systems broadly: submissions on low-level storage devices, distributed storage systems, information and data management, as well as other systems interconnected with storage are all of interest. The conference will consist of technical presentations including refereed papers and poster sessions. Topics The topics of interest to FAST are various aspects of systems related to storage. These include and overlap with, but are not limited to, the following topics: Archival systems AI for storage and storage for AI Auditing and provenance Big data, analytics, and data sciences Caching, replication, and consistency Cloud, multi- and hybrid-cloud environments Data deduplication and compression Database storage Distributed and networked storage (wide-area, grid, peer-to-peer) Emerging memory hierarchy design Empirical evaluation Experience with deployed systems File system design Hardware design and prototypes HPC systems, including parallel I/O Key-value and NoSQL storage Management Memory-only storage systems Mobile, personal, embedded, and home storage Networking Novel and emerging storage technologies (e.g., DNA and glass storage) Performance and QoS Power-aware storage architectures RAID and erasure coding Reliability, availability, and disaster tolerance Search and data retrieval Security  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-05-26

 Satoshi Grace Period  
 On October 4th, 2024, we project that the Ethereum's Beacon Chain will publish a random number in slot 10100000  denoted "RANDAO Reveal". Based on the last (least significant) hex character of this number, we will offer a possible extension to the paper deadline as follows:  
  
 Number | Paper submission deadline 
 0, 1 | 8 October (original deadline) 
 2, 3, 4 | 9 October 
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 October 
 A, B, C, D, E, F | 11 October 
  
 The random number in slot 10100000 is 0x  8  f  b  c  7  9  e  b  7  3  3  d  3  f  e  f  8  d  2  1  8  a  0  9  2  4  b  d  a  4  a  0  f  f  6  7  6  3  1  7  7  9  0  d  c  5  8  c  2  7  8  a  4  6  2  f  7  d  9  c  0  3  a  e  d  1  6  1  8  b  e  4  9  d  f  1  f  d  7  7  e  4  4  f  0  c  8  e  f  2  6  0  e  0  e  a  1  4  c  7  b  d  a  6  7  0  d  0  2  6  2  c  c  4  7  3  a  6  a  8  7  b  6  7  e  b  2  1  d  c  e  f  9  3  e  7  5  d  d  2  9  d  9  8  f  1  c  3  8  7  2  4  3  2  e  9  d  e  5  8  e  2  b  2  0  f  6  0  2  7  9  5  b  a  a  5  5  1  c  0  8  2  c  e  a  4  3  5  d  5  2  e  and the FC25 submission deadline is thus 11 October 2024  .

 Submission  
 Contributions are sought in the following categories:  
   
 Research papers | , | regular papers (15 pages + references and appendices), 
  short papers (8 pages + references; no appendices), and 
  systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (20 pages + references and appendices) 
  Workshop proposals | (2 pages) 
  Tutorial proposals | (2 pages) 
   
 Research paper submissions must be uploaded through the conference submission website  .  
   
 Click here to submit a paper   
 Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  , and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below.  
 General Information  
 For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form  when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.  
 Format  
 Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format ( templates  ) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.  
 Original Submissions  
 Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.  
 Ethics and Etiquette  
 Authors are required to read and follow this information  on ethics and etiquette.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair".  
 Evaluation Criteria  
 Regular Research Papers  
 Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices so the full papers should be intelligible without them.  
 Short Papers  
 Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text "Short Paper:". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text "SoK:".  
 Workshop Proposals  
 Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Workshop proposals should include:  
 Title 
  (Draft) Call for papers 
  Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope 
  (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s) 
  One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates 
  Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  . Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Tutorials  
 Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Tutorial proposals should include:  
 Title 
  Description 
  Name(s) of presenter(s) 
  Brief biographies for all presenters 
  Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s) 
  Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Rump Session  
 The conference will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.

 Satoshi Grace Period  
 On October 4th, 2024, we project that the Ethereum's Beacon Chain will publish a random number in slot 10100000  denoted "RANDAO Reveal". Based on the last (least significant) hex character of this number, we will offer a possible extension to the paper deadline as follows:  
  
 Number | Paper submission deadline 
 0, 1 | 8 October (original deadline) 
 2, 3, 4 | 9 October 
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 October 
 A, B, C, D, E, F | 11 October 
  
 The random number in slot 10100000 is 0x  8  f  b  c  7  9  e  b  7  3  3  d  3  f  e  f  8  d  2  1  8  a  0  9  2  4  b  d  a  4  a  0  f  f  6  7  6  3  1  7  7  9  0  d  c  5  8  c  2  7  8  a  4  6  2  f  7  d  9  c  0  3  a  e  d  1  6  1  8  b  e  4  9  d  f  1  f  d  7  7  e  4  4  f  0  c  8  e  f  2  6  0  e  0  e  a  1  4  c  7  b  d  a  6  7  0  d  0  2  6  2  c  c  4  7  3  a  6  a  8  7  b  6  7  e  b  2  1  d  c  e  f  9  3  e  7  5  d  d  2  9  d  9  8  f  1  c  3  8  7  2  4  3  2  e  9  d  e  5  8  e  2  b  2  0  f  6  0  2  7  9  5  b  a  a  5  5  1  c  0  8  2  c  e  a  4  3  5  d  5  2  e  and the FC25 submission deadline is thus 11 October 2024  .

 Submission  
 Contributions are sought in the following categories:  
   
 Research papers | , | regular papers (15 pages + references and appendices), 
  short papers (8 pages + references; no appendices), and 
  systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (20 pages + references and appendices) 
  Workshop proposals | (2 pages) 
  Tutorial proposals | (2 pages) 
   
 Research paper submissions must be uploaded through the conference submission website  .  
   
 Click here to submit a paper   
 Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  , and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below.  
 General Information  
 For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form  when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.  
 Format  
 Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format ( templates  ) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.  
 Original Submissions  
 Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.  
 Ethics and Etiquette  
 Authors are required to read and follow this information  on ethics and etiquette.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair".  
 Evaluation Criteria  
 Regular Research Papers  
 Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices so the full papers should be intelligible without them.  
 Short Papers  
 Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text "Short Paper:". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text "SoK:".  
 Workshop Proposals  
 Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Workshop proposals should include:  
 Title 
  (Draft) Call for papers 
  Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope 
  (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s) 
  One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates 
  Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  . Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Tutorials  
 Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Tutorial proposals should include:  
 Title 
  Description 
  Name(s) of presenter(s) 
  Brief biographies for all presenters 
  Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s) 
  Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Rump Session  
 The conference will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.

 FASE  Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering  
 FASE is an established series of international conferences on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering with more than 30 years of tradition.   
   
 Conference Name and History  
 FASE has assumed its current name and format in 1998, when the ETAPS conferences have been created.  
   
 The first FASE was held in Lisbon, chaired by professor Egidio Astesiano at ETAPS 1998. However, FASE is older than ETAPS. The acronym FASE was first used in 1993 but with a different meaning than today. FASE builds on the traditions of Colloquim on Software Engineering  (CSE), of the Advanced Seminar on Foundations of Innovative Software Development  , and the Colloquium on Formal Approaches of Software Engineering  (FASE!) organized as part of the TAPSOFT brand until 1997. The European Association of Software Science and Technology (EASST) was the driving force behind creating and developing FASE.  

 Scope of Interest  
 FASE has a broad scope of interest.  
   
 As the field of the Software Engineering is broad, the scope of FASE is broad as well, including requirements, design architecture, modeling, refactoring, software transformation, generation and synthesis, test verification, validation, development methods and processes (agile), and so on. Thanks to its origins FASE has been traditionally focused primarily on formal models and methods, often involving reasoning about code, design, and the associated processes. However, these are not the only topics of interest. Agile methods, object-orientation search-based software engineering have been discussed in the past. Crucially, the letter “F” in FASE stands for “fundamental” not formal, and all research asking basic foundational questions about developing software is welcomed.  
 FASE is strongly affected by new developments in the technical landscape: AI and machine learning, security, block chain, quantum computing. FASE will continue to shift its interest along with the needs of the society and the interests of the research community. Wherever we go, we will continue asking what are the principles of developing systems in these areas, and what techniques help to reason about them, supporting new engineering methods and tools.  

 25 Anniversary Celebration  
 In 2022, FASE celebrated its 25 anniversary. Watch the talk of Gabriele Taentzer and Eduard Kamburjan about the conference history!

The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

   EasyChair Submission Link   
 The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. The use of pdflatex and the LNCS style is mandatory: papers that deviate significantly from the required format may be rejected without consideration of merit. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other conferences are allowed.   
 Without reviews from a sister conference or the (weak) majority of the reviews being negative, a paper cannot be submitted as a resubmission as shown below in *New in 2024* and should be submitted on or before April 8, 2024.   
 The paper may be excluded from the proceedings if none of the authors attends the conference.   
 The following tracks are open to submission this year:   
   
 Track A: The 18th Conference on Frontiers of Algorithmic Wisdom    
 Track B: Blockchain Theory and Technology    
    
 Track C: Computational Economics and Algorithmic Game Theory    
 The Best Paper Award will be presented to the author(s) of the best paper at IJTCS-FAW 2024. The Best Student Paper Award will be presented to the author(s) of the best paper whose authors are all full time students at IJTCS-FAW 2024.   
 New in 2024    
 This year, we introduce a special opportunity for authors whose submissions were previously rejected from sister conferences that sent out notification emails between January 1, 2024 and April 20, 2024 (such as EUROCRYPT 2024, ICALP 2024, IJCAI 2024, FUN 2024, SPAA 2024, WWW 2024, etc). This unique opportunity allows authors to resubmit their work to IJTCS-FAW with a later deadline (April 20, 2024) and a lighter review process. Authors are required to update their manuscripts, addressing the comments provided by previous reviewers, and adapt them to adhere to the style guidelines of IJTCS-FAW. All submitted material will undergo a check with the sister conference and will be reviewed by members of the IJTCS-FAW program committee.   
 Submission Requirements:    
 All resubmissions must be based on a rejected submission from a sister conference with notification between January 1, 2024 and April 20, 2024, and the (weak) majority of the review must be non-negative. 
  The submission is relevant to one of three submission tracks. 
  Authors must submit in one PDF document:    
 their original submission to the sister conference; 
  all review scores and reviews (including the meta-review) from the sister conference; 
  the IJTCS-FAW submission (that is, the revised submission), in the same format and with the same restrictions as were required for submissions to IJTCS-FAW; 
  an at most one-page long cover letter that describes how the IJTCS-FAW submission addresses the comments in the previous reviews, and a concise statement of why the submission is relevant for one of the three tracks A, B, and C of IJTCS-FAW. 
  Special Issue    
 After the conference, selected papers will be invited to special issues in: Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, Blockchain Journal, and Theory of Computing Systems.   
     Copyright    
 All the authors with accepted papers must sign and submit the copyright form.

 Submission  
 Contributions are sought in the following categories:  
   
 Research papers | , | regular papers (15 pages + references and appendices), 
  short papers (8 pages + references; no appendices), and 
  systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (20 pages + references and appendices) 
  Workshop proposals | (2 pages) 
  Tutorial proposals | (2 pages) 
   
 Research paper submissions must be uploaded through the conference submission website  .  
   
 Click here to submit a paper   
 Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  , and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below.  
 General Information  
 For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form  when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.  
 Format  
 Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format ( templates  ) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.  
 Original Submissions  
 Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.  
 Ethics and Etiquette  
 Authors are required to read and follow this information  on ethics and etiquette.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair".  
 Evaluation Criteria  
 Regular Research Papers  
 Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices so the full papers should be intelligible without them.  
 Short Papers  
 Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text "Short Paper:". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text "SoK:".  
 Workshop Proposals  
 Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Workshop proposals should include:  
 Title 
  (Draft) Call for papers 
  Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope 
  (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s) 
  One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates 
  Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  . Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Tutorials  
 Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.  
 Tutorial proposals should include:  
 Title 
  Description 
  Name(s) of presenter(s) 
  Brief biographies for all presenters 
  Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s) 
  Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc25workshops@ifca.ai  (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.  
 Rump Session  
 The conference will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.
