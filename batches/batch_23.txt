 Introduction 
 Ubiquitous sensors, devices, networks and information are paving the way towards a smart world in which computational intelligence is distributed throughout the physical environment to provide reliable and relevant services to people. This ubiquitous intelligence will change the computing landscape because it will enable new breeds of applications and systems to be developed and the realm of computing possibilities will be significantly extended. By enhancing everyday objects with intelligence many tasks and processes could be simplified, more efficient and more enjoyable. Ubiquitous computing is to create such intelligent/smart environments, services and applications.

 Abstract  
 Cognitive tools for uncovering useful abstractions  
 In the 17th century, the Cartesian coordinate system was groundbreaking. It exposed the unity between algebra and geometry, accelerating the development of the math that took humans to the moon. It was not just another concept, but a cognitive tool that people could wield to express abstract ideas in visual form, thereby expanding their capacity to think and generate new insights about a variety of other problems. Research in my lab aims to uncover the psychological mechanisms that explain how people have come to deploy these technologies in such innovative ways to learn, share knowledge, and create new things. In the first part of this talk, I will provide an overview of our recent work investigating drawing — one of our most enduring and versatile tools. Across several empirical and computational studies, I’ll argue that drawing not only provides a window into how we perceive and understand the visual world, but also accelerates humans’ ability to learn and communicate useful abstractions. In the second part, I will describe an emerging line of work investigating how humans discover new abstractions when building physical structures, and externalize these abstractions to support planning and collaboration. I will close by noting the broader implications of embracing such complex, naturalistic behaviors for advancing theories of human cognition and enhancing real-world impact, including in AI and education.

 Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2023  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format  , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2- column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.  
 Revised Papers from Prior Submission:  To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2023 paper submission process.  
 Submission Information  
 Submission Platform   
 All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS 2.0 by the abstract and paper deadline | . 
  In PCS 2.0, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2023” and “UIST 2023 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” 
    
 Submission Format and Length   
 We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, please consider papers in the range of ~7,500-10,000 words. 
    
 Accompanying Video   
 Optional, but highly encouraged 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec

  Subtitles are required (3-day grace period) using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Maximum File Size   
 Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB 
    
 Anonymity   
 Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) | [anonymity policy] 
    
 Selection Process   
 Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers 
    
 Publication   
 Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Final Publication Format   
 As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library. 
  For | LaTeX authors | , your source files will be used to auto-generate 1) a double-column PDF ( | example PDF | ), and 2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) that will be placed in the Digital Library. 
  For | Word authors | , you will need to submit your paper in | single-column format | to correctly auto-generate 1) a double-column PDF ( | example PDF | ), and 2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) in the Digital Library. 
    
 Presentation Format   
 Talk at the conference by one or more authors of the paper 
  Update: Due to a large increase in the number of submissions, we have less time for each submission than initially communicated. All papers will have 8 minutes for presentation, followed by 4 minutes for Q&A. An assigned session chair will help moderate. 
    
 Video Preview   
 Video previews are mandatory. 
  Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec

  We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under | Making Video Figures Accessible | . 
    
 Demo   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST | demo session | . 

 Additional Notes  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format | , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2- column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template. 
  We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
  We will also use a two-week rebuttal period for papers (Thursday, May 25 to Thursday, June 8, 2023). Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Papers Co-chairs as much as possible. 
  The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. The video is due on Friday, April 7, 2023. 
  Accessibility is a key concern for the UIST 2023 Program Chairs | . We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible and will allow 6 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. These additional materials are due on Tuesday, April 11, 2023. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2023 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | accessibility2023@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the April 11, 2023 deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.

  Demos  
 Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR and large interactive installations.  
 All demo submissions go through a rigorous curation process. The demo chairs will announce recommendations for presentation formats, logistics and provide early access for technical setup before the conference.

 Demo Abstract 
  We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
   
  Floor Plan 
  The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
  This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. 
   
  Demo Video 
  This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work 
  It shows the working demo in appropriate detail 
  It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website

 Selection Process   
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
  Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
    
 Publication   
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
  Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
    
 Lab Demos   
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
    
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission   
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track 
    
 Novelty of Work   
 Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed 
    
 Demos of Accepted UIST 2023 Papers   
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo have to  submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | (1) Regular demo submission  : authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors. | (2) Fast track  : Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). 
    
 Changes in author list and affiliations   
 Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS 
  It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission 
  It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission

  Workshops  
 Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping, in combination with talks and keynotes. Workshops activities should target an audience of approximately 20 participants. All workshop participants will be required to register for the main conference, and there will be an additional fee to attend workshops to cover the additional logistical expenses.  
 Given space limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop. Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other. These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be more lightly reviewed than papers by an external jury.

  Visions  
 Back for its sixth year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI. The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are. The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate issues might be: future trends, foundational technologies that we need to make progress on, significant, compelling problems that the community might address, something that is missing, or an alternative perspective on what we do.

  Doctoral Symposium  
 The UIST Doctoral Symposium provides a unique opportunity for Ph.D. students to interact with established academic and industry researchers in the UIST community. Students can receive both feedback on technical aspects of their research as well as mentoring about different career options.

 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is requested to present their demo during SIC sessions and to speak with conference attendees. 

 The UIST SIC is your opportunity to shine and impress the world with your creative ideas! Participants will demo their work during the conference program, and contest winners will be announced during the conference. A jury composed of senior UIST community members will select one team to receive the SIC jury award. On top of that, conference attendees will get a chance to vote for their favorite teams in the People’s Choice category. Each selected team will have access to LLM API usage, which is made possible through our generous sponsor Anthropic AI.  
 UIST 2023 SIC Challenge: Beyond Words  
   
 Your goal is to design and implement a novel interactive system, utilizing the LLM API provided to you. This system should leverage LLMs, and you may incorporate any other prototyping resources available. This year, we encourage participants to be innovative and think outside the box when integrating LLMs into interactive systems. Specifically, we encourage teams to explore novel use cases or applications of LLMs, such as those that incorporate different input/output modalities—exploring how LLMs can interact with audio, images, videos, etc., and broadening design possibilities.  
 To successfully address this challenge, you need to figure out what task(s) you want your system to support, and what interaction(s) you want your system to enable. Your system should motivate the use case and articulate a clear set of assumptions on how it will benefit users. Finally, your system does not have to be limited to one user— ideas that involve well-executed, multi-user, simultaneous interactions are often crowd favorites at UIST! We favor radical ideas that showcase fresh angles and novel uses of LLMs in interactive systems. We also encourage you to think about how you can connect LLMs to your own research. You will submit a video of your project demo by October 25th, and demonstrate your idea live at the in-person UIST event on October 29th - November 1st. Your video will be uploaded and shared on the official ACM SIGCHI YouTube channel (e.g., see UIST 2022 SIC videos  ).  
 Anthropic Claude API  
   
 This year, we’ll provide selected teams with access to the Anthropic Console. The Anthropic’s console provides access to LLM models with unique features.  
 One of the strongest LLM models: strong performance in code understanding/generation and quantitative reasoning (e.g., solving math problems) and scores well in exams such as the GRE and Bar 
  Long context support of up to 100,000 tokens - useful for processing very long documents (e.g., hundreds of pages, books) 
  Claude API includes Instant versions of the model designed for very fast responses 
  Logging into the Anthropic console provides access to the web-based chat GUI which allows for fast and easy experimentation. The console also allows for the creation of API keys for integration into external systems and applications. API keys support unlimited queries but may be subject to a rate limit. Use of the Anthropic must adhere to the Acceptable Use Policy ( https://console.anthropic.com/legal  ).  
 The API can be queried with standard REST requests, and documentation and API reference are available online ( https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs  ). Anthropic provides example code for Python and Typescript ( https://github.com/anthropics  ) and example applications to illustrate API usage.  
 We highly suggest incorporating any other software or hardware available at your disposal, to make more innovative and compelling projects:  
 Any additional APIs you want to integrate (object detection, OCR, speech recognition) 
  Any additional devices you want to use (gesture control, camera, robotic arm). 
  If you consider integrating various I/O modalities with LLMs, you can use tools to transform these modalities into text or generate them based on texts. For instance, you could employ image captioning and object recognition to convert images or videos into text that LLMs can understand. Additionally, there are a growing number of open-sourced AI models that combine various modalities, which you can consider using in your system. For example, the BLIP-2  and LLaVA  models for image-to-text processing; CLIP  and CLAP  for joint embedding spaces of text-image and text-audio, respectively.  
 To assist the students in developing their applications, we (the SIC chairs) will provide technical support if they have any questions.  
 Application Areas and Design Space  
 You can build and design your system in many configurations, which affords the exploration of numerous design primitives. The primary requirements are to utilize the provided Claude API and to ensure that users can interact with the system in a meaningful way. With these requirements in mind, you may focus on one or more application areas. Below, we have listed some example application areas and corresponding existing works for inspiration.  
   
 (From top-left: SayCan, TaleBrush, LLM4UI, Generative Agents, Opal, Visual Captions)  
 LLM + Robotics (E.g. | SayCan | , | Stargazer | ) 
  LLM + Visual Generation (E.g. | Opal | , | Promptify | , | 3DALL-E | ) 
  LLM + Agent/Gaming (E.g. | Generative Agents | ) 
  LLM + Direct Manipulation (E.g. | TaleBrush | ) 
  LLM + Visual Communication (E.g. | Visual Captions | ) 
  LLM + UI/Code (E.g., | LLM4UI | , | Stylette | , | PromptInfuser | ) 
  LLM + Audio/Music/Podcast (E.g. | Podly.ai | ) 
  LLM + Learning/Education (E.g. | Khanmingo | ) 
  Novel Interface for LLM (E.g. | Graphologue | , | Sensecape | ) 
  LLM + Sensor/Activity Detection 
  LLM + Accessibility 
  LLM + Fabrication 
  Many Others! 
  Logistics  
 Team members from selected proposals will be given an Anthropic account that allows access to a chat interface and API keys, which can be integrated into custom applications. Anthropic’s website and GitHub repositories contain documentation and example code that could be useful for development. Teams are encouraged to open source their efforts, and even build on each other’s work. To get you moving fast, we will also provide a list of tutorials and mentoring sessions to ensure you have everything you need to make your vision a reality!  
 Ethics and Broader Impact Statement  
 In our commitment to responsible innovation, all proposals must include an Ethics and Broader Impact statement. Authors submitting proposals must follow the NeurIPS Ethics Guidelines  . In particular, “whenever there are risks associated with the proposed methods, methodology, application or data collection and data usage, authors are expected to elaborate on the rationale of their decision and potential mitigations.” We ask the authors to reflect on the potential ethical dimensions of their project at its inception. This statement should be a concise exploration of potential ethical concerns, biases, and societal implications that the project could raise. Additionally, authors should describe how they plan to mitigate any potential negative outcomes. For detailed writing guide, please read A Guide to Writing the NeurIPS Impact Statement  . Should you have an questions, please reach out to the SIC co-chairs at sic2023@uist.org  .

 PCS Submissions     
 Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2024  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format  , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.  
 Your submission must be original  . UIST only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to UIST 2024 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to the author guide   for details. Additionally, authors should avoid generated context by AI-agents (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar).  
 Revised Papers from Prior Submissions:  To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2024 paper submission process.  
 Submission Information  
 Submission Platform   
 All required materials must be | submitted electronically to PCS | by the abstract and paper deadline. 
  In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2024” and “UIST 2024 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline.

 Additional Notes  
 We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
  Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible. 
  The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2024 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | accessibility2024@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.

  Posters  
 Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress, and work that is already presented in other venues but to share more with the UIST community. Posters are non-archival and will be more lightly reviewed (curated) than papers.  
 For questions, please email the poster chairs at posters2024@uist.org  .

  Demos  
 Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos — from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR and large interactive installations. All demo submissions go through a rigorous curation process. The demo chairs will announce recommendations for presentation formats, logistics and provide early access for technical setup before the conference.  
 For questions, please email the demo chairs at demos2024@uist.org  .

 Submission Format and Length   
 Demo Abstract 
  We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
  For | LaTeX authors | , submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} | . 
  For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | submission template | , | example PDF | ). 
  We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
   
  Floor Plan 
  The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
  This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. 
   
  Demo Video 
  Optional, but strongly encouraged for regular demo submissions. 
  This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work 
  It shows the working demo in appropriate detail 
  It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website 
  Length: up to 5 min 
  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Preview Video

  Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
  Size: < 150 MB 
  Length: 30 seconds 
  Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
    
 Anonymity   
 Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process. 
    
 Selection Process   
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
  Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
    
 Publication   
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
  Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
    
 Lab Demos   
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
    
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission   
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track 
    
 Novelty of Work   
 Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed 
    
 Demos of Accepted UIST 2024 Papers   
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo have to  submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | (1) Regular demo submission  : authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors. Since demo publications are non-archival, authors are welcome to adapt content from their full UIST paper or other prior publication. We encourage authors to use a distinct title from the full paper (e.g., “Demonstration of …”) to avoid confusion in citations and search results. | (2) Fast track  : Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). We intend to accept as many fast track demos as logistics and space allows. 
    
 Changes in author list and affiliations   
 Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS 
  It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission 
  It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission

  Workshops  
 Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping. Workshops activities should target the active participation of approximately 20-60 participants. Workshop participants will not   be required to register for the main conference; there will be a fee to attend workshops.  
 Given space and activity limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop.  
 Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other. We encourage not just typical UIST topics of interest but also intersections between UIST and other communities within and beyond HCI. These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be selected by the organizers based on topic fit, quality of anticipated interaction, and anticipated interest.  
 For questions, please email the workshop chairs at workshops2024@uist.org  .

  Visions  
 Back for its seventh year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI.  
 The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are.  
 The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate topics might be:  
 future trends 
  foundational technologies that we need to make progress on 
  significant, compelling problems that the community might address 
  topics that are absent from the community’s work 
  an alternative perspective on what we do

 PCS Submissions     
 Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2024  
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format  , but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.  
 Your submission must be original  . UIST only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to UIST 2024 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to the author guide   for details. Additionally, authors should avoid generated context by AI-agents (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar).  
 Revised Papers from Prior Submissions:  To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2024 paper submission process.  
 Submission Information  
 Submission Platform   
 All required materials must be | submitted electronically to PCS | by the abstract and paper deadline. 
  In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2024” and “UIST 2024 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline. 
    
 Submission Format and Length

 Additional Notes  
 We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
  Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible. 
  The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2024 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | accessibility2024@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.

 Anonymity   
 Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process. 
    
 Selection Process   
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
  Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
    
 Publication   
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
  Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
    
 Presentation Format   
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
    
 Lab Demos   
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
    
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission   
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track 
    
 Novelty of Work   
 Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed 
    
 Demos of Accepted UIST 2024 Papers   
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo have to  submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | (1) Regular demo submission  : authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors. Since demo publications are non-archival, authors are welcome to adapt content from their full UIST paper or other prior publication. We encourage authors to use a distinct title from the full paper (e.g., “Demonstration of …”) to avoid confusion in citations and search results. | (2) Fast track  : Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). We intend to accept as many fast track demos as logistics and space allows. 
    
 Changes in author list and affiliations   
 Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS 
  It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission 
  It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission

  Workshops  
 Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping. Workshops activities should target the active participation of approximately 20-60 participants. Workshop participants will not   be required to register for the main conference; there will be a fee to attend workshops.  
 Given space and activity limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop.  
 Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other. We encourage not just typical UIST topics of interest but also intersections between UIST and other communities within and beyond HCI. These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be selected by the organizers based on topic fit, quality of anticipated interaction, and anticipated interest.  
 For questions, please email the workshop chairs at workshops2024@uist.org  .

  Visions  
 Back for its seventh year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI.  
 The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are.  
 The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate topics might be:  
 future trends 
  foundational technologies that we need to make progress on 
  significant, compelling problems that the community might address 
  topics that are absent from the community’s work 
  an alternative perspective on what we do

 Our goal is to make sure SVs can attend the sessions that they are interested in. In 2024, we expect to have around 35 SVs who will work approximately 15 hours before or during the conference.  
 SVs will do a mix of tasks before and during the conference. Any hours spent doing pre-conference tasks will count towards your total SV hours. Some pre-conference tasks may need to be done several weeks before the conference begins; please indicate your availability to do pre-conference tasks on the lottery questionnaire and we will try to accommodate everyone’s preferences as best as possible.  
 UIST 2024 is intended to be a fully in-person conference (see Attending  ). Most SV tasks will be in person and we expect all SVs to attend the conference in person.  
 Thanks so much for applying! We look forward to seeing you at UIST 2024!!

 Research Interests  
 What are the challenges in creating interfaces that allow a user to intuitively act and express his/her intentions? Today's Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems include virtual / augmented reality are limited, and exploit only visual and auditory sensations. However, in daily life, we exploit a variety of input and output modalities, and modalities that involve contact with our bodies can dramatically affect our ability to experience and express ourselves in physical and virtual worlds. Using modern physiological understandings of sensation and perception, emerging electronic devices, and agile computational methods, we now have an opportunity to design a new generation of "Human-Computer Integrated" systems.  
 We have archived several improvements that use multi/cross modal interfaces for enhancing human I/O. They include Transparent Cockpit, Stop-Motion Goggle, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation, JINS MEME (electrooculography (EOG)-based smart glasses) and Superhuman Sports.  
 Our challenges include:  
  (1) Understanding human factors  
  (2) Enhancing human I/O  
  (3) Designing new body schema  
  (4) Experience engineering and entertainment computing

 Call for Papers: Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025  
 The call for papers is now open.  

 The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy. USEC ’25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas. We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields.  
 To honor significant contributions that have had a lasting impact on the field, USEC ’25 will also feature a Test of Time Award  . This award will celebrate research demonstrating enduring relevance and influence in usable security and privacy over the past 14 years of USEC. We will invite nominations for this award from the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and authors submitting their works to USEC ’25. This recognition will honor research that continues to shape and inspire current and future investigations in the discipline.  

 Submission Guidelines for Papers  
 All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. All papers should be written in English. We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use the templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events  .  
 Research Track:  The research track is intended to report on mature work that has been completed. The goal of the USEC’s research track is to disseminate results of interest to the broader usable security and privacy community. Papers must not be more than 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Try to scale the length of the paper according to the contributions you describe therein. Authors have the option to attach to their paper‘s supplementary appendices with study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Meta-Science Track:  The Meta-Science Track is intended to report on mature work and seeks to disseminate results that contribute to the broader understanding and improvement of research practices, including the replicability of studies and the systematization of existing knowledge. Submissions in this track may include comprehensive evaluations of research methodologies, studies that replicate and verify prior findings, meta-analyses that synthesize existing literature, and SoK papers that systematically organize and analyze research in a specific domain. Papers must not exceed 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Vision Track:  The vision track is intended to report on work in progress or concrete ideas for work that has yet to begin. The focus of the vision track is to spark discussion with the goal of providing the authors helpful feedback, pointers to potentially related investigations, and new ideas to explore. Suitable submissions to the vision track include traditional work-in-progress pieces such as preliminary results of pre-studies but also research proposals and position papers outlining future research. Papers must be up to 5 pages in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.  
 The submission portal for papers: https://usec25.hotcrp.com/    
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Areas of Interest  
 Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
  New applications of existing models or technology 
  Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned 
  Security testing of new or existing usability features 
  Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy 
  Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research 
    
 Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments 
  Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience 
  Systematization of Knowledge 
  Inclusive security and privacy 
  Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research 
  Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems 
  Usability in smart manufacturing 

 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline: | 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, | Anywhere-on-earth (AOE) 
  Reviews Due: 16 December 2024 
  Discussion Period: 16-19 December 2024 
  Notification of Acceptance: 20 December 2024 
  Camera Ready Deadline: 28 January 2025 
  Workshop Date: 24 February 2025 
  Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.

We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields.  
 To honor significant contributions that have had a lasting impact on the field, USEC ’25 will also feature a Test of Time Award  . This award will celebrate research demonstrating enduring relevance and influence in usable security and privacy over the past 14 years of USEC. We will invite nominations for this award from the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and authors submitting their works to USEC ’25. This recognition will honor research that continues to shape and inspire current and future investigations in the discipline.  

 Submission Guidelines for Papers  
 All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. All papers should be written in English. We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use the templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events  .  
 Research Track:  The research track is intended to report on mature work that has been completed. The goal of the USEC’s research track is to disseminate results of interest to the broader usable security and privacy community. Papers must not be more than 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Try to scale the length of the paper according to the contributions you describe therein. Authors have the option to attach to their paper‘s supplementary appendices with study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Meta-Science Track:  The Meta-Science Track is intended to report on mature work and seeks to disseminate results that contribute to the broader understanding and improvement of research practices, including the replicability of studies and the systematization of existing knowledge. Submissions in this track may include comprehensive evaluations of research methodologies, studies that replicate and verify prior findings, meta-analyses that synthesize existing literature, and SoK papers that systematically organize and analyze research in a specific domain. Papers must not exceed 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them.  
 Vision Track:  The vision track is intended to report on work in progress or concrete ideas for work that has yet to begin. The focus of the vision track is to spark discussion with the goal of providing the authors helpful feedback, pointers to potentially related investigations, and new ideas to explore. Suitable submissions to the vision track include traditional work-in-progress pieces such as preliminary results of pre-studies but also research proposals and position papers outlining future research. Papers must be up to 5 pages in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.  
 The submission portal for papers: https://usec25.hotcrp.com/    
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Areas of Interest  
 Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
  New applications of existing models or technology 
  Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned 
  Security testing of new or existing usability features 
  Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy 
  Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research 
    
 Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments 
  Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience 
  Systematization of Knowledge 
  Inclusive security and privacy 
  Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research 
  Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems 
  Usability in smart manufacturing 

 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission Deadline: | 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, | Anywhere-on-earth (AOE) 
  Reviews Due: 16 December 2024 
  Discussion Period: 16-19 December 2024 
  Notification of Acceptance: 20 December 2024 
  Camera Ready Deadline: 28 January 2025 
  Workshop Date: 24 February 2025 
  Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.

 Submission Guidelines  

 All submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system, https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025  , by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.  

 Format.  We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM two-column format:  
 Long papers | ( | 8 pages | at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value. They should reflect more complex innovations or studies and should have a more thorough discussion of related work. Each accepted long paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented in a plenary session as part of the main conference program. 
  Short papers | ( | 4 pages | at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper – they are not “work-in-progress” reports but rather complete reports on a smaller or simpler-to-describe but complete research work on advances that can be described, set into context, and evaluated concisely. In particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance to this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental validation or lacking a strong theoretical foundation. Each accepted short paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented either as an oral presentation or at a poster session as part of the main conference program. 
  We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.  

 Anonymity.  Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection. It is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization.  

 Templates.  Following the ACM Publication Workflow  , all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format  . Instructions for authors are given below:  
 LaTeX: | Please use the latest version of the | Primary Article Template | – LaTeX to create your submission. Start the document with the \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} command to generate the output in a double-column format. Please see the | LaTeX documentation | and | ACM’s LaTeX best practices guide | for further instructions, ignoring the single-column instructions. Do not use the “manuscript” option, otherwise, the document will not be compiled in double-column, as required. Check the sample-sigconf.tex file included in the template package for a formatting example. To ensure 100% compatibility with The ACM Publishing System (TAPS), please restrict the use of packages to the | whitelist of approved LaTeX packages | . 
  Overleaf: | (use \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | preparing your article with Overleaf | . 
  Word: | Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | preparing your article with Microsoft Word 

 Accessibility.  Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. The descriptive text will be displayed in place of a float if the float cannot be loaded. This benefits the author and it broadens the reader base for the author’s work. Moreover, the alt text provides in-depth float descriptions to search engine crawlers, which helps to properly index these floats. Additionally, authors should follow the ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures  .  

 Submission Policy.  All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy  , which is why submitted manuscripts should not be currently under review at another publication venue. Particularly, please consider the following ACM’s publication policies:  
 “By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all | ACM Publications Policies | , including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.” | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects 
  “Please ensure that you and your co-authors | obtain an ORCID ID | , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a | commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors | . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.” 

 Review Process  

 Review.  ACM UMAP uses a double-blind  review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.  

 Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field. Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on whether the length is appropriate for the contribution. In addition, ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation  , offering a small window for authors to optionally discuss the initial decision of their submission, enhancing the transparency and quality of the reviewing process.  

 The ACM Code of Ethics  gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Furthermore, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection.  

 Registration and Presentation Policy  

 Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration  , completed by the early registration date cut-off  . Each accepted paper must be presented in person  to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM  , and available via the ACM Digital Library  . The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of UMAP 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

 Camera-ready Submission  

 Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting  . Users of the Word template must use either the version for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats, such as Open Office, etc., are not admitted) for the camera-ready submission to avoid incompatibility issues.  

 Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided after acceptance. This might include instructions to prepare a video of the accepted contribution. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be later submitted using ACM’s new production platform  , where authors will be able to review PDF and HTML output formats before publication.  

 Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations  

 ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.

 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025)  
 July 14–19, 2025  
 Washington, DC and Online  
   
 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

  PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.  
 Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):  
 Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts) 
  Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data) 
  Scripts for data processing or simulations 
  Machine-generated proofs 
  Formal specifications 
  Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts) 
   
 Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of utility, and feedback is given to the authors. Issues considered include software bugs, readability of documentation and appropriate licensing. After your artifact has been approved by the committee, we will accompany the paper link on petsymposium.org  with a link to the artifact along with an artifact badge so that interested readers can find and use your artifact.  
 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies    
  You are invited to submit nominations for the 2025 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies. The Caspar Bowden PET award is presented annually to researchers who have made an outstanding contribution to the theory, design implementation, or deployment of privacy enhancing technologies. It is awarded at PETS and carries a cash prize as well as a physical award statue. Any paper by any author written in the area of privacy enhancing technologies is eligible for nomination. However, the paper must have appeared in a refereed journal conference, or workshop with proceedings published in the period from April 1 2023 until March 30, 2025.  
 Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award   
  A winner of the Andreas Pfitzmann PETS 2025 Best Student Paper Award will be selected at PETS 2025. Papers written solely or primarily by a student who is presenting the work to PETS 2025 are eligible for the award.  
 Artifact Award   
  A winner of the PETS 2025 Artifact Award will be announced at PETS 2025. Artifacts for papers accepted to PETS 2025 are eligible for the award.  
 HotPETs and FOCI   
  As with the last several years, part of the symposium will be devoted to HotPETs — the "hottest," most exciting research ideas still in a still in a formative state — and FOCI, a workshop showcasing the latest results from the Free and Open Communication on the Internet community. Further information will be published on the PETS website in early 2025.

 Overview  
 The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting.  
 We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.  
 Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.  
 There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers.  
 Submission Type: Full vs. Short  
 USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper. For further details, see the submission instructions  .  
 Deployed Systems Track  
 USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track.  
 Early Rejection Notifications  
 USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent.  
 Authors' Response Period  
 USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above.  
 Confidentiality  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 On the Use of Generative AI  
 While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers including sections generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org  .  
 Questions?  
 Please direct any questions to the program co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org  or to the USENIX office at submissionspolicy@usenix.org  .

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

 USENIX Security '25 Submission Policies and Instructions  

 USENIX Security '25 submissions deadlines are as follows:  
 Cycle 1 Deadline: | Wednesday, September 4, 2024, 11:59 pm AoE 
  Cycle 2 Deadline: | Wednesday, January 22, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE 
  All papers that are accepted by the end of the second submission cycle (January–June 2025) will appear in the proceedings for USENIX Security '25. All submissions should be made online via their respective submission systems: Cycle 1  and Cycle 2 (available soon) . We do not accept email submissions.  
 Submitted papers should describe original, scientifically sound work produced by the co-authors. All submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Submissions should be finished, complete papers. We may desk-reject papers that have severe editorial problems (broken references, egregious spelling or grammar errors, missing figures, etc.), are submitted in violation of the Submission Instructions outlined below, are outside of the scope of the symposium, or are deemed clearly of insufficient quality to appear in the program.  
 Summary of main changes from previous editions   
   
 Ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy must be discussed in the paper. An extra page is provided just for these topics. Artifacts are expected to be available by the camera-ready deadline. 
   
 Paper Format  
 Submissions must be in PDF format. Please make sure your submission can be opened using Adobe Reader. Please make sure your submission, and all embedded figures, are intelligible when printed in grayscale.  
 Submissions should be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two-column format in 10-point Times Roman type on 12-point leading (single-spaced), in a text block 7" x 9" deep. Authors must use USENIX's templates and style files  when preparing the paper for submission. Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection.  
 Initial paper submissions (i.e., all papers except those that have been revised after receiving an "Invited for Major Revision" decision at USENIX Security '25 or "Accept Conditional on Major Revision" at USENIX Security '24) should consist of at most 13 typeset pages for the main body of the paper, one additional page for discussing ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy, and a bibliography and well-marked appendices. At submission time, there is no limit on the length of the bibliography and appendices but reviewers are not required to read any appendices. These appendices may be included to assist reviewers who may have questions that fall outside the stated contribution of the paper on which your work is to be evaluated, or to provide details that would only be of interest to a small minority of readers. The paper should be self-contained without appendices.  
 To accommodate additional material requested by reviewers, the revisions for papers that previously received an "Accept Conditional on Major Revision" decision can use up to 14 typeset pages for the main body of the paper, excluding the one page for discussing ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy, the bibliography, and well-marked appendices.  
 Once accepted, the final version should be no longer than 20 pages, including the bibliography and any appendices.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 The review process will be anonymous. Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review:  
 The title page should not contain any author names or affiliations. 
  Authors should carefully review figures and appendices (especially survey instruments) to ensure affiliations are not accidentally included. 
  When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Anonymous references are only allowed in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible, and after approval of the chairs. 
  Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. Neither the link in the paper nor the website itself should suggest the authors' identities (e.g., the website should not contain the authors' names or affiliations). 
  Authors should carefully check any submitted prior reviews for identifying details. 
  Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc., during the review process.  
 Simultaneous Submission and Plagiarism  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. Authors should relate their submission to any other relevant submissions of theirs in other venues that are under review at the same time as their submission to the Symposium. These citations to simultaneously submitted papers should be anonymized; non-anonymous versions of these citations must, however, be emailed to the program co-chairs at sec25chairs@usenix.org  . Failure to point out and explain overlap with published or simultaneously submitted papers will be grounds for rejection. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy  for details.  
 Papers that have received a decision of "Invited for Major Revision" from USENIX Security are still considered to be under review until accepted or rejected by the reviewers; authors must formally withdraw their paper if they wish to submit to another venue. See USENIX Security '25 Reviewing Model  for details. Submissions that were rejected from the last cycle of USENIX Security '24 may not be resubmitted until the second cycle of USENIX Security '25.  
 All submitted papers are considered to be under review for USENIX Security '25 until authors are notified of a decision by the program committee or the program co-chairs approve a request for withdrawal.  
 Ethics  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of all  submissions. All submissions are hence required to have an ethics considerations section in the main body of the paper, or in the extra page offered for "ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy" (see the Paper Format section above), or both. In some cases, the ethics discussion may be short; in other cases, the ethics consideration may be long. Regardless of length, from reading the main body of the paper and the extra "ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy" page, it should be clear to reviewers that the authors made sound and responsible ethical decisions.  
 Authors should be prepared to answer these questions in the conference submission portal:  
 "I attest that I read the ethics considerations discussions in the conference call for papers, the detailed submissions instructions, and the guidelines for ethics document." 
  "I attest that the research team considered the ethics of this research, that the authors believe the research was done ethically, and that the team's next-step plans (e.g., after publication) are ethical." 
  "I attest that the submission has a clearly-marked section on ethical considerations in the body of the paper and/or in the extra 'ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy' page." 
  In addition to reading this page, authors are expected to read the Call for Papers  and the Ethics Guidelines  .  
   
 Open Science Policy  
 Non-compliance with the new open science policy can lead to severe repercussions, including the rejection of the non-compliant paper or, in the case of egregious violations such as not following through with promised artifact sharing, barring the authors from submitting to future conference cycles.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to and rejected from a conference (including USENIX Security), authors may, but are not required to, submit a separate PDF document containing the prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 Reviewers will submit their initial reviews prior to becoming aware of previous reviews and summaries of changes to avoid being biased in formulating their own opinions; once their initial reviews are submitted, however, reviewers will be given the opportunity to update their thoughts based on the submission history of the paper.  
 Rules for Revisions  
 For submissions that received "Invited for Major Revision" decisions during one of the USENIX Security '25 submission periods, authors who revise their papers must submit a separate PDF document that includes the verbatim revision criteria, a list of changes made to the paper, an explanation of how the changes address the criteria, and a copy of the revised paper in which the changes from the original version are highlighted. Ideally, the highlighted version of the paper would be produced by latexdiff or a similar tool. However, if papers have gone through major changes that would make such a document unreadable, authors are free to provide another format that helps the shepherd to identify changes efficiently.  
 Papers that have received a decision of "Invited for Major Revision" from USENIX Security are still considered to be under review until accepted or rejected by the reviewers; authors must formally withdraw their paper if they wish to submit to another venue.  
 For resubmissions of "Major Revisions" from USENIX Security '24, please look at USENIX Security '24 Submission Policies and Instructions  for requirements. Authors are encouraged but not required to adhere to the USENIX Security '25 guidelines for discussing ethics considerations and compliance with open science guidelines.  
 Embargo Requests  
 Authors may request an embargo for their papers by the deadline dates listed below. All embargoed papers will be released on the first day of the conference, Wednesday, August 13, 2025.  
 Cycle 1 deadline for embargo requests: | Thursday, February 27, 2025 
  Cycle 2 deadline for embargo requests: | Thursday, July 10, 2025 
  If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  after you submit your final paper.  
  Conflicts of Interest  
 The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest. This includes: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including secondary affiliations and consulting work), (2) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past, (3) anyone the author has collaborated or published with in the prior two years, (4) anyone who is affiliated with a party that funds your research, or (5) close personal relationships. For other forms of conflict, authors must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. In addition to selecting program committee conflicts when submitting, we recommend that all authors ensure they have up-to-date HotCRP profiles listing all known conflicts.  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from the evaluation and discussion of the paper.  
 Final versions of accepted submissions should include all sources of funding in an acknowledgments section. Authors should also disclose any affiliations, interests, or other facts that might be relevant to readers seeking to interpret the work and its implications. Authors may wish to consider the 2023 IEEE S&P Financial Conflicts Policy  for example.  
 To prevent retroactive conflicts of interest, all authors must be declared at submission time.  
 Confidentiality of Submissions  
 The program committee and external reviewers are required to treat all submissions as confidential. However, the program co-chairs or designated committee members may share submissions outside the program committee to allow chairs of other conferences to identify dual submissions.  
 Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.  
 Reasons for Desk Rejection  
 Papers should not attempt to "squeeze space" by exploiting underspecified formatting criteria (e.g., columns) or through manipulating other document properties (e.g., page layout, spacing, fonts, figures and tables, headings). Papers that, in the chair's assessment, make use of these techniques to receive an unfair advantage, will be rejected, even if they comply with the above specifications. We offer several examples  of observed techniques that have or could lead to rejection. Authors should seek to meet page limits through the modification of content alone. Any other techniques (whether appearing in these examples or not) may result in rejection.  
 Please make sure your paper successfully returns from the PDF checker (visible upon PDF submission) and that document properties, such as font size and margins, can be verified via PDF editing tools such as Adobe Acrobat. Papers where the chairs can not verify compliance with the CFP will be rejected.  
 During the paper submission, the authors need to select among the available topics the ones that are more appropriate for their work. A failure to select topics or a clear attempt at selecting inappropriate or misleading entries may be grounds for administrative rejection.  
 Internet Defense Prize  
 The Internet Defense Prize recognizes and rewards research that meaningfully makes the internet more secure. Created in 2014, the award is funded by Meta and offered in partnership with USENIX to celebrate contributions to the protection and defense of the internet. Successful recipients of the Internet Defense Prize will provide a working prototype that demonstrates significant contributions to the security of the internet, particularly in the areas of prevention and defense. This award is meant to recognize the direction of the research and not necessarily its progress to date. The intent of the award is to inspire researchers to focus on high-impact areas of research. The USENIX Security Awards Committee—selected by the Program Chairs among the symposium Program Committee members—independently determines the prize, to be distributed by USENIX.  
 You may submit your USENIX Security '25 paper submission for consideration for the Prize as part of the regular submission process.  
 Contact Information  
 Specific questions about submissions may be sent to the program co-chairs at sec25chairs@usenix.org  . The chairs will respond to individual questions about the submission process if contacted at least a week before the submission deadline.  
 Further questions? Contact your program co-chairs, sec25chairs@usenix.org  , or the USENIX office, submissionspolicy@usenix.org  .

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.  
 Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

 Conference Overview  
   
 In this digital age, data plays a crucial role Businesses/organizations across the globe are striving to analyze the data and identify the trends. Data evaluations also give organizations new insights to questions that they hadn’t even thought of. This creates a positive impact on discovering new business opportunities. Data visualization and visual analytics are two such ways to gain better insights into data. Though often used interchangeably, these two terms are inherently different as are their approaches to data. This International Conference on Visual Analytics and Data Visualization (ICVADV-2025) covers all research, development, and application aspects of Visual Analytics and Data Visualization. This international conference event intends to serve as a platform for discussing the recent advances in algorithms, methods, theory, and applications of visual analytics and data visualization. The conference encourages the discussion on recent findings in the design and utilization of data analytics and visualization tools.

 Conference Overview  
   
 In this digital age, data plays a crucial role Businesses/organizations across the globe are striving to analyze the data and identify the trends. Data evaluations also give organizations new insights to questions that they hadn’t even thought of. This creates a positive impact on discovering new business opportunities. Data visualization and visual analytics are two such ways to gain better insights into data. Though often used interchangeably, these two terms are inherently different as are their approaches to data. This International Conference on Visual Analytics and Data Visualization (ICVADV-2025) covers all research, development, and application aspects of Visual Analytics and Data Visualization. This international conference event intends to serve as a platform for discussing the recent advances in algorithms, methods, theory, and applications of visual analytics and data visualization. The conference encourages the discussion on recent findings in the design and utilization of data analytics and visualization tools.

 VECoS  
 Verification and Evaluation  
  of Computer and Communication Systems  

  The International Conference on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and Communication Systems (VECoS) was created by an Euro-Med network of researchers in computer science. The aim of the VECoS conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners, in the areas of verification, control, performance, quality of service, dependability evaluation and assessment, in order to discuss the state-of-the-art and the challenges in modern computer and communication systems in which functional and non-functional properties are strongly interrelated. Thus, the main motivation for VECoS is to encourage the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, and especially those based on the specification formalisms for concurrent, distributed and software/hardware systems. Beyond its technical and scientific goals, another main purpose of VECoS is to promote collaboration between participants in research and education in the area of computer science and engineering.

  Call For Papers   
   
 Overview The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected. There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers. Submission Type: Full vs. Short USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper. For further details, see the submission instructions. Deployed Systems Track USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track. Early Rejection Notifications USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent. Authors' Response Period USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above. Confidentiality All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. On the Use of Generative AI While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers including sections generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org. Questions? Please direct any questions to the program co-chairs at atc25chairs@usenix.org or to the USENIX office at submissionspolicy@usenix.org.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-08-13

 Abstract   
   
 The virtual machine abstraction provides a wide variety of benefits which have undeniably enabled cloud computing. Virtual machines, however, are a double-edged sword as hypervisors they run on top of must treat them as a black box, limiting the information which the hypervisor and virtual machine may exchange, a problem known as the semantic gap. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a new mechanism, hyperupcalls, which enables a hypervisor to safely execute verified code provided by a guest virtual machine in order to transfer information. Hyperupcalls are written in C and have complete access to guest data structures such as page tables. We provide a complete framework which makes it easy to access familiar kernel functions from within a hyperupcall. Compared to state-of-the-art paravirtualization techniques and virtual machine introspection, Hyperupcalls are much more flexible and less intrusive. We demonstrate that hyperupcalls can not only be used to improve guest performance for certain operations by up to 2× but hyperupcalls can also serve as a powerful debugging and security tool.

 USENIX Security '25 Reviewing Model  

 Summary of main changes from previous editions   
 Major revisions are submitted and reviewed during the same submission cycle as the initial submission. 
   
 Submissions Deadlines  
 The Symposium will accept submissions in two cycles in 2025. For USENIX Security '25, the first deadline will be September 4, 2024  , and the second will be January 22, 2025  .  
 Review Process Outcomes  
 The reviewing process will result in one of the following four outcomes:  
 Accepted | In this case, reviewers either see no need for any required edits—the paper could be published as is—or trust the authors to make any required edits. 
  Accepted on Shepherd Approval | These papers offer sufficient contributions to be in the USENIX Security program, but the reviewers feel that some changes are needed. Reviewers expect that these changes are highly unlikely to reduce their enthusiasm regarding the paper being published. These can include text changes, clarifications, and presentation of missing results that do not require additional experiments. 
  Invited for Major Revision | A clear path exists to strengthen the paper to a state that is likely adequate for the paper to be accepted. The reviewers have identified a well-defined set of additions and changes necessary to bring the paper to this state. Unlike | Accepted on Shepherd Approval | , the effect of these changes is too unpredictable for it to be feasible to decide in advance whether a revised paper will be acceptable for publication (e.g., new experiments need to be run whose outcomes are uncertain). There is no guarantee that the paper will be accepted, but we expect a high acceptance rate for these papers (as currently happens with | Major Revisions | ). 
  Rejected | This outcome indicates that the reviewers do not see a well-defined path from the present state to acceptance. For example, reviewers may not see the scientific contribution as adequately significant, or the idea is acceptable but reviewers struggle to offer well-defined changes to address identified technical issues. Reviews for such papers will attempt to identify major changes that could move the paper toward a publishable state. | Authors may not resubmit these papers in the next review cycle. 
  Shepherding and Revision Processes  
 Authors of papers submitted to USENIX Security '25 that have been accepted on shepherd approval or invited for major revision may submit a revised version of their papers only within the review cycle during which the paper was originally submitted  . Such papers that were originally submitted in the first cycle of USENIX Security '25 may not be resubmitted in the second cycle.  
 For both Accepted on shepherd approval  and Invited for major revision  , each paper will have one shepherd  . This shepherd will be agreed upon by the reviewers, and will be in charge of communicating expectations to authors and, eventually, communicating whether the paper has met the criteria for acceptance. The shepherd may consult with other reviewers.  
 All shepherding activities will happen through anonymous author-visible comments on HotCRP. All reviewers will be able to see these exchanges.

  New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy  
 Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.  
 Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.  
 Replication and Reproduction:  Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.  
 Systematization of Knowledge  
 USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey); they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 While both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that an SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. For examples, please see the list of SoK papers that recently appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 The titles of SoK submissions should be prefixed with "SoK:". Research Ethics  
 Authors of all  submissions must consider the ethics of their work even if, a priori, they do not think that this section on ethical considerations applies to them.  
 Without sufficient precautions, research endeavors can lead to negative outcomes. People or other entities, like companies, might experience negative outcomes during the research process itself, immediately after the research is published, or in the future. These negative outcomes might be in the form of tangible harms (e.g., financial loss or exposure to psychologically disturbing content). Or, these negative outcomes could be violations of human rights even if there are no directly tangible harms (e.g., the violation of a participants' right to informed consent or the violation of users' right to privacy via the study of data that users expect and desire to be private). Further, due to the complexity of today's computing systems, people could experience these negative outcomes either directly or indirectly in unexpected ways (see The Menlo Report  ).  
 We expect authors to carefully and proactively consider and address potential negative outcomes associated with carrying out their research, as well as potential negative outcomes that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so may result in rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although causing negative outcomes is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, considering the well-being of the research team, and following ethical disclosure practices.  
 Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of every submission. To facilitate their review, all papers must  include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. For more information, see the submission policies and instructions  and the ethics guideline  document. Authors should understand that, sometimes, the right ethical decision is not  to do a project or to change how a project is done. Thus, authors are encouraged to read the ethics portion of the submission instructions and the ethics guidelines document as early as possible in their research process, ideally before initiating their research  , though it is understood that some projects may have been started before this CFP has been posted. Authors are further encouraged to revisit these guidelines throughout the research, publication, and post-publication processes.  
 Open Science  
 This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default  . This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. If, for some reason (such as licensing restrictions), artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Artifacts need to be available for the Artifact Evaluation committee after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability  after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality  and reproducibility  after final papers are due. All artifacts mentioned in accepted papers will be checked for availability. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts to also be checked for functionality and reproducibility.  
 Artifacts should be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).  
 The Call for Artifacts will be available soon.

 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. USENIX allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Papers accepted during the first reviewing cycle will be published on the USENIX Security website shortly after the conclusion of the first reviewing cycle. Papers accepted during the second reviewing cycle will be published on the first day of the symposium.  
 See the Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 New Approach to Presentation of Papers  
 Motivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talks, tentatively 15 minutes long; others will be shorter presentations, tentatively between 30 seconds and one minute long. Accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized discussion sessions that will run in parallel with talk sessions. Finally, authors of accepted papers will be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security website. Preparation of posters and uploaded videos will not be mandatory.

 UCNC 2021   
 Aims and Scope  
 The International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation (UCNC) is a meeting where scientists from many different backgrounds are united in their interest in novel forms of computation, human-designed computation inspired by nature, and computational aspects of natural processes. UCNC provides a forum for these scientists to meet and discuss their work. The 19th UCNC will be hosted by Aalto University in Espoo, within the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland.  
 The conference proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. Extended versions of selected papers from the proceedings will appear in a special issue of the Natural Computing  journal.  
 Topics of interest  
 Papers and poster presentations are sought in all areas that relate to unconventional computation and natural computation. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome. Typical, but not exclusive, topics are:

 VINCI 2024    
  
 Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among human beings of different backgrounds or cultures, and in recent decades between humans and machines. In today's digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly being used to facilitate human-human communication through the Internet and mobile devices.   
 VINCI is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the state of the art in visual communication theories, designs, and applications.  The 17th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction   (VINCI'24)   will be held during  December   11  -  13  , 2024, in Hsinchu, Taiwan.   
 VINCI'24 includes tracks of  Technical Papers  ,  Art Papers  , and  Art and Media Galleries  . All accepted papers will be included in the ACM Proceedings as formal publications and EI-indexed. Selected papers will be invited to be extended for publication i  n special issues of  PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality   (SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months) and   International Journal of Digital Media Design   (Taiwan Humanities Core Index)  .   

 Paper Submission    
  
 Submissions that address research and development and experience reports on the above topics are strongly encouraged. Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers and posters. Art and Media Galleries can be submitted as media demos and artworks. Each submitted symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee members. You are welcome to submit a paper to VINCI 2024. All accepted papers and posters will appear in the proceedings of VINCI 2024 published by ACM ICPS and made available in the  ACM Digital Library   (EI indexed). Authors of a number of selected full papers of high quality will be invited to prepare extended versions for submission to the  special issues of  PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality   (  SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months  ) and   International Journal of Digital Media Design   (  Taiwan Humanities Core Index  )  .   
 All paper submissions should be made through the  CMT    conference management system. The review process will be single-blind. We encourage to submit an anonymized version of your manuscript by removing all author and affiliation information from submissions and supplemental files as well as substituting your paper's ID number for the author's name. All submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the  ACM Proceedings Template    (using sigconf format/template double-column style) and should consist of a single PDF file.   
 Please note: the authors of accepted papers will be later requested to submit source Latex or Word files during camera-ready version submission. We appreciate the submission of videos or other supplemental material. Please provide supplemental videos in MPEG-4, and use PNG for supplemental images, both in sufficient resolution. In case of any questions related to the submission process or conference program, please contact the program chairs via  [email protected]   .

 Tracks    

 Technical Papers:   
 A technical paper describes a new algorithm, technique, system, or theory that has not previously appeared in the literature. The description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent/qualified graduate student in visual information communication could implement or apply the work and should provide a formal/informal evaluation and discussion regarding its strengths and weaknesses.   
 The technical papers call is open-theme, and this year, we have three types in the Technical Papers: full papers, short papers and posters.   
 The page limits are strict so please ensure that you meet the requirements:   
 Full Papers: max. 8 pages INCL. references 
  Short Papers: max. 4 pages+1 extra page which contains ONLY referernces 
  Posters: max. 2 pages INCL. references 
  ACM also requires you to specify the CSS concepts in your paper. These can be found at:   http://dl.acm.org/ccs.cfm 
  Art Papers:   
 This track serves as a link between arts, design, technology, and science by offering creative views and artistic applications. We are especially interested in the submissions that demonstrate tangible and artistic ways of visual information communication and address information aesthetics. The topics range from experimental and interdisciplinary case studies and methodologies, novel and critical interfaces for VINCI topics to critical analysis of theory and reference works in the field.   
 The art papers call is open-theme, and this year, we have three types in the Art Papers: full papers, short papers and posters.

  Art and Media Galleries:   
 The VINCI Art and Media Galleries celebrates artistic creations demonstrating conceptual and technological innovation related to visual information communication and interaction. We accept project topics, including data art, generative art and design, interactive graphics, real-time simulation, scientific illustration, creative and critical visualization, and more. The art and media g  aller  ies call is open-theme, and this year, we have two types in the Art and Media Galleries:  Media Demos  and  Artworks  .   
 Media Demos: It seeks submissions from media creators, producers, researchers, developers, startups, universities, institutes, companies, and others who can demonstrate novel experiences, productions, and applications (e.g., Metaverse or Digital Twin). 
  Artworks: It welcomes all forms and formats, exploring new artistic expression, creativity, and creation possibilities in any 2-dimensional form suitable for display on a digital screen or canvas. We also encourage submissions of innovative AIGC artworks. 
  Submissions for both types should include up to  2 pages  of poster/description/artist’s statement. Works should have been completed within the last 5 years (in or after 2019) and be ready for installation. While we don't restrict previously exhibited work, accompanying materials should not have been published or accepted for publication elsewhere.   
 Selected works will be exhibited at the National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University. We will collaborate with selected artists to discuss exhibition logistics and final display arrangements. Unless specified otherwise, artists are responsible for covering shipping costs for physical objects.

 Visual communication, using graphical or sign languages, has been a long-standing practice among individuals of diverse backgrounds or cultures. It has also evolved to include communication between humans and machines. In today's digital era, visual information is encoded using familiar metaphors to enhance comprehension and analysis. This encompasses information visualization, graphical user-interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly utilized for .. continue reading   human-human communication through the internet and mobile devices. The International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI) serves as a prominent platform for experts to discuss visual communication theories, designs, and applications. VINCI '23 will take place in Guangzhou, China. Selected papers may be published in The Visual Computer (Springer) and Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine and Art (Springer).

 📣 Upcoming Edition: VISSOFT 2025  @ Auckland, New Zealand  
  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.

  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.

  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.
