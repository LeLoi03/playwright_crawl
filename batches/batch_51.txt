 Call for Papers  
  
 Embedded system design faces many challenges both with respect to functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements, many of which are conflicting. They are found in areas such as design and developer productivity, verification, validation, maintainability, and meeting performance goals and resource constraints. Novel design-time and run-time approaches are needed to meet the demand of emerging applications and to exploit new hardware paradigms, and in particular to scale up to multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from multicores.  
   
  LCTES 2017 will take place at the premises of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)  , located in the south of Barcelona, close to the airport and to the city centre.  
 LCTES 2017 solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications.  
   
  Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics in embedded systems:  
 Programming language challenges, including: 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging architectures 
  Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems 
  Language capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of embedded systems 
  Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability, and security 
  Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and memory management 
  Compiler challenges, including: 
  Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and compilers 
  Interpreters, binary translation, just-in- time compilation, and split compilation 
  Support for enhanced programmer productivity 
  Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt handling 
  Optimization for low power/energy, code and data size, and best-effort and real-time performance 
  Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and auto-tuning 
  Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including: 
  Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces 
  Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable architectures 
  System integration and testing 
  Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning 
  Run-time system support for embedded systems 
  Design space exploration tools 
  Support for system security and system-level reliability 
  Approaches for cross-layer system optimization 
  Theory and foundations of embedded systems, including: 
  Predictability of resource behaviour: energy, space, time 
  Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed systems 
  Formal foundations of model-based design as basis for code generation, analysis, and verification 
  Mathematical foundations for embedded systems 
  Models of computations for embedded applications 
  Novel embedded architectures, including: 
  Design and implementation of novel architectures 
  Workload analysis and performance evaluation 
  Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler techniques, debugging tools 
  Architectural features to improve power/energy, code/data size, and predictability 
  Mobile systems and IoT, including: 
  Operating systems for mobile and IoT devices 
  Compiler and software tools for mobile and IoT systems 
  Energy management for mobile and IoT devices 
  Memory and IO techniques for mobile and IoT devices

  All accepted papers will appear in the published proceedings. We expect to make a best paper award.   
   
  Important Dates:   

 Paper submission: | 20 February 2017 (11:59 PM EST) 
 Author notification: | 31 March 2017 
 Final version: | 15 April 2017 (tentative) 

 Submission  
  
 Formatting Guidelines:   
  Submissions must be in ACM proceedings format, 9-point type, and may not exceed 10 pages (all inclusive). Word and LaTeX templates for this format are available on the ACM website  . Submissions must be in PDF, printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  
  
 The submission site is: https://lctes17.hotcrp.com

  Call for Papers @ Fifth Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2025)  
 Dates: 9-12 September 2025  
 Location: Naples, Italy  
 Twitter: https://x.com/LDKconference   
 Submission Deadline: 06/03/2025  
 Submission page: https://openreview.net/group?id=LDK/2025/Conference   
  We invite submissions to the fifth biennial conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2025) to be held in Naples, Italy in September 2025. This conference aims to bring together researchers from across different disciplines concerned with the acquisition, treatment, curation and the use of language data in the context of data science and knowledge-based applications. This edition builds upon the success of the inaugural event held in Galway, Ireland in 2017, the second LDK in Leipzig, Germany in 2019, the third LDK in Zaragoza, Spain in 2021, and the fourth LDK in Vienna, Austria in 2023.  
 Paper Submission   
 We welcome submissions of relevance to the topics listed below. Submissions can be in the form of:  
 Long papers: 9–12 pages; 
  Short papers: 4–6 pages. 
  All submission lengths are given including references. Accepted submissions will be published in an open-access conference proceedings volume and indexed in ACL anthology and DBLP, free of charge for authors. The ACL templates  should therefore be used for all conference submissions.  
 As the reviewing process is single-blind, submissions should not be anonymised.  Papers should be submitted via OpenReview at the following address:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=LDK/2025/Conference   
 All papers must represent original work. When submitted, the submission must not have been previously published*, and the material in it must not have been/be submitted for review at another journal or conference while under review at LDK 2025.  
 *This excludes papers on preprint archives, such as arXiv, which we do not consider to have been previously published.  
 The conference will be hybrid (face-to-face and remote). Note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the paper at the conference (either remotely or on-site).

 Call for Papers  
  
 Embedded system design faces many challenges both with respect to functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements, many of which are conflicting. They are found in areas such as design and developer productivity, verification, validation, maintainability, and meeting performance goals and resource constraints. Novel design-time and run-time approaches are needed to meet the demand of emerging applications and to exploit new hardware paradigms, and in particular to scale up to multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from multicores.  
 LCTES 2018 solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications.  
 Paper Categories   
 Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work. 
  Work-in-progress paper: 2-4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. 
  Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM.

 Submission  
   
 Formatting Guidelines:  Submissions must be in ACM proceedings format, double-column, 10-point type, and may not exceed 10 pages for full papers and 4 pages for work-in-progress papers (not including references; there is no page limit for references for both categories of papers.)  For papers in the work-in-progress categories, please prepend "WIP: " in front of the title. To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  
 The ACM template  can be found at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  .  
 The submission site:  is https://lctes18.hotcrp.com  .

   KES-AMSTA 2025 conference   
  
 We participate at the 18th International KES Conference on AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS  , KES-AMSTA-25. KES-AMSTA is an international scientific conference for research in the field of agent and multi-agent systems. Agents and multi-agent systems are related to a modern software paradigm which has long been recognized as a promising technology for constructing autonomous, complex and intelligent systems. Consisting of keynote talks by experts in the field, oral and poster presentations, AMSTA-24 will provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to discuss modern approaches and techniques for agent and multi-agent systems and their applications, as well as intelligent systems in the field of social networks, self-organisation and trust.  
 Proceedings    
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer as book chapters in a volume of the KES Smart Innovation Systems and Technologies series, submitted for indexing in Scopus and Thomson-Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) and the Web of Science.  
 Smart Digital Futures  
 Smart Digital Futures  2024 is a multi-conference event co-locating five conferences on leading edge smart systems topics in a beautiful location. One conference fee gives you entry to six high-quality conferences on Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare, Human Centred Intelligent Systems, Intelligent Decision Technologies, Intelligent Interactive Multimedia Systems and Services, Agent and Multi-agent Systems, Smart Transportation Systems and Smart Education and E-Learning, and a paper published in one set of proceedings.  
 The event will take place in Solin, Croatia. More information could be found at the conference website http://amsta-25.kesinternational.org/   
 Invited sessions on "AGENT-BASED MODELING AND SIMULATION (ABMS)"  
 As usual we are also organizing an invited session on "AGENT-BASED MODELING AND SIMULATION (ABMS)". Computational social science involves the use of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) to study complex social systems. ABMS consists of a set of agents and a framework for simulating their decisions and interactions. ABMS is related to a variety of other simulation techniques, including discrete event simulation and distributed artificial intelligence or multi-agent systems. Although many traits are shared, ABMS is differentiated from these approaches by its focus on finding the set of basic decision rules and behavioral interactions that can produce the complex results experienced in the real world. An agent is thus a software representation of a decision-making unit. Agents are self-directed objects with specific traits and typically exhibit bounded rationality, that is, they make decisions by using limited internal decision rules that depend only on imperfect local information. In practice, each agent has only partial knowledge of other agents and each agent makes its own decisions based on the partial knowledge about other agents in the system. We welcome all kinds of papers discussing aforementioned approaches from different domains in this section. We look forward to getting an attractive discussion in Solin 2025.  
 More information could be found at the conference website in a "Invited sessions" section http://amsta-25.kesinternational.org/cmsISdisplay.php

 About  
  
 Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK) aims at bringing together researchers from across disciplines concerned with the acquisition, curation and use of language data in the context of data science and knowledge-based applications. With the advent of the Web and digital technologies, an ever increasing amount of language data is now available across application areas and industry sectors, including social media, digital archives, company records, etc. The efficient and meaningful exploitation of this data in scientific and commercial innovation is at the core of data science research, employing NLP and machine learning methods as well as semantic technologies based on knowledge graphs  
 Language data is of increasing importance to machine learning-based approaches in NLP, Linked Data and Semantic Web research and applications that depend on linguistic and semantic annotation with lexical, terminological and ontological resources, manual alignment across language or other human-assigned labels. The acquisition, provenance, representation, maintenance, usability, quality as well as legal, organizational and infrastructure aspects of language data are therefore rapidly becoming major areas of research that are at the focus of the conference.  
 Knowledge graphs is an active field of research concerned with the extraction, integration, maintenance and use of semantic representations of language data in combination with semantically or otherwise structured data, numerical data and multimodal data among others. Knowledge graph research builds on the exploitation and extension of lexical, terminological and ontological resources, information and knowledge extraction, entity linking, ontology learning, ontology alignment, semantic text similarity, Linked Data and other Semantic Web technologies. The construction and use of knowledge graphs from language data, possibly and ideally in the context of other types of data, is a further specific focus of the conference.  
 A further focus of the conference is the combined use and exploitation of language data and knowledge graphs in data science-based approaches to use cases in industry, including biomedical applications, as well as use cases in humanities and social sciences.  
 We are also happy to announce that the LDK Conference has been included in the CORE ranking in 2022.  
 The ethics and integrity policy of the conference is available here  .

 Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, large language models, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints. The 25th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2024) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted to https://lctes24.hotcrp.com/. Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest including, but not limited to: Programming language challenges Domain-specific languages Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging architectures Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems Capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of embedded systems Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability, and security Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and memory management Compiler challenges Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and compilers Interpreters, binary translation, just-in-time compilation, and split compilation Support for enhanced programmer productivity Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt handling Optimization for low power/energy, code/data size, and real-time performance Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and auto-tuning Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including: Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable architectures System integration and testing Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning Run-time system support for embedded systems Design space exploration tools Support for system security and system-level reliability Approaches for cross-layer system optimization Theory and foundations of embedded systems Predictability of resource behavior: energy, space, time Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed systems Formal foundations of model-based design as the basis for code generation, analysis, and verification Mathematical foundations for embedded systems Models of computations for embedded applications Novel embedded architectures Design and implementation of novel architectures Workload analysis and performance evaluation Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler techniques, debugging tools Architectural features to improve power/energy, code/data size, and predictability Mobile systems and IoT Operating systems for mobile and IoT devices Compiler and software tools for mobile and IoT systems Energy management for mobile and IoT devices Memory and IO techniques for mobile and IoT devices Large language models (LLMs) and programming languages/compilers Impact of LLMs on embedded system design and architectures LLM-based debugging tools for embedded software Adapting LLMs for resource-constraint environment LLM for embedded systems and compilers LLM for program analysis, testing and verification.

 Fortieth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on   
  Logic in Computer Science (LICS)   
  Singapore • 23–26 June 2025    

  Call for Papers  
 The 40th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2025) will be held in Singapore, from 23 – 26 June, with workshops 27 and 28 June. The LICS  Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to logic, broadly construed. We invite submissions on topics that fit under that rubric. Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:  
 automata theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming, constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures, description logics, domain theory finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability, foundations of probabilistic, real-time and hybrid systems, games and logic, higher-order logic, knowledge representation and reasoning, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic, logic programming logical aspects of AI logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation logical frameworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof theory, reasoning about security and privacy, rewriting, type systems, type theory, and verification.  

 Instructions to Authors  
 Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of about 100 words in advance of submitting the full paper. The exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth   (AoE).  

 Titles and Short Abstracts Due | 16 January 2025 
 Full Papers Due | 23 January 2025 
 Author Response Period | 17–20 March 2025 
 Author Notification | 8 April 2025 
 Conference | 23 – 26 June 2025 
 Workshops | 27 – 28 June 2025 

 Submission deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered. All submissions will be electronic via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25   .  
 Formatting instructions:  Every full paper must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10pt format and may be at most 12 pages, excluding references. Please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, updated 2024, LaTeX style files are available at ieee.org  .  
 The paper must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work must be included. (If necessary detailed proofs of technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members.) Submissions not conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further consideration. Papers authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed, with at most one submission per PC member.  
 Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. The program chair must be informed, in advance of submission, of any closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a conference or journal. Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release forms. One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. Remote presentations can be organized for authors who are not to be able to attend the meeting.  
 LICS 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Following this process means that reviewers will not see the authors' names or affiliations as they initially review a paper. The authors' names will then be revealed to the reviewers only once their reviews have been submitted.  
 To facilitate this process, submitted papers must adhere to the following:  
 Author names and institutions must be omitted and 
  References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references (to papers or tools) should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  
 Kleene Award, Distinguished Papers and Special Issues  
 An award in honor of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the best student paper(s), as judged by the program committee.  
 Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected as distinguished papers. These are papers that, in the view of the LICS program committee, make exceptionally strong contribution to the field and should be read by a broad audience due their relevance, originality, significance and clarity.  
 Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the program committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Additional selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.  
 Publication  
 The official publication date may differ from the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. We will clarify the official publication date in due course.

11. Conference LICS_3:
IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science   

 LICS Home   -  LICS Awards   -  LICS Newsletters   -  LICS Archive   -  LICS Organization   -  Logic-Related Conferences     

  LICS Awards  
 LICS Test-of-Time Award  
 The LICS Test-of-Time Award recognizes a small number of papers from the LICS proceedings from 20 years prior (i.e., papers from LICS 1986 — the first LICS conference — were considered in 2006) that have best met the "test of time".  
  The papers are selected by an awards committee that is appointed by the LICS General Chair and consists of between three to five members. The committee is renewed every year; at the discretion of the General Chair, members may be reappointed to the awards committee.  
  In selecting these papers, the Awards Committee should consider the influence that the papers have had since publication; because of the foundational nature of LICS work, impact is often not fully felt immediately, hence the 20-year perspective.  
  The Award Committee is expected to select 1–2 papers. However, the Award Committee may choose to select no paper from a given year, or may select up to 3 papers.  
  All papers from the given year are eligible for this award, except those that are authored or co-authored by members of the Awards Committee. There is no formal nomination process for this award, but input from the LICS community is welcome.

 Kleene Award for the Best Student Paper  
 Each year, an award in honour of the late S.C. Kleene is given for the best student paper accepted at the LICS conference.  
  To be considered for the Kleene award each  coauthor of the paper should satisfy one of the following criteria:  
 the author is a current student, or 
  the author graduated recently and the submission is based on the author's work during student days. 
  The papers are selected by the LICS program committee; the committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several papers.

 Due to the current wave of the pandemic, LFCS 2022 was held in the online format.   The list of talks with links to their videos is at the bottom of this page.  
 The Springer LFCS 2022 volume, LNCS 13137, is now available online and can be accessed at http://link.springer.com/openurl.asp?genre=issue&issn=0302-9743&volume=13137  .  

 About LFCS  
 The LFCS series provides an outlet for the fast-growing body of work in the logical foundations of computer science, e.g., areas of fundamental theoretical logic related to computer science. The LFCS series began with Logic at Botik, Pereslavl-Zalessky, 1989 and was co-organized by Albert R. Meyer (MIT) and Michael Taitslin (Tver), after which organization passed to Anil Nerode in 1992. LFCS has enjoyed support and endorsements from a number of bodies, including the US National Science Foundation (NSF), Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL), Cornell University, and the City University of New York Research Foundation.

  Research profile   
   
 The Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) continues to lead the way in the development of mathematical models, algorithms, theories and tools that probe the possibilities of computation and communication.  
 Our students benefit from being part of one of the largest and strongest groups of theoretical computer scientists in the world.  
 Our research is aimed at establishing deep understanding of computation in its many forms. Using advanced mathematical principles, we create theories and software tools allowing fundamental capabilities of computation to be explored, as well as designing languages that can be used to construct safe and effective programs.  
 Areas of interest within LFCS include: algorithms and complexity, cryptography, databases, logic, programming languages and semantics, performance modelling, quantum computing, security and privacy, software modelling and testing, and verification.

 LOPSTR was founded by Kung-Kiu Lau  in 1991. It has taken place annually since.  
 The next LOPSTR symposium, LOPSTR 2024  , will be held in Milan (Italy) in September 9-11, 2024.  
 Its original title was International Workshop on Logic Program Synthesis and Transformation  , and the workshop was intended to focus on logic programs. The title was changed to International Workshop on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation  in 1998 to reflect a widening of its scope. It was changed to International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation  in 2002.  
 Currently, the aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm.  
 LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
   LOPSTR is usually co-located with PPDP ( International ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming  ).  
 You can find here  the old LOPSTR website maintained by Kung-Kiu Lau  .  

 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
  transformation 
  specialization 
  composition 
  optimization 
  inversion 
  specification 
  analysis and verification 
  testing and certification 
  program and model manipulation 
  AI-methods for program development 
  verification and testing of AI-based systems 
  logic-based methods for security, cyber-physical and distributed systems 
  transformational techniques in software engineering 
  applications, tools and industrial practice

 Logic-Based Neural Networks 
 Abstract  :  
   
  Progress in computing thrives from progress in a diversity of fields. Matrices and Linear Algebra, an old stalwart of computing, are nowadays at the core of much work in Artificial Intelligence. Formalisms based on Mathematical Logic, such as propositional logic datalog, or logic programming enable principled programming where one can distinguish meaning from execution. Graphs arise naturally in programming, and are often used to understand properties of data.  
 The presentation starts by quickly mentioning some important properties connecting these areas. Graphs can encode programs, and they can be encoded as matrices which can be encoded by programs themselves. This connection has led to interest in combining the approaches into a single system, and has led to developments such as Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and the neuro-symbolic systems.  
 The SRL approach is about dealing with uncertainty on structured domains. In a simplest form, it can be seen as extending a graphical network with repeated information: say, students that perform well in Algebra I will also perform well in Algebra II. Logical rules can be used to express this common information, as exemplified in CLP(BN), an extension of Prolog that builds directed acyclic graphs with probabilistic annotations, that is, Bayesian networks. A different approach is used in Problog. This language is also based in Prolog but it softens the language by introducing Probabilistic facts. These facts can be used to abduce on different values, but they can also be used to give probability to rules. One should also mention Markov Logic Networks. In these models, logic atoms are connected in clauses. These connections generate an undirected graphical model.  
 One problem with these models is that they may require heavy temporal and memory resources and can quickly become expensive. Deep neural networks have become successful by implementing a compound function f = f 0  • f 1  ... f n  , where each f i  is a layer. Layers can be implemented through matrices and parameter learning can use the derivative of f to optimize parameters through gradient based search.  
 This development has led to rapid growth in the landscape of neuro-symbolic models. TensorLog is an influential example that constructs a deep neural network out of logical rules. This is achieved through restriction to chain-rules, where each goal has a single input variable, shared with the previous goal, and a single output variable, connected to the next goal. The model is suited for edge-detection problems, where it performs well but is not ideal for pure classification. Several extensions have been proposed; we discuss how one, NeuralLog, tackles this problem. Notice these are but a few examples; very different approaches exist, such as Deep-Problog.  
 Meanwhile, there has been further progress in neural networks. Graph Neural Networks are close in many ways to logic based proposals but are based on graph theory, so they approach learning in a different way to logic based systems. But focus has settled on Large Language Models. Although most developments are empirical, there exist already proposals for logic reasoning in LLMs, such as LOGIC-LLM and LOGICLM. We expect to see others soon. 

 Ningning Xie  ,  University of Toronto, Canada, speaker shared with PPDP 2024 
 Safe and Easy Compile-Time Generative Programming 
 Abstract  :  
   
  Program generation is a powerful and expressive approach to eliminating abstraction overhead and improving program performance, which has been studied and implemented in a variety of languages with different forms.  
 In this talk we overview MacoCaml, a new design and implementation of compile-time computation for OCaml. MacoCaml features a unifying and novel combination of phase separation and quotation-based staging. We review MacoCaml's recent developments, including a comprehensive formalism of a feature-rich macro calculus with key meta-theoretic properties, and an extension to module functors that leads to explicit phase distinction. We describe how the meta-theoretical results offer practical benefits for programmers, and conclude the talk with a few directions for future exploration. 

 Overview  
   
 The aim of the LOPSTR series  is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
 LOPSTR 2024 will be held in-person at Politecnico Milano  in Milan, Italy and, as part of FM 2024  , will be co-located with PPDP 2024  , TAP 2024  , FACS 2024  , and FMICS 2024  . At least one of the authors of an accepted paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel will be made available later.  
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
  transformation 
  specialization 
  inversion 
  composition 
  optimisation 
  specification 
  analysis and verification 
    
 testing and certification 
  program and model manipulation 
  AI-methods for program development 
  verification and testing of AI-based systems 
  transformational techniques in software engineering 
  logic-based methods for security 
  logic-based methods for cyber-physical and distributed system 
  applications, tools and industrial practice 

 Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial applications and case studies are also welcome.  

 History

 Call for papers  
   
 The call for papers can be found here  .  

 PAPER SUBMISSION  
   
 Submissions can be made in two categories:  
 Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
  Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
    
 References do NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings.  
 Submissions of Regular Papers  must describe the original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chairs in case of questions).  
 Submissions of Short Papers  may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research and tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool.  
  
 All accepted papers  will be included  in the conference proceedings  and published  by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  volume.  
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication  in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  . Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the standard reviewing process of the journal.  

 Submission Guidelines  
   
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's author instructions at the author's page  , and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX  (available also in overleaf  ) or for Word  , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCID identifiers  in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form  . The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.    
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
  \usepackage{lineno}  
  \linenumbers  
   Papers should be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2024

 Title  : Unification Modulo Equational Theories in Languages with Binding Operators 
 Abtract  : Unification (i.e., solving equations between terms) is a key step in the implementation of logic programming languages and theorem provers and is also used in type inference algorithms for functional languages and as a mechanism to analyse rewrite-based specifications (e.g., to find critical pairs). Matching is a version of unification in which only one of the terms in the equation can be instantiated.  
  Often, operators satisfy equational axioms (e.g., associativity commutativity), which must be taken into account during the unification or matching process. In addition, when the expressions to be unified involve binding operators (as is the case when representing programs, logics, computation models, etc.), unification and matching algorithms must take into account the alpha-equivalence relation generated by the binders.  
  In this talk, we present matching and unification algorithms for languages that include binding operators as well as operators that satisfy equational axioms, such as associativity and commutativity. 

 Manuel Hermenegildo  , IMDEA Software Institute and Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain (sponsored by ALP). 
 Title  : On-The-Fly Verification via Incremental, Interactive Abstract Interpretation with CiaoPP and VeriFly 
 Abtract  : Ciao Prolog pioneered the idea of being able to optionally and gradually add assertions or contracts to programs in order to offer formal guarantees, a now very popular solution for solving the classic trade-offs between dynamic and static languages. This approach is enabled by Ciao’s program analysis and verification framework, CiaoPP, which performs abstract interpretation-based context- and path-sensitive analysis to infer information against which assertions are checked to achieve verification or flag errors statically. The framework supports multiple other languages in addition to Prolog, from machine code to smart contracts, by translation into Horn clauses. Program semantics is computed over different user-definable abstract domains, via efficient fixpoint computation. This allows inference and verification of both functional and non-functional properties, including, e.g., energy or ’gas’ consumption.  
  While this type of verification can be performed offline (e.g., as part of con- tinuous integration) it is very useful when it occurs interactively during software development, flagging errors as the program is written. However, while context- and path-sensitive global analysis over complex domains can provide the preci- sion needed for effective verification and optimization, it can also be expensive when applied to large code bases, sometimes making interactive use impracti- cal. On the other hand, in many program development situations modifications are small and isolated within a few components. The modular and incremental fixpoint algorithms used by CiaoPP take advantage of this to reuse as much as possible previous analysis results, reducing response times in interactive use.  
  In this talk we will review these ideas and show how the integration of the Ciao abstract interpretation framework within different IDEs takes advantage of our efficient and incremental fixpoint to achieve effective verification on-the-fly as the program is developed. We also demonstrate a number of embeddings of this framework within the browser, and show as an example an application for building interactive tutorials, which we have used for teaching verification and abstract interpretation.

 Overview  
   
 The aim of the LOPSTR series  is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
 LOPSTR 2023 will be held in-person at Hotel Cascais Miragem  in Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal and will be co-located with PPDP 2023 as part of SPLASH 2023. At least one of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel is available on the SPLASH 2023 website  .  
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
  transformation 
  specialization 
  inversion 
  composition 
  optimisation 
  specification 
  analysis and verification

 Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
  Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
    
 References do NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings.  
 Submissions of Regular Papers  must describe the original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).  
 Submissions of Short Papers  may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research and tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool.  
  
 All accepted papers  will be included  in the conference proceedings  and published  by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  volume.  
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication  in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  . Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the standard reviewing process of the journal.  

 Submission Guidelines  
   
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's authors' instructions at the author's page  , and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX  (available also in overleaf  ) or for Word  , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form  . The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
  \usepackage{lineno}  
  \linenumbers  
   Papers should be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2023   

 Best Paper Award  
   
 Thanks to Springer's sponsorship, two best paper awards (one for each submission category) will be given at LOPSTR 2023. The program committee will select the winning papers based on relevance, originality and technical quality but may also take authorship into account (e.g. a student paper).

 Title  : Unification Modulo Equational Theories in Languages with Binding Operators 
 Abtract  : Unification (i.e., solving equations between terms) is a key step in the implementation of logic programming languages and theorem provers and is also used in type inference algorithms for functional languages and as a mechanism to analyse rewrite-based specifications (e.g., to find critical pairs). Matching is a version of unification in which only one of the terms in the equation can be instantiated.  
  Often, operators satisfy equational axioms (e.g., associativity commutativity), which must be taken into account during the unification or matching process. In addition, when the expressions to be unified involve binding operators (as is the case when representing programs, logics, computation models, etc.), unification and matching algorithms must take into account the alpha-equivalence relation generated by the binders.  
  In this talk, we present matching and unification algorithms for languages that include binding operators as well as operators that satisfy equational axioms, such as associativity and commutativity.

 Title  : On-The-Fly Verification via Incremental, Interactive Abstract Interpretation with CiaoPP and VeriFly 
 Abtract  : Ciao Prolog pioneered the idea of being able to optionally and gradually add assertions or contracts to programs in order to offer formal guarantees, a now very popular solution for solving the classic trade-offs between dynamic and static languages. This approach is enabled by Ciao’s program analysis and verification framework, CiaoPP, which performs abstract interpretation-based context- and path-sensitive analysis to infer information against which assertions are checked to achieve verification or flag errors statically. The framework supports multiple other languages in addition to Prolog, from machine code to smart contracts, by translation into Horn clauses. Program semantics is computed over different user-definable abstract domains, via efficient fixpoint computation. This allows inference and verification of both functional and non-functional properties, including, e.g., energy or ’gas’ consumption.  
  While this type of verification can be performed offline (e.g., as part of con- tinuous integration) it is very useful when it occurs interactively during software development, flagging errors as the program is written. However, while context- and path-sensitive global analysis over complex domains can provide the preci- sion needed for effective verification and optimization, it can also be expensive when applied to large code bases, sometimes making interactive use impracti- cal. On the other hand, in many program development situations modifications are small and isolated within a few components. The modular and incremental fixpoint algorithms used by CiaoPP take advantage of this to reuse as much as possible previous analysis results, reducing response times in interactive use.  
  In this talk we will review these ideas and show how the integration of the Ciao abstract interpretation framework within different IDEs takes advantage of our efficient and incremental fixpoint to achieve effective verification on-the-fly as the program is developed. We also demonstrate a number of embeddings of this framework within the browser, and show as an example an application for building interactive tutorials, which we have used for teaching verification and abstract interpretation.

 Overview  
   
 The aim of the LOPSTR series  is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
 LOPSTR 2023 will be held in-person at Hotel Cascais Miragem  in Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal and will be co-located with PPDP 2023 as part of SPLASH 2023. At least one of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel is available on the SPLASH 2023 website  .  
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
  transformation 
  specialization 
  inversion 
  composition 
  optimisation 
  specification 
  analysis and verification 
    
 testing and certification 
  program and model manipulation 
  AI-methods for program development 
  verification and testing of AI-based systems 
  transformational techniques in software engineering 
  logic-based methods for security, cyber-physical and distributed system 
  applications, tools and industrial practice 

 Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial applications and case studies are also welcome.  

 PAPER SUBMISSION  
   
 Submissions can be made in two categories:  
 Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
  Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
    
 References do NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings.  
 Submissions of Regular Papers  must describe the original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).  
 Submissions of Short Papers  may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research and tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool.  
  
 All accepted papers  will be included  in the conference proceedings  and published  by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  volume.  
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication  in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  . Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the standard reviewing process of the journal.  

 Submission Guidelines  
   
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's authors' instructions at the author's page  , and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX  (available also in overleaf  ) or for Word  , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form  . The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
  \usepackage{lineno}  
  \linenumbers  
   Papers should be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2023   

 Best Paper Award  
   
 Thanks to Springer's sponsorship, two best paper awards (one for each submission category) will be given at LOPSTR 2023. The program committee will select the winning papers based on relevance, originality and technical quality but may also take authorship into account (e.g. a student paper).

  Hình thức thi nào phù hợp với tôi? 
  Thi IELTS trên giấy 

 Thi IELTS trên giấy  
 Thi IELTS trên giấy với lịch thi từ 3-5 lần/tháng, giúp bạn thoải mái chọn ngày thi phù hợp. Thí sinh làm bài thi Nghe, Đọc và Viết trên giấy và thi Nói trực tiếp với giám khảo.  
 Đăng ký thi ngay      

  Bạn có thể làm bài thi IELTS trên giấy cho hai hình thức IELTS Học thuật và IELTS Tổng quát . Cấu trúc, nội dung, thời gian các phần thi, loại câu hỏi, cách tính điểm và tiêu chí chấm điểm bài thi trên giấy giống như bài thi IELTS trên máy tính  , nhưng trải nghiệm ngày thi của bạn có một số điểm khác biệt. Giám thị của kỳ thi sẽ phát đề thi và giấy làm bài cho bạn trước mỗi phần thi và sau đó sẽ thu lại trước khi chuyển sang phần thi tiếp theo.  
  
 Nếu bạn thi IELTS trên giấy, bạn sẽ hoàn thành các phần Nghe, Đọc và Viết trên giấy và phần Nói sẽ thực hiện trực tiếp với giám khảo. Bạn có thể sử dụng bút chì do trung tâm khảo thí cung cấp để hoàn thành bài thi Nghe, Đọc và Viết trên giấy làm bài. Trong bài thi IELTS trên giấy, các bài thi Nghe, Đọc và Viết đều được hoàn thành trong cùng một ngày mà không có giờ nghỉ giữa mỗi phần. Bài thi Nói được hoàn thành trong một cuộc phỏng vấn trực tiếp với giám khảo IELTS và có thể được diễn ra tối đa một tuần trước hoặc sau ngày thi của bạn.  
 Lưu ý: Với hình thức thi trên giấy, không có tính năng thi lại 1 kỹ năng bất kỳ (OSR) và bạn sẽ không có cơ hội tối ưu điểm số của mình, vì vậy bạn nên cân nhắc thi trên máy và tìm hiểu thêm về   OSR tại đây  .

   Bài thi thử IELTS Học thuật và Tổng quát miễn phí    

   Tôi có thể mang theo bút và giấy riêng của mình khi làm bài thi IELTS không?     Đối với bài thi IELTS trên giấy cũng như trên máy tính, bạn sẽ không thể mang giấy của mình khi làm bài thi vì lý do bảo mật. Trung tâm thi sẽ cung cấp bút chì và giấy làm bài trong phòng thi. Trong bài thi Nói, bạn cũng sẽ được cung cấp giấy nháp để chuẩn bị ý cho một phần của bài thi Nói.   

   Nếu tôi thi IELTS trên giấy, tôi có thể viết ghi chú vào tờ đề thi không?     Có, chúng tôi khuyến khích bạn viết ghi chú vào tờ đề thi. Giám khảo IELTS không được xem tờ đề thi của bạn.   

   Tôi có phải sử dụng bút chì cho bài thi IELTS trên giấy không?     Bút chì được khuyến nghị sử dụng cho các bài thi Nghe, Đọc và Viết IELTS. Điều này là do các bài thi sẽ được quét vào hệ thống và sẽ được nhận diện tốt nhất khi được viết bằng bút chì.   

   Thứ tự mà tôi sẽ hoàn thành bài thi IELTS như thế nào?     Nếu bạn thi IELTS trên máy tính, bạn sẽ thực hiện các phần thi theo thứ tự sau đây trong cùng ngày: Nghe, Đọc và Viết, với bài thi Nói thì có thể trước hoặc sau buổi thi này.  
  Nếu bạn làm bài thi IELTS trên giấy, bạn sẽ làm các phần thi theo thứ tự sau: Nghe, Đọc và Viết. Tùy thuộc vào trung tâm khảo thí, bài thi Nói có thể được thực hiện trong cùng ngày, hoặc tối đa 7 ngày trước hoặc sau ngày thi.   

   Sau 13 ngày, tôi vẫn chưa nhận được kết quả thi. Tôi nên làm gì?     Bạn sẽ nhận được kết quả thi ngay khi Trung tâm thi được phép, thông thường là khoảng 2 ngày sau ngày thi IELTS trên máy và 13 ngày sau ngày thi IELTS trên giấy. Một số Trung tâm thi sẽ thông báo thí sinh đến trực tiếp văn phòng IDP để nhận bảng điểm, vì vậy chúng tôi khuyến khích thí sinh nên liên hệ với trung tâm thi trước ngày có kết quả để kiểm tra cách nhận kết quả thi. Nếu bạn vẫn đang chờ kết quả thi, chúng tôi khuyến khích bạn liên hệ Trung tâm thi của bạn. Trong một số tình huống, kết quả thi IELTS có thể được trả trễ hơn do các lý do liên quan đến an ninh và tính nhất quán của kỳ thi. Nếu kỳ thi có các quan ngại về bài thi của bạn và có khả năng gian lận trong kỳ thi đã xãy ra, bạn sẽ nhận thông tin bài thi của bạn được tạm giữ để kiểm tra. Trong các trường hợp đặc biệt, bạn có thể sẽ được yêu cầu thi lại một hoặc nhiều phần của bài thi IELTS.    

   Sự khác biệt giữa IELTS trên giấy và trên máy tính là gì?     Nếu bạn chọn thi IELTS trên máy tính, bạn sẽ thực hiện phần thi Nghe, Đọc và Viết bằng máy tính.  
  Nếu bạn chọn thi IELTS trên giấy, bạn sẽ hoàn thành phần thi Nghe, Đọc và Viết trên giấy.  
  Cấu trúc bài thi giữa hai hình thức thi này hoàn toàn giống nhau. Nếu bạn thi trên máy tính, 3 kỹ năng Nghe đọc viết sẽ thực hiện trên máy và thi nói vẫn giữ nguyên hình thức Hỏi đáp trực tiếp cùng giám khảo. Kết quả thi trên máy tính sẽ có nhanh hơn, chỉ sau khoảng 2 ngày và bạn sẽ có nhiều lựa chọn về ngày thi hơn.   

   Các bài thi IELTS có lệ phí bao nhiêu?     Lệ phí thi IELTS Học thuật và IELTS Tổng quát là như nhau. Bạn có thể liên hệ với trung tâm khảo thí gần nhất để biết lệ phí thi cho quốc gia của bạn và bằng nội tệ của bạn. Lệ phí ước tính của bài thi là 4.664.000 VNĐ. Xem chi tiết tại: Lệ phí thi IELTS và hướng dẫn thanh toán    

   Lệ phí cho bài thi IELTS học thuật cho UKVI là bao nhiêu?     Lệ phí cho bài thi IELTS học thuật cho UKVI là 5.252.000 VNĐ. Xem hệ thống đăng ký thi IELTS  để biết lệ phí thi chính xác.

   Bài thi IELTS trên máy tính có dễ hơn trên giấy không?     Định dạng bài thi, loại câu hỏi, thời gian phân bổ cho mỗi phần và nội dung đều giống nhau cho cả bài thi trên máy tính và trên giấy.  
  Và vì nội dung của cả bài thi IELTS trên giấy và trên máy tính đều giống nhau, nên độ khó cũng như mhau. Sự khác biệt duy nhất có thể là mức độ tự tin của bạn khi thi IELTS trên máy tính. Nếu bạn am hiểu về công nghệ, bạn có thể cân nhắc thi IELTS trên máy tính.

 17th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning    

 October 11-14, 2024 - Dallas, Texas, USA    

 LPNMR 202  4  is the s  even  teenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications.   
 LPNMR 2024 is co-located with the  International Conference on Logic Programming   (ICLP) 2024.   
 A Doctoral Consortium  ,   in collaboration with ICLP,  will also be a part of the program.

 Deductive Systems for Logic Programs with Counting: Preliminary Report  
  Abstract   
 In answer set programming, two groups of rules are considered strongly equivalent if they have the same meaning in any context. Strong equivalence of two programs can be sometimes established by deriving rules of each program from rules of the other in an appropriate deductive system. This paper shows how to extend this method of proving strong equivalence to programs containing the counting aggregate.

 Compiling Metric Temporal Answer Set Programming  
  Abstract   
 We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP’s grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

 A Sequent Calculus for Generalized Inductive Definitions  
  Abstract   
 Inductive definitions are ubiquitous in mathematics and computer science, and play an important role in knowledge representation. To date, several proof systems have been developed for inductive definitions. However, these systems are typically limited to stratified definitions, while many important definitions are not stratified. Inspired by logic programming, the logic FO(ID) has been developed as an extension of classical first-order logic with general inductive definitions that go beyond stratification. This paper presents a classical sequent calculus LFO(ID) for FO(ID), based on the sequent calculus LKID by Brotherston and Simpson, which formalizes the principle of mathematical induction. While syntactically remaining close to LKID, LFO(ID) covers a substantially larger class of inductive definitions. The soundness of LFO(ID) is proven, thereby showing that a relatively conservative adaptation of LKID is capable of handling the liberal forms of definitions in FO(ID), governed by the intricate well-founded semantics.

 tExplain: Information Extraction with Explanations  
  Abstract   
 We present a narrative understanding tool that takes as an input a narrative in natural English language that contains both sentences describing actions as well as questions and outputs answers to those questions together with natural language explanations justifying those answers. We evaluate our tool on the several tasks of Facebook’s bAbI challenge where it achieves 100% accuracy.

 ASP-Based Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search for Course Timetabling  
  Abstract   
 We develop an approach to solve curriculum-based course timetabling (CB-CTT) problems with Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search (LNPS) based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). LNPS is a metaheuristic that starts with an initial solution and then iteratively tries to obtain improved solutions by alternately destroying and prioritized searching for a current solution. Our approach relies on high-level domain-specific LNPS configurations for efficient CB-CTT solving, and both the grounding and solving tasks are delegated to a heuristically-driven answer set optimizer implementing the LNPS algorithm. The resulting system teaspoon-lnps  demonstrates that LNPS can significantly enhance the solving performance of ASP for CB-CTT solving. Furthermore, we show the competitiveness of our declarative approach by empirically contrasting it to the best known bounds obtained by more dedicated algorithms.

 Towards Industrial-Scale Product Configuration  
  Abstract   
 We address the challenge of product configuration in the context of increasing customer demand for diverse and complex products. We propose a solution through a curated selection of product model benchmarks formulated in the Coom  language, divided into three fragments of increasing complexity. Each fragment is accompanied by a corresponding bike model example, and additional scalable product models are included in the CoomSuite  , along with relevant resources. We outline an ASP-based workflow for solving Coom  -based configuration problems, highlighting its adaptability to different paradigms and alternative ASP solutions. The CoomSuite  aims to provide a comprehensive, accessible, and representative set of examples that can serve as a common ground for stakeholders in the field of product configuration.

 An ILASP-Based Approach to Repair Petri Nets  
  Abstract   
 Petri nets are a class of models of computation used to compactly represent discrete event systems. Among many application domains, they have now become the most prominent formalism to express process models in Process Mining, thanks to their formal semantics that enables automated analysis techniques. In this context, model repair  is the task of aligning a process model with actual executions of the process. Current solutions to model repair do not allow for embedding domain knowledge, providing guarantees of rigor, and enforcing structural requirements at the same time. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on the Inductive Logic Programming system ILASP. We then implement our approach and perform an experimental evaluation, showing both its expressiveness and feasibility.

 Abstract Dialectical Frameworks are Boolean Networks  
  Abstract   
 Abstract dialectical frameworks are a unifying model of formal argumentation, where argumentative relations between arguments are represented by assigning acceptance conditions to atomic arguments. Their generality allows them to cover a number of different approaches with varying forms of representing the argumentation structure. Boolean regulatory networks are used to model the dynamics of complex biological processes, taking into account the interactions of biological compounds, such as proteins or genes. These models have proven highly useful for comprehending such biological processes, allowing to reproduce known behaviour and testing new hypotheses and predictions in silico  , for example in the context of new medical treatments. While both these approaches stem from entirely different communities, it turns out that there are striking similarities in their appearence. In this paper, we study the relation between these two formalisms revealing their communalities as well as their differences, and introducing a correspondence that allows to establish novel results for the individual formalisms.

 Using Learning from Answer Sets for Robust Question Answering with LLM  
  Abstract   
 Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the ability for commonsense reasoning and learning from text. In this work, we present a system, called LLM2LAS, for learning commonsense knowledge from story-based question and answering expressed in natural language. LLM2LAS combines the semantic parsing capability of LLMs with ILASP for learning commonsense knowledge expressed as answer set programs. LLM2LAS requires only few examples of questions and answers to learn general commonsense knowledge and correctly answer unseen questions. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the viability of our approach.

 Multi-paradigm Logic Programming in the rgoAI System  
  Abstract   
 \(\mathcal{E}\)  rgoAI (abbr. \(\mathcal{E}\)  rgo) is a high level, multi-paradigm logic programming language and system developed by Coherent Knowledge Systems as an enhancement of and a successor to the popular \(\mathcal{{F}}lora{\text {-}}\)  2  system. \(\mathcal{E}\)  rgo is oriented towards scalable knowledge representation and reasoning, and can exploit both structured knowledge as well as knowledge derived from external sources such as vector embeddings. From the start, \(\mathcal{E}\)  rgo (and \(\mathcal{{F}}lora{\text {-}}\)  2  before it) were designed to exploit the well-founded semantics for reasoning in a multi-paradigm environment, including object-based  logic (F-logic) with non-monotonic inheritance; higher order  syntax in the style of HiLog; defeasibility  of rules; semantically clean transactional updates  ; and extensive use of subgoal delay  for better logical behavior and performance. Although \(\mathcal{E}\)  rgo programs are compiled into XSB and adopt many Prolog features, \(\mathcal{E}\)  rgo is altogether a different language with functionality equivalent to major Prologs.

 An ASP-Based Approach to Water Distribution System Reconstruction  
  Abstract   
 Hydraulic engineering analysis of Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) is performed by running simulation softwares. The starting point to setup a simulation is to reconstruct the WDS topology. In many countries, including Italy, it often happens that data on the WDS is not readily available and accessible in digital format, and topology-reconstruction has to be carried out manually. This paper describes an application of Answer Set Programming to partially automate the task of determining a WDS topology from geospatial data. Also, we report on a real-world use case that shows the feasibility of our approach.

 Consequence Operators of Characterization Logics – The Case of Abstract Argumentation  
  Abstract   
 The analysis of properties of consequence operators has been a very active field in the formative years of non-monotonic reasoning. One possible approach to do this is to start with a model-theoretic semantics and then to study the logical consequence relation induced by that semantics. In this paper we follow that approach and analyse resulting consequence operators of so-called characterization logics. Roughly speaking, a characterization logic characterizes, via its own notion of ordinary equivalence, another logic’s notion of strong equivalence  . For example, the logic of here and there is a characterization logic for answer set programs, because strong equivalence of the latter is characterized by ordinary equivalence of the former.   
 In previous work, we showed that the consideration of finite knowledge bases only – a common assumption in the field of knowledge representation – guarantees the existence (and uniqueness) of characterization logics. In this paper, we apply this existence result to the field of abstract argumentation. We show that the associated consequence operator outputs a so-called reverse kernel, a useful construct that received comparably little attention in the literature so far. As an aside, we clarify that for several well-known logics, their canonical characterization consequence operators are well-behaved.

 Efficiently Grounding FOL Using Bit Vectors  
  Abstract   
 Several paradigms for declarative problem solving start from a specification in a high-level language, which is then transformed to a low-level language, such as SAT or SMT. Often, this transformation includes a “grounding” step to remove first-order quantification. To reduce the time and size of the grounding, it can be useful to simplify formulas along the way, e.g., by taking into account the interpretation of symbols that are already known. In this paper, we investigate the use of bit vectors to efficiently simplify formulas, thereby taking advantage of the fact that, on modern hardware, logical operations on bit vectors can be executed extremely fast. We conduct an experimental analysis, which shows that bit vectors are indeed fast for certain problems, but also have limitations.

 Integrating MiniZinc with ASP Chef: Browser-Based Constraint Programming for Education and Prototyping  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we present the integration of MiniZinc into ASP Chef, expanding its capabilities to include constraint programming alongside Answer Set Programming (ASP). By leveraging the web assembly version of MiniZinc, this integration allows for running MiniZinc models directly in the browser, eliminating the need for additional software installations. This browser-based approach is particularly advantageous for educational settings and rapid prototyping, offering a seamless and accessible environment for learners and practitioners. To facilitate the incorporation of MiniZinc in ASP recipes, we have implemented a mapping mechanism that converts facts to MiniZinc data and vice versa. This integration not only broadens the scope of problems that can be addressed using ASP Chef but also simplifies the workflow for users, making it a versatile tool for complex computational tasks.

 Answer Set Explanations via Preferred Unit-Provable Unsatisfiable Subsets  
  Abstract   
 Explainability in Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is crucial for enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems. Our work focuses on providing clear explanations for why certain atoms in a given answer set are evaluated as such, hence contributing to the understanding of the decisions made by Answer Set Programming (ASP) systems. We employ simple inference rules to elucidate these decisions, avoiding complex derivations to maintain clarity. Moreover, we introduce the notion of preferred unit-provable unsatisfiable subsets (preferred 1–PUS) to identify relevant portions of ASP encodings, prioritizing program rules over assignments, with the objective of minimizing the assumptions involved in the explanation process. The proposed principles are implemented in a new XAI system.

 Towards Mass Spectrum Analysis with ASP  
  Abstract   
 We present a new use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to discover the molecular structure of chemical samples based on the relative abundance of elements and structural fragments, as measured in mass spectrometry. To constrain the exponential search space for this combinatorial problem, we develop canonical representations of molecular structures and an ASP implementation that uses these definitions. We evaluate the correctness of our implementation over a large set of known molecular structures, and we compare its quality and performance to other ASP symmetry-breaking methods and to a commercial tool from analytical chemistry.

 Monitoring and Scheduling of Semiconductor Failure Analysis Labs  
  Abstract   
 Finding non-conformities, such as physical failures causing electrical malfunctioning of a device, in modern semiconductor devices is challenging. Highly qualified employees in a failure analysis (FA) lab typically use sophisticated and expensive tools like scanning electron microscopes to identify and locate such non-conformities. Given the increasing complexity of investigated devices and very limited resources, labs may struggle to deliver analysis results in time.   
 This paper proposes an approach to optimize the usage of FA lab resources by combining constraint programming with stream reasoning enabling situation-dependent monitoring of the lab’s conditions and schedule maintenance. Evaluation results indicate that our system can significantly improve the tardiness of real-world FA labs, and all its computational tasks can be finished in an average time of 3.6 s, with a maximum of 15.2 s, which is acceptable for the lab’s workflows.

 A Semantical Approach to Abstraction in Answer Set Programming and Assumption-Based Argumentation  
  Abstract   
 Recently forms of abstraction have been proposed for both logic programs (LPs) under the answer set semantics (ASP) and for the related formalism of assumption-based argumentation (ABA), e.g., via clustering of atoms or assumptions, in order to simplify a given LP or ABA framework. In both approaches after clustering the original answer sets and assumption sets are over-approximated, with the aim of avoiding spuriousness. In contrast, in ASP a given LP is syntactically modified to achieve over-approximation, while on ABA the framework is minimally modified and the semantics is abstracted. In this work we follow the latter approach and provide a novel semantical abstraction for LPs and for ABA frameworks corresponding to LPs.

 On Forgetting in Assumption-Based Argumentation  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we investigate forgetting notions in general, possibly non-flat assumption-based argumentation (ABA) frameworks. Research on forgetting is driven by desiderata the operators should adhere to. We consider two forgetting desiderata, called persistence  and elimination  and study under which ABA semantics they can be satisfied. Striving to keep our study as generic as possible, we derive our results in an abstract argumentation formalism called bipolar SETAFs  (BSAFs) which capture non-flat ABA. Thereby, we consider different sub-classes which results in a broad study of the matter. Due to the close correspondence between ABA and BSAFs, we can transfer our findings to non-flat ABA. Our investigation reveals that in most cases, persistence cannot be satisfied by any forgetting operator, while elimination can be achieved most of the time.

 Towards Explainable Weather Forecasting Through FastLAS  
  Abstract   
 Weather forecasting is important for saving lives, protecting property, and supporting economic activities. It provides timely warnings for severe weather, improves agricultural planning, and aids in disaster management. Neural networks and deep learning methods can achieve impressive accuracy in weather prediction, but their black-box nature lacks in explainability. To address this limitation, we investigated the potential of FastLAS, an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) framework, to produce reliable and, more important, explainable weather predictions. FastLAS learns ASP programs whose syntax and structural semantics resemble natural human language, making them easily understandable and interpretable by humans. The supportedness of stable models allows a clear explanation of the predictions. Our empirical evaluation on data from an Italian weather forecasting center shows that our approach is capable of learning predictive models from small dataset (a few samples instead of the thousands needed by neural networks) achieving an accuracy higher than statistical machine learning base lines.

 Semantic-Based Arguments Using Logic Programming Rewriting Systems  
  Abstract   
 Traditionally, in the argumentation theory literature structured arguments  are constructed from rules interpretations aiming to build well-supported deductive evidence. Different from other approaches, we emphasize the role of investigating general frameworks that can also provide a consistent and well-defined justification for a conclusion that cannot be inferred  and there is certainty  about it, which we call here NAF-arguments  , which have been less explored in the formal argumentation theory, despite its potential use in practical applications for building nuanced well-structured explanations and justifications.   
 This article introduces the so-called semantic argumentation  guaranteeing well-known principles for quality in structured argumentation, and with the ability to generate two types of arguments, those where the conclusion  atoms are semantically interpreted as true  , and those where the conclusion is assumed to be false  , we call them here semantic  and NAF-arguments  respectively. This framework is defined on the set of all logic programs in terms of rewriting systems  based on a confluent set  of transformation rules  , the so-called Confluent Logic Programming Systems  , making this approach a general framework. Additionally, we introduce a method for building such arguments using the program’s strata  through partial interpretations. We implement our framework named semantic argumentation solver  available open source.

 Modelling Dialogues in a Concurrent Language for Argumentation  
  Abstract   
 In the fast-growing area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the ability of autonomous agents to engage in complex debates is crucial for consensus building on beliefs, actions, or goals and forms the basis for applications in decision-making, planning, opinion polling, and negotiation. In this paper, we leverage the Timed Concurrent Language for Argumentation, a modelling language derived from concurrent programming paradigms and Argumentation Theory, to introduce well-known high-level propositions (claim, counter, why, argue, concede, and retract) to model various debate forms, making it a powerful tool for agent interaction. The obtained constructs, specifically designed for multi-agent reasoning and the facilitation of argumentation, define the dialogue language DICLA   (DIalogic Concurrent Language for Argumentation) that enables domain experts to employ advanced computational argumentation tools without needing programming skills, bridging the gap between theoretical argumentation models and practical, real-world applications.

 A Fixpoint Characterisation of Temporal Equilibrium Logic  
  Abstract   
 Connections of intuitionistic and intermediate logics with logic programming have been extensively studied in the literature. Among the different results in the literature we find equilibrium logic (Pearce, 1996) and Safe beliefs (Osorio et al., 2005). Pearce’s approach admits a characterisation in terms of a fixpoint (consequence) operator on the here-and-there intermediate logic (Heyting, 1930), which is similar to the notion of theory completion  in default and autoepistemic logics. Osorio’s safe beliefs are also given in terms of a fixpoint operator under intuitionistic logic semantics. In this latter case, intuitionistic logic can be replaced by any intermediate logic without altering the result.   
 In this paper we consider temporal equilibrium logic, an combination of equilibrium logic and linear-time temporal logic. In this context we extend Pearce’s and Osorio’s approach to temporal case and we discuss the relation of intuitionistic temporal logic and temporal logic programming.

 A Category-Theoretic Perspective on Higher-Order Approximation Fixpoint Theory  
  Abstract   
 Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is an algebraic framework designed to study the semantics of non-monotonic logics. Despite its success, AFT is not readily applicable to higher-order definitions. To solve such an issue, we devise a formal mathematical framework employing concepts drawn from Category Theory. In particular, we make use of the notion of Cartesian closed category to inductively construct higher-order approximation spaces while preserving the structures necessary for the correct application of AFT. We show that this novel theoretical approach extends standard AFT to a higher-order environment, and generalizes the AFT setting of [ 7  ].

 A Simulation for Supply Chains Contract Execution  
  Abstract   
 Supply chains exhibit complex dynamics and intricate dependencies among their components, whose understanding is crucial for addressing the challenges highlighted by recent global disruptions. This paper presents a novel multi-agent system designed to simulate supply chains, linking reasoning about dynamic domains and multi-agent systems to reasoning about the high-level primitives of the NIST CPS Framework. Our approach synthesizes existing research on supply chain formalization and integrates these insights with multi-agent techniques, employing a declarative approach to model interactions and dependencies. The simulation framework models a set of autonomous agents within a partially observable environment, and whose interactions are dictated by contracts. The system dynamically reconciles agents’ actions, assessing their feasibility and consequences. Based on the state of the domain, the simulation framework also draws conclusions about the high-level notions of requirements and concerns of the NIST CPS Framework, which provide a uniform and domain-agnostic vocabulary for the understanding of such complex systems as supply chains.

 Reasoning and Explanation Generation in Ad Hoc Collaboration Between Humans and Embodied AI  
  Abstract   
 An assistive embodied AI agent often has to collaborate with previously unseen humans. State of the art frameworks for such ad hoc teamwork  use a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agents and to determine the ad hoc (i.e., embodied AI) agent’s behavior. These approaches do not support rapid incremental revisions or transparency, and the necessary resources (e.g., training examples, computation) are not readily available in practical domains. Our previous work introduced an architecture that enabled an ad hoc agent to choose its actions in simple simulated domains based on non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior domain knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. Here, we extend this architecture to enable an ad hoc embodied AI agent to collaborate with a human performing household tasks in a complex indoor environment, focusing on the ad hoc agent’s ability to identify and reason with relevant knowledge, and provide relational descriptions as explanations of its behavior and that of the human. We evaluate our architecture’s capabilities in VirtualHome  , a realistic 3D simulation environment.

 Policies, Penalties, and Autonomous Agents  
  Abstract   
 This paper introduces a framework for enabling policy-aware autonomous agents to reason about potential penalties for non-compliant behavior, and act accordingly. We employ the Authorization and Obligation Policy Language  ( \(\mathcal {AOPL}\)  ) for policy specification and Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning about policies and penalties. We build upon existing work by Harders and Inclezan on simulating the behavior of policy-aware autonomous agents and test our work on two different domains. We conclude that our framework produces higher quality plans than the previous approach. Depending on the nature of the domain, optimal plans may also be computed more efficiently by our framework.

 LTLf2ASP: LTLf Bounded Satisfiability in ASP  
  Abstract   
 Finite  variant of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL \(_\text {f}\)  ) is increasingly popular in Artificial Intelligence (AI).Indeed, several AI applications rely on checking the satisfiability of temporal specifications expressed in LTL \(_\text {f}\)  (e.g., planning, and model-checking). This paper describes ltlf2asp  , an ASP-based system for bounded satisfiability checking of LTL \(_\text {f}\)  formulae. The approach is based on a natural encoding in ASP of temporal operators that is inspired to SAT-based approaches. Experiments show that our system compares favourably to the state-of-the-art, and shows the ASP technology stack is a suitable alternative to SAT/SMT solvers for bounded satisfiability checking of LTL \(_\text {f}\)  formulae.

 Integrating Structured Declarative Language (SDL) into ASP Chef  
  Abstract   
 This article explores the integration of Structured Declarative Language (SDL) into ASP Chef, a low-code web application designed to facilitate the development of pipelines for combinatorial search and optimization. SDL is a recent proposal aimed at simplifying the syntax of Answer Set Programming (ASP), inspired by the straightforwardness of SQL. The integration is achieved through the implementation of a server that compiles SDL specifications into ASP programs and the addition of a new operation in ASP Chef to manage data exchange with the server. This integration aims to streamline the development process and make it more accessible for users working on combinatorial optimization tasks.

 A Generalisation of Epistemic Splitting Property  
  Abstract   
 Answer-set programming  ( \(\textsf{ASP} \)  ) is a declarative logic programming paradigm that provides an efficient problem-solving approach in logic-based artificial intelligence ( \(\textsf{AI} \)  ). While it has proven successful, \(\textsf{ASP} \)  encounters specific situations where its language falls short of accurately representing and reasoning about incomplete information. Researchers now widely agree that \(\textsf{ASP} \)  requires powerful introspective reasoning with the use of epistemic modal operators; yet, despite long-lasting debates on how to extend \(\textsf{ASP} \)  with such operators, they cannot reach a consensus on satisfactory semantics. Cabalar et al. argue that such research should be grounded in formal robustness. Thus, inspired by \(\textsf{ASP} \)  ’s foundational properties, they introduce a structural principle called epistemic splitting  and designate it as one of the compulsory criteria for epistemic \(\textsf{ASP} \)  . This paper generalises their approach to a more comprehensive, meticulous, and conservative extension of \(\textsf{ASP} \)  - splitting  , thereby enhancing its applicability and efficiency.

 Best Paper Awards Guidelines  
 The goal of the best paper awards is to point out excellent research performed by researchers in the field of programming languages and systems. The EAPLS best paper award is available for conferences in the field of programming languages and systems.  It is   not restricted to European conferences only but the particular conference  edition must be hold in an European country.   The award consists of  a diploma and will be handed over to the winner by one of the EAPLS board members (if possible) at, for instance, the conference dinner.    

 The following requirements have to be fulfilled:    
 The proceedings should be published with LNCS, ACM or IEEE. 
  The number of participants should be at least 50. 
  The conference should have a clear link with programming languages and systems. 
  There should be a proper reviewing of the papers, at least 3 | reviews per paper. 
  The acceptance rate should be below 35%. 
  The conference mentions EAPLS explicitly as sponsor on the web page. 
  The conference venue should be in Europe. 
  The organising committee should contact the secretary and president at least six months before the actual conference date. 
  The criteria for selecting the best paper are: 
  if it is a standalone conference, the PC chairs should nominate 3 best papers accompanied with the referee reports and a motivating letter. 
  if it is an umbrella conference, the PC chairs of the individual conferences nominate 1 best paper again accompanied with the referee reports and a motivating letter. 
  both the secretary and president of EAPLS have to receive the nominated papers, reports and the motivation letter | two | months before the conference is held. This time is needed to review the papers and make the selection. If the conference organisation is not able to meet this schedule it makes no sense to apply for the best paper award.

 AIMS LATA is a conference series on theoretical computer science and its applications. LATA 2020 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their career. It will aim at attracting contributions from classical theory fields as well as application areas. SCOPE Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to: algebraic language theory algorithms for semi-structured data mining algorithms on automata and words automata and logic automata for system analysis and programme verification automata networks automatic structures codes combinatorics on words computational complexity concurrency and Petri nets data and image compression descriptional complexity foundations of finite state technology foundations of XML grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, unification, categorial, etc.) grammatical inference, inductive inference and algorithmic learning graphs and graph transformation language varieties and semigroups language-based cryptography mathematical and logical foundations of programming methodologies parallel and regulated rewriting parsing patterns power series string processing algorithms symbolic dynamics term rewriting transducers trees, tree languages and tree automata weighted automata  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2021-01-24

MABS 2024 - The 25th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation       Committees  Call for Papers  Accepted Papers  Registration  Program  MABS Series    

 The 2024 Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS) workshop is the 25th of the MABS series which began in 1998  . Its scientific focus lies in the confluence of social sciences and multi-agent systems, with a strong application/empirical vein, and its emphasis is stressed on (i) exploratory agent based simulation as a principled way of undertaking scientific research in the social sciences and (ii) using social theories as an inspiration to new frameworks and developments in multi-agent systems.  
 The excellent quality level of this workshop has been recognized since its inception and its proceedings have been regularly published in Springer’s Lecture Notes series. MABS 2024 will be hosted at AAMAS 2024 (23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems)  , which will take place at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in on May 6th to 10th, 2024.  
 MABS 2024 continues its tradition of fostering cross-fertilisation and innovation in MAS engineering and complex social and sociotechnical systems modeling. The workshop encourages submissions in areas such as simulation methodology and tools, simulation of social and intelligent behaviour, diverse applications, and simulation analytics.  
 Keynote Presentation  
 The MABS Committee is excited to announce this year’s keynote presentation from Professor Pascal Perez, Director of the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN). Pascal will take us through his experiences in urban systems and transport modeling, combining this with his new role in integrating large-scale urban data sources that form the backbone of AURIN’s offering to researchers and multi-agent modellers.

MABS 2024 - The 25th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation       Committees  Call for Papers  Accepted Papers  Registration  Program  MABS Series    

 We are excited to announce the Call for Papers for the 25th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS 2024), a pivotal event that brings together leading researchers from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) engineering and the social, economic, and organisational sciences.  
 MABS 2024 is part of the AAMAS 2024 conference taking place at The University of Auckland  in New Zealand on 6th-10th of May, 2024.  
 MABS 2024 continues its tradition of fostering cross-fertilisation and innovation in MAS engineering and complex social and sociotechnical systems modeling. The workshop encourages submissions in areas such as simulation methodology and tools, simulation of social and intelligent behaviour, diverse applications, and simulation analytics.  
 The MABS workshop has run alongside the main conference since AAMAS was first held in Bologna in 2002 and continues to attract a diverse and enthusiastic group of participants. This year’s focus will be on ‘Modelling and Simulation of Societies’, which aligns closely with one of the 10 themes of the main AAMAS conference.  
 For the MABS workshop, we encourage submission of work that is in a less finished state than we would expect to see at the main conference. We particularly encourage the submission of work that has open questions which would be worthy of discussion at the workshop.

The workshop will feature an invited speaker/s, paper presentations, and a concluding panel discussion. The workshop duration and presentation times will be contingent on the number of submissions.  
 Audience and Scope.  MABS 2024 welcomes social scientists, policy-makers, AI, MAS, and simulation researchers and developers. It’s an ideal platform for those engaged in modelling multi-agent systems and applying agent-based simulation in real-world scenarios.  
 Proceedings.  Post-proceedings will be reviewed further and published in the Springer LNAI series under “Multi-Agent-Based Simulation XXV, 25th International Workshop, Auckland, May 2024, Revised Papers”.  
 Target audience.  The workshop will provide a forum for social scientists, policy-makers, and AI, MAS and simulation researchers and developers, to assess the current state of the art in the agent-based modeling and simulation of social and socio-technical systems, to identify where and discuss how existing approaches can be successfully applied, to learn about new approaches and explore future research challenges, and to exchange ideas and knowledge in an interdisciplinary environment.  
 The workshop will be of interest to researchers engaged in modeling and analyzing multi-agent systems, and those interested in applying agent-based simulation techniques to real-world problems. In addition, it will attract researchers committed to cross-cutting research that is complementary to more orthodox modeling approaches.  
 MABS intends to be a place where researchers can exchange ideas about their work and we are looking forward to the community meeting once again in person.  
 Submission guidelines  
 Submissions are limited to 12 pages including references  formatted according to the Springer LNCS style  and must be electronically submitted before the submission deadline through the workshop conference system, which is available here:  
 Submission Link through Easychair   
 All contributions will be peer-reviewed by at least two independent PC members. The evaluation criteria of contributions will be based on originality, quality, clarity, and its relevance to the workshop.  
 Publication  
 Following the tradition of the previous MABS workshops, we intend to publish the accepted papers, after a further reviewing process, in the Springer Multi-Agent-Based Simulation book series, LNAI  .

 PAPER TYPES AND FORMATS  

 LREC-COLING 2024 invites high-quality submissions written in English. Submissions of three forms of papers will be considered:   
 Regular long papers | – up to eight (8) pages maximum*, presenting substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. 
  Short papers | – up to four (4) pages*, describing a small focused contribution, negative results, system demonstrations, etc. 
  Position papers | – up to eight (8) pages*, discussing key hot topics, challenges and open issues, as well as cross-fertilization between computational linguistics and other disciplines. 
  * Excluding any number of additional pages for references, ethical consideration, conflict-of-interest, as well as data, and code availability statements.   
   
 Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page – up to nine (9) pages of content plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references – so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Final versions of short papers may have up to five (5) pages, plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references. For both long and short papers, all figures and tables that are part of the main text must fit within these page limits.   
   
 Furthermore, appendices or supplementary material will also be allowed ONLY in the final, camera-ready version, but not during submission, as papers should be reviewed without the need to refer to any supplementary materials.   
   
 Linguistic examples, if any, should be presented in the original language but also glossed into English to allow accessibility for a broader audience.   
 Note that paper types are decisions made orthogonal to the eventual, final form of presentation (i.e., oral versus poster).   

 PAPER SUBMISSIONS AND TEMPLATES  

 Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link:   
 https://softconf.com/lrec-coling2024/papers/     
 Both long and short papers must follow the LREC-COLING 2024 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded from the Style Files and Formatting page provided on the website. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.  

 AUTHOR RESPONSIBILITIES  

 Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized  to support double-blind reviewing. Submissions thus must not include authors’ names and affiliations. The submissions should also avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub   or Anonym Share   ). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.  
 If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, LREC-COLING 2024 will follow the same policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.  
 More specifically, direct submissions to LREC-COLING 2024 may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after September 22, 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to submission time).  
 Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.  
 Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at LREC-COLING 2024, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at LREC-COLING 2024 is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the LREC-COLING 2024 committee must be notified immediately  

 ETHICS STATEMENT  

 We encourage all authors submitting to LREC-COLING 2024 to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of their work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).  

 PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT  

 All papers accepted to the main conference track must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings, and at least one author must register for LREC-COLING2024. Papers will be presented either orally or as posters. The specific presentation modality of a paper will be decided based on its content, with no difference in quality implied. Papers that include a demonstration component will be presented as posters.  
 All papers accepted to the main conference will be required to submit a presentation video. The conference will be hybrid, with an emphasis on encouraging interaction between the online and in-person modalities, and thus presentations can be either on-site or virtual.

 Research Areas  

 Foundations of Computer Science, Computational Life Sciences and Bioinformatics  
    
 The macro-area is composed of two main research areas that are transversal with respect to the methodological approach, attentive to the foundational aspects of research topics deriving from the computational sciences for life. The first area focuses on the study of theoretical and foundational aspects of computation, modeling, and simulation of complex systems and the development of innovative algorithmic methodologies: areas motivated by application contexts such as biology and physics that require the need to define computational foundations. In this context, there are two main specific objectives. The first focuses on the design and experimentation of exact, approximate, evolutionary algorithmic methodologies or machine learning aimed at processing large amounts of data in various application contexts, mainly related to the analysis and integration of biological data. The second objective focuses on the study of computational power and properties of computational models inspired by physical and biological laws, such as membrane systems (or P systems) and reaction systems, with the definition of associated complexity classes and comparison with classical models such as Turing machines and RAM machines, and on the extension and study of specific compositional properties of models, such as Petri nets. The application areas in this context include biology and various aspects of the simulation of complex systems under uncertain conditions, safety and control. The second area of research is in the computational sciences for life and addresses various algorithmic and computational aspects of genomics, transcriptomics and phylogenetics in Bioinformatics, simulation and modelling of processes in computational biology and specifically systems biology. The activities in this area are broad and complementary. The main lines of research active in the field of fundamentals are:  
 study of the algebraic structure and logical properties of space of local states of competing systems, 
  calculation models for the description of real phenomena and systems (in particular cellular automata), 
  Introduction into machine learning of aspects of uncertainty, such as soft clustering, generalized decision trees, inference on possibilistic databases, 
  study of the computational power and computational efficiency of membrane systems (P systems) and reaction systems, 
  algorithms and succinct data structures for indexing and querying large collections of strongly similar texts, 
  general-purpose computing with GPU. 
  In life sciences and bioinformatics, the main lines of active research are:  
 event prediction algorithms for splicing events from NGS data, NGS data assembly and algorithms for the reconstruction and comparison of phylogenetic trees with cancer genomics applications, 
  algorithms and models for inferencing the evolution of tumor mutations from large quays of single-cell or bulk sequencing data, 
  deterministic and stochastic simulation algorithms for biological systems, 
  mechanistic and constraint-based models of biological systems, 
  machine learning and deep learning for the classification of tumor subtypes. 
  Recently is active in the development of algorithms in Fundamentals a new direction of research on Information Security mainly focused on the development and implementation of algorithms and cryptographic protocols.  

 Software Engineering and Architecture  
    
 The area deals with various research topics related to the development of software systems, with particular attention to design, quality control, and maintenance and evolution of software systems. The research activity on software design mainly concerns with the definition, development and testing of new architectural models and appropriate methodologies and tools to address emerging application domains. The research activity on software quality mainly concerns with the definition of methods for the validation and verification of software systems, the definition of testing techniques, the dynamic and static analysis of programs and the realization of self-healing systems. Finally, the research activity on software systems maintenance mainly concerns with the definition, development, and validation of reverse engineering techniques and tools for software comprehension, maintenance and technical debt management. The research activity carried out in this area is wide and varied, the main lines of research in progress are:  
 the definition and experimentation of architectural solutions for multimodal systems, 
  the definition and experimentation of self-healing and runtime enforcement techniques for Mobile and Cloud environments, 
  the definition of techniques for software monitoring, recognition and prediction of failures, and automatic repair of faults, particularly in Cloud and Mobile environments, 
  automatic generation of unit and system test cases using symbolic, search-based and machine learning techniques, 
  the development of techniques to identify and quantify the technical debt level of a software project and avoid the degradation of the software architecture, 
  the study of machine learning techniques for the recognition of code and design anomalies and the definition of the corresponding refactoring techniques to solve them, 
  the development of tools to support the modernization of legacy systems architecture towards microservice architecture. 

 Web and Information Systems  
    
 The research activities carried out in this macro-area relate to Data Science, and are aimed at developing models and techniques to support the processes of management and analysis of various types of data. In particular, multiple aspects related to the data life cycle are considered, including acquisition, transformation, organization, different types of analysis, knowledge extraction, and interaction with users.  
 Two main lines of research can be distinguished: the first includes Information Retrieval, Text Mining, and social media analysis, while the second includes the intersection of contiguous and complementary disciplines such as Human-Machine Interaction, Information Systems, Distributed Systems, and Data Semantics. In the first research area, the main interests relate to the definition of models, techniques, and systems aimed at guaranteeing personalized access to information on the Web, the analysis and conceptual representation of texts, the extraction of information from texts (text mining), the analysis of the evolution of information, and the predictive analysis of user-generated content in social media. In the second research line, problems concerning three macro-themes are addressed, often jointly: a) human-machine interaction, with particular attention to human interaction with artifacts, graphic interface design, and data visualization; b) semantic interoperability between systems for data, knowledge and services management, with particular attention to the implementation of open, adaptive and distributed applications in the Cloud through service architectures, semantic integration, and quality analysis; c) value in information systems, with particular attention to the value of information and services. The most active lines of research at this time, include:  
 Information Retrieval Area:  
 Definition of models and systems for personalized search and recommendation of information in various application contexts. 
  Definition of models for the semantic representation of texts and for the analysis of the evolution of knowledge over time on social media. 
  Definition of user models based on natural language analysis. 
  Analysis of information generated by users in social media 
  Area Human-Machine Interaction and Distributed and Semantic Information Systems:  
 Design, Analysis, Development and Usability Assessment of visual interactive systems for the exploration and analysis of large amounts of data. 
  Semantic enrichment techniques of structured data to support Data Science applications. 
  API composition techniques based on semantic descriptions. 
  Profiling models, quality and value of data and services. 

 Intelligent sensing (Robotics, Real-Time Systems and Computer Vision)  
    
 The activity in this area focuses on foundational and industrial research topics covering 1) diverse aspects of the analysis and management of mutimedia and sensorial data of several kinds, 2) robotics, and 3) real-time intelligent sensing. The research activities on topic 1) focuses on the development of algorithms and techniques for analysing and managing digital signals, with special interest on multimedia signals (audio, images, and video), fisiological signals (EEG (electroencefalogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), skin galvanic responses, blood pressure, temperature), and psychofisical signals (eye tracker).  
 Moreover, it designs and develops novel methods for Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Multimedia, applied to diverse types of data with a specialization on managing images, video, and data from multimodal sensors. The research activity on robotics focuses on systems for world-perception by autonomous robots, in particular mapping the working environment, localization, and scene understanding and tracking. The research on real-time systems is developed over conceptual and computational instruments for understanding and controlling complex systems which evolve with time, passing through a series of macroscopic states, each of which is characterised by a specific set of rules which depend on data collected at real-time.  
 The main active research topics are:  
 processing, analysis, and classification of multimedia signals in the realm of affective signal processing and analysis of social networks; 
  integration of fisiological multimodal data for classification of cognitive and emotive states, or identifying potential pathologies (for example, prosopagnosia; the incapacity of recognising faces) or age-related diseases; 
  Internet of Things and Autonomous Driving; 
  cross-media execution in robotics; for example, localization with cameras in LIDAR-constructed maps; 
  Wearable Expery System Development, integration between knowledge-based systems and wearable technologies for constructing recommender systems in time-dependent domains; 
  use of machine learning techniques, in particular case-based reasoning, for the analysis and support of decisions in domains with heterogenerous data. 

 Artificial Intelligence and Decision Systems  
    
 This research area studies research topics traditionally linked to Artificial Intelligence along methods, techniques, models, and applications for decision support. In particular, inference models based on techniques for knowledge representation and management, and statistical inferences. Learning models and algorithms based on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data are designed and experimented, along with computational methods for optimization problems for data analytics. Also distributed approaches (multi-agent systems) for modelling and simulating complex systems, natural or artificial, are designed.  
 Within the large spectrum of research challenges associated to this area, the main research lines are:  
 design, development, and application of knowledge-based systems for decision support; 
  definition of learning and inference techniques for heterogeneous data generated in relational contexts, integrating content and structure analysis (social network analysis, text analytics); 
  definition of global stochastic optimization techniques and reinforcement learning for optmizing the hyperparameters in machine learning and automated configuration; 
  development of models and algorithms for automated reasoning and optimization for data analytics (text analytics and text mining, time series analysis, clustering); 
  development and application of algorithm for structural and parametric learning for continuous time Bayesian networks with applications to genetic regulatory networks; 
  development and experimenting with complex natural or artifical systems based on agent-based models (for example, vehicle or pedestrian traffic).

  The Multi-Agent-Based Simulation  book series        
 The MABS Steering Committee | Multi-agent systems   (MAS) is one of the most interesting technologies that have emerged in computer science in the last 20 years. As it is said in the  ATAL   home page, one of the most important workshops on the area in the late 90's, " Agents are autonomous computer programs, capable of independent action in environments that are typically dynamic and unpredictable. Agents have proven to be of interest in many important application areas, such as electronic commerce on the Internet, the control of space probes on missions to the outer planets, the design of user interfaces, to industrial process control  ". Within the computer science community, this technology was used specially in problem solving  . On the other hand, the models, software architectures and inplementations issued from the field could be very useful to another scientific discipline: social simulation  . Social scientists usually need some computational testbeds to test their theories about social interaction or emergence of conventions among others. The MABS workshop series aims to bring together researchers from artificial intelligence, computer science and social sciences interested in using multi-agent models and technology in social simulation.    
 MABS has been held every two years from 1998 to 2002, and annually since then. The workshop is now one of the most successful international forum for presenting and publishing research on the theory and practice of multi-agent-based simulation.

MABS 2024 - The 25th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation       Committees  Call for Papers  Accepted Papers  Registration  Program  MABS Series    

 We are excited to announce the Call for Papers for the 25th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS 2024), a pivotal event that brings together leading researchers from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) engineering and the social, economic, and organisational sciences.  
 MABS 2024 is part of the AAMAS 2024 conference taking place at The University of Auckland  in New Zealand on 6th-10th of May, 2024.  
 MABS 2024 continues its tradition of fostering cross-fertilisation and innovation in MAS engineering and complex social and sociotechnical systems modeling. The workshop encourages submissions in areas such as simulation methodology and tools, simulation of social and intelligent behaviour, diverse applications, and simulation analytics.  
 The MABS workshop has run alongside the main conference since AAMAS was first held in Bologna in 2002 and continues to attract a diverse and enthusiastic group of participants. This year’s focus will be on ‘Modelling and Simulation of Societies’, which aligns closely with one of the 10 themes of the main AAMAS conference.  
 For the MABS workshop, we encourage submission of work that is in a less finished state than we would expect to see at the main conference. We particularly encourage the submission of work that has open questions which would be worthy of discussion at the workshop.

  Workshop Format and Location.  After a successful in-person event in London in 2023, MABS 2024 aims to continue this format in New Zealand. The workshop will feature an invited speaker/s, paper presentations, and a concluding panel discussion. The workshop duration and presentation times will be contingent on the number of submissions.  
 Audience and Scope.  MABS 2024 welcomes social scientists, policy-makers, AI, MAS, and simulation researchers and developers. It’s an ideal platform for those engaged in modelling multi-agent systems and applying agent-based simulation in real-world scenarios.  
 Proceedings.  Post-proceedings will be reviewed further and published in the Springer LNAI series under “Multi-Agent-Based Simulation XXV, 25th International Workshop, Auckland, May 2024, Revised Papers”.  
 Target audience.  The workshop will provide a forum for social scientists, policy-makers, and AI, MAS and simulation researchers and developers, to assess the current state of the art in the agent-based modeling and simulation of social and socio-technical systems, to identify where and discuss how existing approaches can be successfully applied, to learn about new approaches and explore future research challenges, and to exchange ideas and knowledge in an interdisciplinary environment.  
 The workshop will be of interest to researchers engaged in modeling and analyzing multi-agent systems, and those interested in applying agent-based simulation techniques to real-world problems. In addition, it will attract researchers committed to cross-cutting research that is complementary to more orthodox modeling approaches.  
 MABS intends to be a place where researchers can exchange ideas about their work and we are looking forward to the community meeting once again in person.  
 Submission guidelines  
 Submissions are limited to 12 pages including references  formatted according to the Springer LNCS style  and must be electronically submitted before the submission deadline through the workshop conference system, which is available here:

 Legal Issues Papers  

 Use Case - Reuse of Emergency Calls embedded in TV Shows (official)  
 In this document, the ELRC legal helpdesk  analyzes under which legal conditions audio, video and dialogue subtitles coming from emergency calls embedded in a German TV show can be re-used for developing AI models.  
 Several legal aspects specific to the German legislation including intellectual property and copyright protection are reviewed. The use and sharing of different types of data (audio, video and transcriptions of the dialogues), and their derivatives, for research and commercial purposes, are also tackled.  

 What’s new in the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market  
 [This article was initially published in the ELRC+3 Newsletter on April 24, 2019]  
 1.Text and data mining exceptions (articles 3 and 4)   
 As per article 2(2), text and data mining (TDM) is defined as “any automated analytical technique aimed at analyzing text and data in digital form in order to generate information which includes but is not limited to patterns, trends and correlations”. The Directive provides for two exceptions for TDM: one mandatory (will be the same in all EU Member States) and one optional (Member States do not have to implement, or can implement a limited version thereof).  
 a) Mandatory TDM exception   
 Research organisations (only non-commercial or public, see article 2(1)) and cultural heritage institutions (libraries, museums and archives) can copy material that they have lawful access  to, in order to carry out TDM for scientific research purposes. The copies made in the process can be stored (with an appropriate level of security) for research purposes (including verification of results).  
 Right-holders can apply technological protection measures to prevent TDM of their content, but only to ensure the security and integrity of their networks and databases.  
 b) Optional TDM exception   
 This optional exception has potentially unlimited beneficiaries, and TDM can potentially be performed for any purpose. Reproductions made in the process can potentially be retained for as long as necessary. No sharing is allowed.  
 This exception only applies to content for which right-holders have not expressly reserved the right to mine (“mineable by default”). In other words, it is enough for the right-holder to indicate that she/he does not allow for her/his content to be mined under this exception to be able to lawfully prevent such acts.  
 2. Extended collective licensing (article 12)    
 Member States may allow collective management organisations (e.g. SACEM, VG Wort) to grant licenses (limited to the territory of the Member State) for use of all the works in their sector of activity (especially when seeking permission from individual authors would be too costly and impractical). Such a mechanism already exists in Scandinavian countries, where research institutions use it with a lot of success to negotiate access to data.  
 3. New exclusive right concerning online uses of press publications (articles 15 & 16)  
 Publishers of press publications will have a new exclusive right to prevent online uses of their publications by “information society service providers” (such as news aggregators). The right does not affect private or non-commercial uses by individuals. It does not apply to mere hyperlinking, and to the use of individual words or “very short extracts”. It does not in any way affect copyright and other related rights.  
 This right expired two years after the publication. Scientific and academic periodicals are excluded (article 2(4)).  
 The impact of this new right on the Language Technology community will be very limited, but it is important to mention it here, as it can easily be misinterpreted as granting free access to newspaper articles two years after their publication.  
 4. New rules concerning liability of online content-sharing service providers (articles 17 and ss.)  
 Online content-sharing service providers (OCSSP) are those who for profit-making purposes provide services whose main or one of the main purposes is to store and give the public access to a large amount of content uploaded by their users (article 2(6)). Not-for profit encyclopedias (Wikipedia), not-for-profit educational and scientific repositories (ArXiv), open source software developing and sharing platforms (GitHub), online marketplaces and some cloud services are excluded.  
 OCSSP need licenses from right-holders to provide their services (despite the fact that content is uploaded by users). Otherwise, they are liable for copyright infringement, unless they demonstrate that they made their best efforts to obtain a license, prevent access to infringing content and in any event acted promptly to disable access to the content upon receiving a notice from right-holders.  
 A license given to an OCSSP automatically grants users of the service rights to use the content for non-commercial purposes.  
 A license is not needed if the uploaded content was generated on the basis of the quotation exception, or the caricature/parody/pastiche exception (no research exception).  
 “Young” and small OCSSP (active for less than 3 years and with annual turnover of less than 10 million EUR) are subject to less strict obligations.  
 Right-holders are entitled to “appropriate and proportionate” remuneration for the use of their content by OCSSP. At least once a year, the OCSSP sends them information about the uses of their content, in particular regarding the modes of exploitation and the generated revenues. This information should also cover any uses made by sub-licencees.  
 The new Directive will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal (which will happen any day now). After that, the Member States will have 24 months to implement it in their national laws.  

 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
 [This article was initially published in the ELRC+3 Newsletter on March 28, 2019]   
 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation (2016/679) of 27 April 2016. It entered into force on 25 May 2018 and replaced the Data Protection Directive of 1995 (95/46/EC).  
 Unlike a directive (which requires transposition into national law), a regulation applies directly and uniformly across all the EU Member States. The shift from a directive to a regulation in the domain of data protection is therefore a very significant step towards unification of national laws, and the establishment of a single European market – in practice, however, numerous articles of the GDPR require national transposition (including some of those relevant to scientific research), so the legal framework remains fragmented.  
 Contrary to popular belief, the GDPR is far from being revolutionary. Most of the definitions and principles that governed the processing of personal data under the 1995 Directive remain the same. However, the administrative fines are now significantly higher: up to 20 000 000 EUR or 4% of global annual turnover (whichever is higher). The efforts to comply with the GDPR have therefore intensified, and so have the audits carried out by Data Protection Authorities (in France, Google was recently fined 50 000 000 EUR only for some features of their Android operating system).  
 “Personal data” is defined very broadly as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject)”. The notion covers directly identifying information (name, address, personal e-mail, phone number), but also elements that in combination with others may identify the person that they relate to (a mother of five of Moroccan descent who lives in Paris, works as a nurse and has a collection of 1960’s Jaguars). The ‘public’ and the ‘private’ spheres of life are equally protected. However, information related to legal persons (e.g. companies) as well as the deceased is not concerned (although some Member States may have specific protection for personal data of the deceased).  
 The process of “breaking the link” between the information and the person it refers to is called anonymization. Anonymized data are no longer personal data and can be processed without restrictions. However, the standard for anonymization is high: it should be irreversible, and the person should be impossible to identify by anyone and ‘by any means reasonably likely to be used’. Anonymization is now a research discipline in its own right: some well-described anonymization techniques include noise addition, k-anonymity and t-closeness.  
 “Processing” is also defined broadly as “any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means”. This includes collection, storage, consultation, transfer, but also deletion.  
 The person (natural or legal) that determines the purposes and means of processing is referred to as “data controller”. The person that merely processes data on behalf of the controller is called “data processor” (it is important to note that processors are not, contrary to popular belief, completely exempted from liability for processing).  
 In order to comply with the GDPR, processing has to respect the following principles:  
 lawfulness (see below), fairness and transparency; 
  purpose limitation (data can only be processed for a specified, explicit and legitimate purpose, and not further processed for an incompatible purpose); 
  data minimization (data processed have to be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary); 
  accuracy (data have to be accurate and when necessary kept up to date); 
  storage limitation (data cannot be stored for longer than necessary to achieve the purpose of processing); 
  integrity and confidentiality (data have to be stored in a secure environment and protected against unauthorized access or accidental destruction); 
  accountability (the data controller has to be able to demonstrate compliance). 
  In order to be lawful, processing has to be based on one of the grounds enumerated in article 6 of the GDPR. This is the case when, e.g. :  
 the data subject has given his informed consent to the processing (consent can be withdrawn at any time, but not retroactively); or 
  processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party; or 
  there is a legal obligation to process the data; or 
  there is a legitimate interest in the processing which overrides the interests of the data subject in the protection of his data. 
  Apart from the abovementioned principles, data controllers may have to comply with other obligations, such as:  
 keeping a register of data processing operations; 
  implementing “data protection by design and by default”; 
  when necessary (i.e. when the processing may result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subject), carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment prior to the processing. 
  The data subject has certain rights regarding his data, e.g.:  
 information (some information such as the identity of the controller and the purpose of the processing has to be provided to the data subject by the data controller, even if the data were not collected directly from the data subject; on the Internet, this is typically done via a ‘privacy policy’); 
  access and rectification; 
  erasure (“right to be forgotten”); 
  right to data portability; 
  right not to be subject to automated decision-making. 
  This strict framework is assorted with various exceptions, including for research purposes. First of all, research is exempted from the purpose limitation principle, as it is always regarded as a ‘compatible purpose’. Furthermore, the storage limitation principle is tempered, and rights of data subjects may also be limited. All those benefits are available under one condition: appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects have to be implemented. These may include pseudonymization, increased transparency, carrying out of a Data Protection Impact Assessment etc. The details are left for national legislators to decide, so it is important to know the national provisions in this respect.  

 European Commission adopts new standard license for online content  
 The European Commission has adopted the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) standard license to make information they publish online reusable by the public. [1]  But why do we need licenses and how do we use them correctly? What impact could the application of a standard license have for language data sharing? The ELRC consortium has asked Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki to help us understand the underlying implications.    
 ELRC  : Pawel, thank you for agreeing to this interview. Before we ask you about the CC BY 4.0 license itself, can you explain why we need a license when we want to reuse information that has been made openly available by the European Commission or other entities online?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : While raw information itself should and theoretically is free, its expression, or the data in which it is embodied, can be protected by intellectual property rights. These rights are in fact similar to traditional property: if you own a physical object, you can prevent others from using it, and sue anyone who does so without your permission. Intellectual property is the same, but – and this is what makes it both complicated and fascinating – it’s about immaterial goods: things of value that exist independently from their material support.  
 So, as I said, in principle, with a few exceptions, the use of IPR-protected content requires permission from the rightholder. This permission is granted in a document called ‘a license’. Licentia  means ‘permission’ in Latin.  
 ELRC  : To whom can such a license be granted?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : Usually, such a license is granted to a specific person or entity. However, a license can also be granted to the general public, i.e. everybody who has access to the content. The latter type of licenses is called ‘public licenses’ (although I really like the German term Jedermann-Lizenz  ). They were first developed with software in mind (we have all heard of the GPL, General Public License). At the very beginning of this century, the Creative Commons Foundation developed a series of public licenses for creative works, called… Creative Commons and maybe more commonly known as CC licenses.  
 The latest version of these licenses, the 4.0 version, covers not only copyright, but also related rights, such as the sui generis database right, which makes them a great tool for licensing of digital datasets in the European Union.  
 ELRC  : Could you explain (in one short sentence) what the sui generis database right entails?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : It’s an intellectual property right similar to copyright that was created by the Database Directive 1996 to protect investment in producing a database. I explain it in more detail in an article published in one of the recent ELRC newsletters ( http://lr-coordination.eu/node/969  ).  
 ELRC  : Coming back to CC licenses: what is their unique benefit?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : The idea behind Creative Commons licenses is simple: to grant everyone permission to use the work and thereby shift from the traditional ‘all rights reserved’ logic to ‘some rights reserved’. It is important to keep in mind that CC-licensed content is still under copyright, but a broad permission to use it (at least in a certain manner) is granted up front. The use of the work, however, is still subject to some conditions, the violation of which amounts to copyright infringement.  
 ELRC  : Can you explain the main characteristics of the “Attribution 4.0 International” license (CC BY 4.0)?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : BY or ‘attribution’ is the fundamental condition of all CC licenses. It is commonly believed that all that it requires is to mention the source. However, the attribution requirement under CC BY 4.0 goes further than this.  
 In short, the CC BY 4.0 license allows everyone to re-use, share and modify the licensed content, provided that:  
 the creator of the work is identified; 
  any other person or entity designated by the rightholder to receive attribution is identified (e.g. the funder); 
  the copyright notice (if present) is retained; 
  the CC BY 4.0 license is referred to, preferably with a URL; 
  if practicable, a URL to the original work should be retained; 
  if the content was modified, it should be indicated, too. 
  So, a proper attribution notice should at least look like this:  
 This work was created by P. Kamocki and is available under a CC BY 4.0 license  .  
 ELRC  : That does not sound like a very permissive license after all. Is the CC BY 4.0 an open license?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : CC BY 4.0 is by all accounts an open license, as it meets the criteria set forth in the Open Definition. Actually, only two CC licenses: CC BY and CC BY-SA are open licenses.  
 It should also be noted that no additional conditions or restrictions can be imposed on CC-licensed content. Therefore, anyone who shares CC-licensed content saying that it can only be used by institution x actually violates the license and infringes on the rightholder’s copyright. That said, modified versions of CC BY 4.0-licensed content can be shared under any conditions, including as ‘all rights reserved’. Only the SA (share-alike) requirement, for example in the CC BY-SA license, creates an obligation to share modified content under the same license.  
 ELRC  : What are the main changes to the previous (not international) version of this license and what are potential weaknesses of the license?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : Most importantly, the previous versions did not cover the sui generis database right, which meant that they did not provide for an appropriate level of legal security in the EU. In fact, a bona fide user of a dataset licensed under a CC BY 3.0 license could theoretically still be sued for infringement of the sui generis database right.  
 Secondly, previous versions of CC licenses had many national versions, called “ported versions”. These versions were not only translated, but also adapted to local law. Oftentimes, some rather far-reaching choices were made in the adaptation process. And since in legal matters every word counts, we ended up with rather substantial differences between for example Dutch and Belgian versions of the same license.  
 Now, imagine you want to use a dataset licensed under a Dutch version of the license. You know it may not be identical to the German version, so you should probably make an effort to read it first. But what if you don’t speak Dutch…? As you see, the porting process had some adverse consequences, and this is why porting for CC 4.0 licenses is not authorised.  
 ELRC  : The Commission has adopted the CC BY 4.0 license as a new standard license for the reuse of Commission documents. Is this concept easily transferrable to the reuse of Public Sector Information made available by national public administrations as well?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : There is no doubt that CC BY 4.0 is currently the best tool for those who want to make digital datasets openly available. So, the Commission made a wise choice.  
 However, this choice is not binding the Member States, some of which have their own, long-standing traditions when it comes to making Public Sector Information available for re-use.  
 Some countries, such as Poland or Germany, dedicate a fair share of Public Sector Information to the Public Domain. Public Domain material is by definition not protected by intellectual property rights and therefore cannot be licensed at all, it can be freely used by anyone for any purpose.  
 Many other countries have their own licenses, more or less inspired by or compatible with CC BY. I can think of France, Norway, and above all the UK. In the UK, public sector information is protected by copyright belonging to the Crown (so-called Crown copyright). It is then made available under a license called Open Government License.  
 Ireland, for example, endorses the use of CC BY 4.0 for Public Sector Information (Circular 12/2016 of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform), whereas France, probably for fear of ‘americanisation’, actually… prohibits the use of CC licenses (only Licence ouverte  and Open Database License are allowed by art. D323-2-1 of the Code des relations entre le public et l’administration  ).  
 Undoubtedly, some more harmonisation at the EU level would be welcome, and the official endorsement of CC BY 4.0 by the Commission is a step in the right direction.  
 ELRC  : In what way can making Public Sector Information available under the CC BY 4.0 license, for example in Open Data Portals, help to make language data sharing easier between national institutions but also across borders?  
 Dr. iur. Pawel Kamocki  : As mentioned above, CC 4.0 licenses cover not only copyright, but also the sui generis database right, which makes them a perfect tool for sharing digital datasets such as language resources (LR).  
 Unlike their previous versions, CC BY 4.0 will not have ‘ported’ versions. This indeed makes them perfect for international use.  
 The use of popular, internationally recognized tools can considerably reduce transaction costs related to the sharing of LR both at the national and the international level.  
 ELRC  : You made this rather complex issue much clearer. Thank you very much Pawel!  
  
 Pawel Kamocki was trained in both law and corpus linguistics; he holds a Dr. iur. degree from the University of Münster, as well as a docteur en droit degree from Sorbonne Paris Cité. Pawel is working for ELDA as a Legal Issues Expert.  
    
 The interview was conducted by Lilli Smal (DFKI) who is part of the ELRC consortium.

 Web crawling Report  
 This repor  t  was produced in the framework of “ ELRC+ L2 Project “Tools and Resources for CEF Automated Translation   “, under SMART 2015/1091 service contract granted by the European Commission.  
 The purpose of this report is to analyze the question whether and under what conditions web crawling operations can be lawfully conducted.  
 It starts with a general overview of web crawling, which briefly presents the procedure and discusses possible scenarios for which crawled data can be used. Then, it proceeds to the legal analysis of the problem, which takes into account such legal frameworks as copyright, the sui generis  database right, digital rights management, data protection, contract law and conflict of laws.  
 The analysis is focused on EU law (with the laws of Germany and France often quoted as examples), but some questions specific to the US law are also discussed. The Sanctions section discusses possible sanctions for unlawful web crawling.  
 The conclusion proposes a roadmap – a set of recommendations that should be taken into account before the start of any web crawling operation.

 Submission Details  
 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024 
 Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions) | October 30 - November 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025 | November 29, 2024 
 Camera-ready papers due | December 15, 2024 
 Tutorials and Workshops | January 19-20, 2025 
 Main Conference | January 21-24, 2025 
  
 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 All papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE: To be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted workshop paper is required to register for the conference at the “Workshop Registration” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
   
  During the initial paper submission process, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on th paper registration page. In particular, the paper registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 IMPORTANT:  
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100.

 Call for Tutorials COLING 2025  
 The 2025 International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2025) invites proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with the conference. We seek proposals in all areas of natural language processing and computation, language resources (LRs) and evaluation, including spoken language, sign language, and multimodal interaction.  
 We invite proposals for three types of tutorials, and we especially encourage submissions from early-career researchers:  
 Cutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas. The tutorials are expected to give a brief introduction to the topic, but participants are assumed to have some prior knowledge of the topic. The focus of the class will be on discussing the most recent developments in the field, and it will spend a considerable amount of time pointing out open research questions and important novel research directions.  
 Introductory to computational linguistics/NLP topics: tutorials that provide introductions to topics that are established in the COLING communities. The lecturers provide an overview of the development of the field from the beginning until now. Attendees are not expected to come with prior knowledge. They acquire sufficient understanding of the topic to understand the most recent research in the field.  
 Introduction to Key Concepts in Linguistics including Semantics, Syntax, Psycholinguistics, Neurolinguistics, and Sociolinguistics: tutorials that provide introductions to topics that are established or emerging in areas adjacent to CL/NLP. The lecturers provide an overview of the development of the field from the beginning until now. Attendees are not expected to come with prior knowledge. They acquire a sufficient understanding of the topic to understand the most recent research in the field and the relevance for the CL/NLP domains.  
 Each of these types of tutorials can either be half-day (4h long including a coffee break (30m long)) or full-day (8h long including two coffee breaks (1h long in total) but excluding a lunch break).  
 In all cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations. None of the tutorial types are expected to be “self-invited” long talks – the content should be a good balance between research from multiple groups and perspectives, not only from the teachers of the tutorial.  
 The tutorials will be held at COLING 2025 in Abu Dhabi, UAE, on 19 and 20 January, 2025.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).  
 Proposal submission due July 31, 2024  
  Notification of acceptance August 31, 2024  
  COLIING2025 tutorials January 19-20, 2025  
  COLING2025 conference January 21-24, 2025  
 Diversity and Inclusion  
  We particularly encourage submissions of underrepresented groups in computational linguistics, researchers from any demographic or geographic minority, with disabilities, or others. In the evaluation of the proposal, we will take these aspects into account to create a varied and balanced set of tutorials.  
 This includes several aspects of diversity, namely (1) how the topic of the tutorial contributes to improved diversity and increased fairness in the field, (2) if the topic is particularly relevant for a specific underrepresented group of potential participants, (3), if the presenters are from an underrepresented group.  
 Submission Details  
  They should contain:  
 A title that helps the potential attendees to understand what the tutorial will be about.  
  An abstract that summarizes the topics, goals, target audience, and type (see above) of the tutorial (this abstract will also be on the LREC-COLING website).  
  A section called “Introduction” that explains the topic and summarizes the starting point and relevance for our community and in general.  
  A section called “Target Audience” that explains for whom the tutorial will be developed and what the expected prior knowledge is. Clearly specify what attendees should know and be able to practically do to get the most out of your tutorial. Examples of what to specify include prior mathematical knowledge, knowledge of specific modeling approaches and methods, programming skills, or adjacent areas like computer vision. Also specify the number of expected participants.  
  A section called “Outline” in which the various topics are explained. This can be a list of bullet points or a set of paragraphs explaining the content. Explain what you intend and how long the tutorial will be.  
  A section called “Diversity Considerations”, discussing each of the three aspects of diversity mentioned above or others.  
  A section called “Reading List”: What are introductory papers or books that potential attendees can read to get a first impression of the tutorial content? What do you expect them to have read before attending? What does provide further information beyond the content of the tutorial?  
  A section called “Presenters” in which each tutorial presenter is briefly introduced in one paragraph, including their research interests, their areas of expertise for the tutorial topic, and their experience in teaching a diverse and international audience.  
  A section called “Other Information” which should include information on how many people are expected to participate and how you came to this estimate. You can also explain any other aspects that you find important, including special equipment that you would need.  
  A section called “Ethics Statement” which discusses ethical considerations related to the topics of the tutorial.  
  The proposals should be submitted no later than 31 July, 2024, 11:59 PM Samoa Standard Time (SST) (UTC/GMT-11, “anywhere on Earth”).  
 Submission is electronic. Please submit the proposals using the START system at this URL: https://softconf.com/coling2025/tutorialsCL25   
 Evaluation Criteria  
  The tutorial proposals will be evaluated according to their originality and impact, the expected interest level of participants, as well as the quality of the organizing team and Program Committee and their contribution to the diversity of the conference.  
 Each tutorial will be evaluated regarding its clarity and preparedness, novelty or timely character of the topic, the instructor’s experience, the audience interest, and the potential to increase diversity in our community.  
 Instructor Responsibilities  
  Accepted tutorial presenters will be notified by the date mentioned above. They must then provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the conference registration material by the specific deadlines. The abstract needs to be provided in ASCII format. The summary will be submitted in PDF format and can be updated from the version submitted for review. The instructors will make their material available in an appropriate way, for instance, by setting up a website. They will be invited to submit their slides to the ACL Anthology.

 List of Topics  
  ------------------  
  Just as coding assistants have dramatically increased productivity for coding tasks over the last two years, researchers in the NLP community have begun to explore methods and opportunities ahead for creating scientific assistants that can help with the process of scientific discovery and increase the pace at which novel discoveries are made. Over the last year, language models have been used to create problem-general scientific discovery assistants that are not restricted to narrow problem domains or formulations. Such applications hold opportunities for assisting researchers in broad domains, or scientific reasoning more generally. Beyond assisting, a growing body of work has begun to focus on the prospect of creating largely autonomous scientific discovery agents that can make novel discoveries with minimal human intervention.  
 These recent developments highlight the possibility of rapidly accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in the near term. Given the influx of researchers into this expanding field, this workshop proposes to serve as a vehicle for bringing together a diverse set of perspectives from this quickly expanding subfield, helping to disseminate the latest results, standardize evaluation, foster collaboration between groups, and allow discussing aspirational goals for 2025 and beyond. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  
 ***Literature-based Discovery:*** This topic focuses on using existing scientific articles to facilitate novel discoveries, by finding “undiscovered public knowledge’’, conditioning novel studies based on existing work, or easing the search and reading process. Systems that read the literature at scale may ultimately help us come up with research ideas that are more novel, broader in scope, and operationalized in more useful experiments.  
 ***Agent-centered Approaches:*** Agent models are being used to form end-to-end scientific discovery pipelines, with separate agents taking on different roles, such as hypothesis generation, execution, and reviewing experiments.  
 ***Automated Experiment Execution:*** Agents that can automatically execute experiments require a large number of pragmatic skills that emerging benchmarks are beginning to evaluate, including downloading data, writing code, and interfacing with apps.  
 ***Automated Replication:*** Science is generally suffering a “reproducibility crisis”, and NLP is not immune to this, with (for example) 59% of reproducibility attempts finding worse performance than papers originally reported. Automated reproducibility attempts to read original papers, Github repositories, and instructions, to replicate experiments fully automatically.  
 ***Data-driven Discovery:*** Reading existing papers and combining or re-analyzing existing datasets frequently allows for novel data-driven discoveries without having to collect new data empirically, and may yield inexpensive novel discoveries.  
 ***Discovery in Virtual Environments:*** Virtual environments, including text-based simulations, allow training and evaluating agents at aspects of the scientific discovery process in simulated proxy tasks without running physical experiments, which are costly and time consuming.  
 ***Discovery with Humans in the Loop:*** How can we make the textual knowledge from literature best engage with humans in the discovery process, through various interfaces, processes, and surfaces?  
 ***Assistants for Scientific Writing:*** Language models can be used as assistants in the scientific dissemination process, either as planners for writing text such as academic articles, or blog posts intended for public consumption.  
 Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------  
  We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular archival workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the OpenReview website set up for this workshop ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.  
 ***Archival, regular workshop papers:*** Authors should submit a paper up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome), with unlimited pages for references, following the ACL author guidelines. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers.  
  Non-archival regular workshop papers: This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date.  
 ***Non-archival cross-submissions:*** We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that have already appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the AISD audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.  
  In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.  
 Note to authors: While you submit your paper through OpenReview ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ), please select the “Submission Type” properly based on the guidelines.  
 For questions about the submission guidelines, please contact workshop organizers via aisd-organizers  [at] googlegroups.com

 MCU 2024  
 10th conference on Machines, Computations and Universality  
  5-7 June 2024 in Nice, France  

 The International  conference series MCU  traces its roots back to the  mid 1990's  , and has always been concerned with gaining a deeper understanding of  computation and universality  through the study of  models of general purpose computation.  Last edition took place in Debrecen, Hungary (2022). The before last edition was canceled because of COVID-19 pandemic (2020).   

 Aims and scope     
   
 The  scope of the conference  topics  includes  , but is not limited to, computation in the setting of  various discrete models  (Turing machines, register machines, cellular automata, tile assembly systems, rewriting systems, molecular computing models, neural models...),  analog and hybrid models  (BSS machines, infinite time cellular automata, real machines, quantum computing...) and the  meaning and implantation of universality  in these contexts. Particular emphasis is given towards search for  frontiers between decidability and undecidability  in the various models, search for the  simplest universal models  , computational  complexity of predicting the evolution  of computations in the various models.  Parallel computing  models and their connections to  decidability, complexity and universality  .
