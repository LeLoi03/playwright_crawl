 Submission to the early bird  

 Besides our regular submission process, we are excited to introduce an additional submission mechanism to accommodate the diverse needs of our participants: Early Bird Submission    , aiming to offer flexibilities, promote review quality, broaden participation, and foster an open and engaged community. The early bird submission will be hosted on OpenReview.net   . By participating in the early bird submission, you can refine your work based on constructive critiques from experts in the field, well before the regular submission deadline. The new mode shares the same reviewing and publication standards as the regular submission.  
 The early bird submission will accept long papers, only. The recommended formatting style is that of the IEEE proceedings, i.e. the traditional IEEE ICHI proceeding style. Paper submissions must adhere to the IEEE Proceeding`s Format.   
 The maximum paper length is up to 10 pages, plus references.  
  
 Early Bird and Regular Submission Deadlines   
 Early Bird Submission | Submission deadline: | Sep 07th, 2024 
  1st round notification: Oct 07th, 2024 | Initial reviews will be provided, categorizing submissions into ‘Accept,’ ‘Revise,’ or ‘Reject.’ 
  Revised version deadline: Nov 07th, 2024 
  Resubmission round and final notification: Dec 07th, 2024 
  Camera ready: March 07th, 2025 
  Submission platform (openreview): | Early bird submission – IEEE ICHI 2025 
  Implementing the early bird mode provides authors with opportunities to improve their submission. A submission can be accepted in the initial round review in the early bird (Oct 7th, 2024), in the resubmission round in early bird (Dec 7th, 2024), or in the regular submission.  
 If a paper is rejected in the early bird, authors may submit as a regular submission (submission by Jan 07 th  , 2025, notification by March 13th, 2025).  
 A paper accepted in the early bird may also be recommended for publication in the Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research  , following the decision of the chairs and of the EiC of the journal. The Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research highlights novel, cutting-edge contributions in computing for the health informatics research community. The publication policies of the JHIR apply.  
 If the early bird submission is accepted for publication in the JHIR, the paper must also be presented at the conference, requiring one author to register at the authors’ registration fee.  

 Reviewing  
   
 ICHI uses double-blind reviewing for full and short papers, submissions should therefore be anonymized and all references and links disclosing the authorship should be blinded appropriately.  

 Topics  
 IEEE-ICHI is dedicated to advancing areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), foundational principles of computer and information sciences and technology, communication technology to address challenges and problems in healthcare, and everyday wellness. Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research highlights novel, cutting-edge contributions in computing for the healthcare informatics research community. It covers three major tracks:  
 Analytics—focuses on advancing AI/ML-based decision support, generative AI, data analytics, knowledge discovery, and predictive modeling for healthcare research.

The supplementary material statement provides detailed descriptions to support the reproduction of the results presented in the paper (see below for details). The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. 
  Short papers | are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of ethical considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. 
  Demo papers | should be no more than two (2) pages, including references, and should describe implemented systems relevant to the NLG community. It also should include a link to a short screencast of the working software. In addition, authors of demo papers must be willing to present a demo of their system during INLG 2024. 
  Submissions should follow ACL Author Guidelines  and policies for submission, review and citation, and be anonymised for double blind reviewing. Please use ACL style files; LaTeX style files and Microsoft Word templates are available at https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html  .  
 Authors must honor the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics  . If your work raises any ethical issues, you should include an explicit discussion of those issues. This will also be taken into account in the review process. You may find this checklist  of use.  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to ensure that their work is reproducible; see, e.g., the following reproducibility checklist  . Papers involving any kind of experimental results (human judgments, system outputs, etc) should incorporate a data availability statement into their paper. Authors are asked to indicate whether the data is made publicly available. If the data is not made available, authors should provide a brief explanation why. (E.g. because the data contains proprietary information.) A statement guide  is available on the INLG 2024 website.  
 To submit a long or short paper to INLG 2024, authors can either submit directly or commit a paper previously reviewed by ARR via the same paper submission site  . For direct submissions, the deadline for submitting papers is May 31, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE  June 7, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE   . If committing an ARR paper to INLG, the submission is also made through the INLG 2024 paper submission site, indicating the link of the paper on OpenReview. The deadline for committing an ARR paper to INLG is June 24, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE  , and the last eligible ARR paper submission deadline for INLG 2024 is May 24, 2024  . It is important to note that when committing an ARR paper to INLG, it should be submitted through the INLG 2024 paper submission site, just like a direct submission paper, with the only difference being the need to provide the OpenReview link to the paper and to provide an optional author response to reviews.  
 Demo papers should be submitted directly through the INLG 2024 paper submission site  by June 24, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE  .  
 All accepted papers will be published in the INLG 2024 proceedings and included in the ACL anthology. A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2024 must not have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Dual submission to other conferences is permitted, provided that authors clearly indicate this in the submission form. If the paper is accepted at both venues, the authors will need to choose which venue to present at, since they can not present the same paper twice. Submitted papers for review at INLG 2024 must not be published elsewhere until after the notification of acceptance. Finally, at least one of the authors of an accepted paper must register to attend the conference.  
 Awards  
 INLG 2024 will present several awards to recognize outstanding achievements in the field. These awards are:  
 Best Long Paper Award | : This award will be given to the best long paper submission based on its originality, impact, and contribution to the field of NLG.

 INLG 2024: First Call for Workshop & Tutorial Proposals  
 17th International Conference on Natural Language Generation Tokyo, Japan, 23-27 September 2024  
  The 17th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2024) (https://inlg2024.github.io/) will be held in Tokyo, Japan, on 23-27 September 2024. Building on the success of previous years, we hope to include a number of independently organised research workshops and tutorials. These workshops and tutorials will take place immediately after or prior to the main conference. The INLG organisers and SIGGEN cordially invite workshop proposals for one-day or half-day workshops at INLG 2024.  
 Proposals can focus on any topic relevant to the Natural Language Generation community (NLG). We especially invite new and novel proposals in relatively new areas which have recently begun to attract interest in the research community, or topics where greater interaction between the NLG community and another established research community can be beneficial to both fields. Proposals that form part of an existing series, are also welcome.  
 Workshops and tutorials should provide an informal setting, where participants will have the opportunity to discuss technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active exchange of ideas. Proposals should also describe the format of the proposed workshop or tutorial. We encourage formats that will foster discussion and exchange of ideas (talks, posters, panels, invited speakers). Workshops and tutorials at INLG 2024 should be planned as half-day or full one-day events.  
 Proposals can be submitted via https://forms.gle/ApiTrNbZzFhhMJNd6. Should you have any questions, feel free to contact INLG 2024 Workshop Chair, Jing Li, email: jing-amelia.li@polyu.edu.hk

 The Generation Challenges (GenChal) are an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety of shared-task efforts that involve the generation of natural language. This year, Generation Challenges will be held as a workshop at the 17th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2024), scheduled on September 23-27 2024. The workshop will follow the format of previous GenChal results sessions, with presentations of results by the organisers of the generation challenges that are currently running, a poster session for task participants to present their submissions, as well as presentations of proposals for new shared tasks in the Task Proposals Track, and discussion sessions. You can see some of the previous GenChal tasks in the past GenChal proceedings on the ACL Anthology (see e.g. 2022 or 2023) or on the dedicated repository.  
 Submissions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, size and state of completion of data to be used, schedule and evaluation plans. Accepted shared tasks will be run in the 2025 iteration of INLG.  
 Important dates  
 Submission deadline: | June 24th 2024 | June 30, 2024  (extended!) 
  Notification: July 15th 2024 
  Camera-ready submission: August 16th 2024 
  Workshop at INLG conference: September 23rd-24th 2024 
  All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h ("anywhere on Earth").  
 Submissions and format  
 Submissions in the Shared Task Proposals track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long excluding citations, and should follow the ACLPUB formatting guidelines (see the main call-for-papers).  
 Proposals should be uploaded to the SoftConf INLG submission page, using the Submission type New shared task proposal.  
 Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will not be blind, there is no need to anonymise papers. This is not intended to be a selective process, since the aim is to discuss new potential shared tasks with INLG delegates. However, the organisers reserve the right to reject proposals which do not fall within the scope of the GenChal initiative, or which do not follow guidelines. Accepted submissions will be published in separate GenChal 2024 proceedings.

 While large language models (LLMs) offer to become a viable alternative to traditional rule-based data-to-text (D2T) natural language generation (NLG), they still suffer from well-known neural model issues, such as lack of controllability and risk of producing harmful text. There are many potential solutions to this problem up for discussion.

 Rapid advances in generative models for both language and vision have made these models increasingly popular in both the public and private sectors. For example, governments use generative models such as chatbots to better serve citizens. As such, it is critical that we not only evaluate whether these models are safe enough to deploy, but also ensure that the evaluation systems themselves are reliable. Oftentimes, humans are used to evaluate these models. Our goal is to call attention to the discussion on how to best perform reliable human evaluations of generative models.

  (NAACL 2025 workshops will take place in Albuquerque, New Mexico May 3–May 4, 2025)  
 List of Topics  
  ------------------  
  Just as coding assistants have dramatically increased productivity for coding tasks over the last two years, researchers in the NLP community have begun to explore methods and opportunities ahead for creating scientific assistants that can help with the process of scientific discovery and increase the pace at which novel discoveries are made. Over the last year, language models have been used to create problem-general scientific discovery assistants that are not restricted to narrow problem domains or formulations. Such applications hold opportunities for assisting researchers in broad domains, or scientific reasoning more generally. Beyond assisting, a growing body of work has begun to focus on the prospect of creating largely autonomous scientific discovery agents that can make novel discoveries with minimal human intervention.  
 These recent developments highlight the possibility of rapidly accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in the near term. Given the influx of researchers into this expanding field, this workshop proposes to serve as a vehicle for bringing together a diverse set of perspectives from this quickly expanding subfield, helping to disseminate the latest results, standardize evaluation, foster collaboration between groups, and allow discussing aspirational goals for 2025 and beyond. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  
 ***Literature-based Discovery:*** This topic focuses on using existing scientific articles to facilitate novel discoveries, by finding “undiscovered public knowledge’’, conditioning novel studies based on existing work, or easing the search and reading process. Systems that read the literature at scale may ultimately help us come up with research ideas that are more novel, broader in scope, and operationalized in more useful experiments.  
 ***Agent-centered Approaches:*** Agent models are being used to form end-to-end scientific discovery pipelines, with separate agents taking on different roles, such as hypothesis generation, execution, and reviewing experiments.  
 ***Automated Experiment Execution:*** Agents that can automatically execute experiments require a large number of pragmatic skills that emerging benchmarks are beginning to evaluate, including downloading data, writing code, and interfacing with apps.  
 ***Automated Replication:*** Science is generally suffering a “reproducibility crisis”, and NLP is not immune to this, with (for example) 59% of reproducibility attempts finding worse performance than papers originally reported. Automated reproducibility attempts to read original papers, Github repositories, and instructions, to replicate experiments fully automatically.  
 ***Data-driven Discovery:*** Reading existing papers and combining or re-analyzing existing datasets frequently allows for novel data-driven discoveries without having to collect new data empirically, and may yield inexpensive novel discoveries.  
 ***Discovery in Virtual Environments:*** Virtual environments, including text-based simulations, allow training and evaluating agents at aspects of the scientific discovery process in simulated proxy tasks without running physical experiments, which are costly and time consuming.  
 ***Discovery with Humans in the Loop:*** How can we make the textual knowledge from literature best engage with humans in the discovery process, through various interfaces, processes, and surfaces?  
 ***Assistants for Scientific Writing:*** Language models can be used as assistants in the scientific dissemination process, either as planners for writing text such as academic articles, or blog posts intended for public consumption.  
 Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------  
  We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular archival workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the OpenReview website set up for this workshop ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.  
 ***Archival, regular workshop papers:*** Authors should submit a paper up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome), with unlimited pages for references, following the ACL author guidelines. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers.  
  Non-archival regular workshop papers: This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date.  
 ***Non-archival cross-submissions:*** We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that have already appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the AISD audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.  
  In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.  
 Note to authors: While you submit your paper through OpenReview ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ), please select the “Submission Type” properly based on the guidelines.  
 For questions about the submission guidelines, please contact workshop organizers via aisd-organizers  [at] googlegroups.com

 The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum  is dedicated to documenting the events and aftermath of the atomic bombing on August 6, 1945. It is part of the larger Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. The museum offers a poignant and educational experience, with exhibits that include personal belongings of victims, photographs, and multimedia displays detailing the devastation caused by the bomb. The museum's mission is to promote peace and raise awareness about the consequences of nuclear warfare. A key feature of the museum is its focus on the human stories behind the tragedy, making it a powerful symbol of peace and reconciliation.  

 Miyajima Island (Itsukushima)    
 Miyajima Island  , also known as Itsukushima  , is a famous island located in the Seto Inland Sea near Hiroshima. It is renowned for its Itsukushima Shrine  , a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is famous for its "floating" torii gate that appears to hover over the water during high tide. The island is considered sacred, with a long history as a site of Shinto worship.

  Plagiarism Policy   
  
  Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else’s prior ideas, processes, results or words without explicit acknowledgement of the original author and source. Self-plagiarism occurs when an author utilizes large part of his/her own previously published work without using appropriate references. This can range from getting the same manuscript published in multiple journals to modifying a previously published manuscript with some new data.   
   
  The conference is strictly against any unethical act of copying or plagiarism in any form. Plagiarism is said to have occurred when large portions of a manuscript have been copied from existing previously published resources. By submitting the manuscript to the journal, the author(s) confirm that it is an original manuscript, is unpublished work and is not under consideration elsewhere.   
   
  Plagiarism, including duplicate publication of the author's own work, in whole or in part without proper citation is not tolerated by the journal. Manuscripts submitted to the journal need to be checked for originality using anti-plagiarism software. Please cross-check your document for plagiarism using anti-plagiarism software like Turnitin/ iThenticate before it is submitted for publication to the conference.    

 Conference Review Policy  
 The submissions are subject to a double-blind peer review process by at least two reviewers with expertise in the relevant subject area.  

 Authors will be notified about their submission results in three weeks.  

 Submissions will be evaluated based on the abstract/proposal.  

 Based on the reviewers’ comments, papers are accepted, rejected or accepted with revision.  

 If the comments are not addressed well in the revised paper, then the paper is sent back to the authors to make further revisions.  

 Authors whose papers are rejected may submit papers for the next call for papers after the necessary revisions are made.  

  Reviewing Criteria used by the reviewers:    
 Degree of Originality 
  Introduction 
  Methods 
  Findings 
  Proper Use of Language 
  Relevance of Title and Content 
  Reviewer's Other Comments

  Plagiarism Policy   
  
  Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else’s prior ideas, processes, results or words without explicit acknowledgement of the original author and source. Self-plagiarism occurs when an author utilizes large part of his/her own previously published work without using appropriate references. This can range from getting the same manuscript published in multiple journals to modifying a previously published manuscript with some new data.   
   
  The conference is strictly against any unethical act of copying or plagiarism in any form. Plagiarism is said to have occurred when large portions of a manuscript have been copied from existing previously published resources. By submitting the manuscript to the journal, the author(s) confirm that it is an original manuscript, is unpublished work and is not under consideration elsewhere.   
   
  Plagiarism, including duplicate publication of the author's own work, in whole or in part without proper citation is not tolerated by the journal. Manuscripts submitted to the journal need to be checked for originality using anti-plagiarism software. Please cross-check your document for plagiarism using anti-plagiarism software like Turnitin/ iThenticate before it is submitted for publication to the conference.    

 Conference Review Policy  
 The submissions are subject to a double-blind peer review process by at least two reviewers with expertise in the relevant subject area.  

 Authors will be notified about their submission results in three weeks.  

 Submissions will be evaluated based on the abstract/proposal.  

 Based on the reviewers’ comments, papers are accepted, rejected or accepted with revision.  

 If the comments are not addressed well in the revised paper, then the paper is sent back to the authors to make further revisions.  

 Authors whose papers are rejected may submit papers for the next call for papers after the necessary revisions are made.  

  Reviewing Criteria used by the reviewers:    
 Degree of Originality 
  Introduction 
  Methods 
  Findings 
  Proper Use of Language 
  Relevance of Title and Content 
  Reviewer's Other Comments 

 Virtual Presentation  

 Virtual participants will receive presentation certificates and their papers will appear in program, abstracts, and proceedings books like with our face-to-face conferences. Participants will receive all conference documents (Conference Program Book, Conference Abstract Book, Certificate of Participation, and Proceedings Book) digitally.  

 The Zoom platform will be used for the virtual presentations. The confirmed presenters will be informed to participate in the virtual presentation.  

 The duration of each presentation may vary between 15 and 20 minutes based on the number of presentations in the session.  

 After peer-reviewing process, all full papers will be published in the conference proceedings book, the annual book or one of the sponsor journals.

 The internet of things (IoT) is a platform that allows a network of devices (sensors, smart meters, etc.) to communicate, analyze data and process information collaboratively in the service of individuals or organizations. The IoT network can generate large amounts of data in a variety of formats and using different protocols which can be stored and processed in the cloud. The conference looks to address the issues surrounding IoT devices, their interconnectedness and services they may offer, including efficient, effective and secure analysis of the data IoT produces using machine learning and other advanced techniques, models and tools, and issues of security, privacy and trust that will emerge as IoT technologies mature and become part of our everyday lives.  
 Big Data (BD) has core values of volume, velocity, variety and veracity. After collecting much data from IoT, BD can be jointly used with machine learning, AI, statistical and other advanced techniques, models and methods, which can create values for people and organizations adopting it, since forecasting, deep analysis and analytics can help identify weaknesses and make improvements based on different analysis.  
 Maintaining a high level of security and privacy for data in IoT are crucial and we welcome recommendations, solutions, demonstrations and best practices for all forms of security and privacy for IoT and BD.

  IEEE Transactions On Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (TCAD) 
  TCAD Paper Submission Instructions 

 TCAD Paper Submission Instructions   

 The IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD) is published monthly. Manuscripts considered for publication should focus on algorithms, methods, techniques, and tools for the automated design of integrated circuits and systems, and on related areas. Submitted papers may be of a survey or research nature. Research papers must present original contributions and must show significant new material over descriptions or derivations available elsewhere. Survey papers are only by invitation, and should review the state-of-the-art in specific CAD fields and, at the same time, provide the readers with research perspectives and future challenges in the considered topic. Proposals for the organization of special issues are not allowed in TCAD; they are only by invitation.  
 The IEEE must of necessity assume that material submitted for publication is available for general dissemination. It is the responsibility of the Author, not the IEEE, to determine whether disclosure of their material requires the prior consent of other parties and if so, to obtain it.  

 A. Process for Submission of a Manuscript    
 Only electronic submissions will be considered. Papers should be submitted at https://ieee.atyponrex.com/journal/tcad   

 B. Style for Submission of Manuscript    
 All manuscripts must be formatted using the IEEE two-column format. Style templates can be found at | http://www.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org | . (Minimum font size is 10 pt). 
  The maximum number of pages allowed for submissions is: | Regular Papers: 14 pages 
  Transactions Brief Papers: 5 pages 
  Submitted papers that are not compliant with either the style format or the allowed page lengths will be returned to the Author. 
  The manuscript should include an informative 100- to 250-word abstract, at the head of the manuscript, which will appear with the paper. Index terms and 4-to-8 keywords describing the manuscript are also required. 
  References should appear in a separate bibliography section at the end of the paper, with items referred to by numerals in square brackets, e.g., [12]. In either case, references should be complete and in IEEE style. | Style for papers: Author, first initial(s) followed by last name, title, volume, including page numbers, month, and year. 
  Style for books: Author, title, location and publisher, year, chapter or page numbers (if desired). 
  Guideline for final manuscript preparation: Detailed instructions for preparation of the final manuscript is in the | Author guidelines for final manuscript preparation | . 

 C. Graphical Abstract    
 This journal accepts graphical abstracts and they must be peer-reviewed. For more information about graphical abstracts and their specifications, please visit the following link: http://www.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/   

 D. Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)    
 All IEEE journals require an Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)  for all authors. ORCIDs enable accurate attribution and improved discoverability of an author’s published work. The author will need a registered ORCID in order to submit a manuscript or review a proof in this journal.  
 Follow these steps to link a ScholarOne account to a registered ORCID:  
 Login to ScholarOne and click on your name in the top row of the screen. 
  Click E-mail / Name in the dropdown menu. 
  In the ORCID section at the top of the page, click the appropriate link to either register for a new ORCID or associate the account with an existing ORCID. 
  A new page will open to create and/or validate your ORCID. Once the validation is complete, the new page will close and you will return to ScholarOne. 
  Save the changes to your ScholarOne user account. 
  Authors who do not have an ORCID in their ScholarOne user account will be prompted to provide one during submission.  

 E. Disclosure of Previous Submissions    
 Authors should disclose versions of this paper that were already peer-reviewed for publications in other journals and conferences within the past two years, immaterial of the outcome.  
 If an earlier version of this paper was rejected by a different publication or conference, please provide information on how reviewer and editor comments from that review were handled. This can also include remarks that point out disagreements of the author's viewpoint with review comments from other publications.  
 If an earlier version of the paper has been accepted for conference/workshop publication or has already appeared in a conference/workshop proceeding, the authors should clearly identify the substantive improvement over the earlier conference/workshop version.  
 The material in this submission should be at least 30% different in content from any prior accepted/published version, but it is up to the review process to determine whether the additional contributions are substantive. Examples of substantive enhancements include modifications/enhancements to algorithms, improvements in evaluation methodology, new insights from additional benchmarks. Examples of additional content that does not contribute to the 30% requirement include (but is not limited to): an expanded literature review or a broadening of the introductory or background material usually does not count towards the 30% requirement.  
 Concurrent submissions of any kind (journal, conference, workshop) to this Journal are not allowed and no extensions of any previously published journal version will be accepted.  
 If a submission has no previous peer-reviewed versions, it should clearly state this on the cover page.  

 F. Policy on Self-Plagiarism    
 IEEE Publications has long indicated that verbatim copying another's work (plagiarism) is unacceptable author conduct. Moreover, the IEEE Board of Directors approved in November 2002 a new policy on Duplicate Publication and Self-Plagiarism. This policy is included in the IEEE Policies document, precisely in Sections 6.4.1B(f) and 6.4.1B(h). These two sections are indicated next:  
 (f) Plagiarism is unacceptable. The verbatim copying or reuse of one's own research) as indicated in paragraph "h" below) is considered another form of plagiarism or self-plagiarism; it is unacceptable. 
  (h) Except as indicated in Section 6.3.4 (Multiple Publication of Original Technical Material in IEEE Periodicals), authors should only submit original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication nor which is under review for another refereed publication. If authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a basis for a new submission, they are required to cite the previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new submission offers substantial novel contributions beyond those of the previously published work(s). 
  As a result, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS will carefully monitor possible self-plagiarism conducts. As a result, it will not accept for review manuscripts where a significant portion of the text is a verbatim copy of the text already published in previous works. In particular, as general requirements:  
   
 The submission material shall not have more than 40% total text overlap percentage with prior accepted/published versions of the work. 
  The authors need to include both in their cover page of the submission material and in the text of the manuscript (e.g., related work section) a clear and concise statement about the contribution of the submitted paper with respect to each of their prior relevant works. The manuscript's statement must refer to the appropriate citation(s) of the authors' previous work(s). 

 G. Review Process    
 The IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS publishes only peer-reviewed papers. The Editor will assign each submitted manuscript to an Associate Editor, who will rely on anonymous reviews to decide on the acceptance of the paper, on mandatory modifications, and on the publication in full or short form. The Author is responsible for checking the galley proofs prior to publication.  
 The articles in this journal are peer-reviewed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual  . Each published article was reviewed by a minimum of two independent reviewers using a single-anonymous peer-review process, where the identities of the reviewers are not known to the authors, but the reviewers know the identities of the authors. Articles will be screened for plagiarism before acceptance.  

 H. Open Access    
 This publication is a hybrid journal, allowing either Traditional manuscript submission or Open Access (author-pays OA) manuscript submission. Upon submission, if you choose to have your manuscript be an Open Access article, you commit to paying the discounted $2,645 OA fee if your manuscript is accepted for publication in order to enable unrestricted public access. Any other applicable charges (such as over-length page charge and/or charge for the use of color in the print format) will be billed separately once the manuscript formatting is complete but prior to the publication. If you would like your manuscript to be a Traditional submission, your article will be available to qualified subscribers and purchasers via IEEE Xplore. No OA payment is required for Traditional submission.  

 I. Page Charges    
  After a manuscript has been accepted for publication, the Author’s institution will be approached with a request to pay a voluntary charge of $110 per page to cover part of the cost of publication. If the voluntary page charge is not honored, IEEE will charge a mandatory page charge of $175 per page for each page in excess of 9. Detailed instructions will accompany the page proofs. The color charge fee structure has been simplified to a flat $275 per printed color figure.  

 J. Copyright    
 It is the policy of the IEEE to own the copyright to the technical contributions it publishes. To comply with IEEE copyright policy, Authors are required to sign an IEEE Copyright Transfer Form before publication in either the print or electronic medium. Authors must submit a signed copy of this form with their manuscript.

  About Interspeech 

 About Interspeech  
 ISCA manages the organization of an annual conference, Interspeech, which integrates two previous series of biennial international conferences: EUROSPEECH, the European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology, and ICSLP, the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing. Since 2000, both conferences have been held under the common label INTERSPEECH. The first Interspeech event was ICSLP 2000, which took place in 2000, in Beijing, China.      

  Previous EUROSPEECH conferences were held in 1989 in Paris (France); 1991 in Genoa (Italy); 1993 in Berlin (Germany); 1995 in Madrid (Spain); 1997 in Rhodes (Greece); and 1999 in Budapest (Hungary); Previous ICSLP conferences, coordinated by the Permanent Council for the Organization of International Conferences on Spoken Language Processing (PC-ICSLP), were held in 1990 in Kobe (Japan); 1992 in Banff (Canada); 1994 in Yokohama (Japan); 1996 in Philadelphia (USA); and 1998 in Sydney (Australia). All INTERSPEECH conferences are recorded chronologically here  .  
   
  INTERSPEECH conferences include papers on all the scientific and technological aspects of Speech. More than 1,000 participants from all over the world attend the conference annually to present their work in oral and poster sessions. Several satellite workshops and a Scientific and Industrial Exhibition highly enrich the conference content. INTERSPEECH conferences may be held in any country, although they generally should not occur in the same continent in two consecutive years. The next Interspeech conferences will be held in Greece (2024)  , Rotterdam, the Netherlands (2025)  , and Sydney, Australia (2026).   
 INTERSPEECH papers are indexed in ISI, Engineering Index, Scopus, and Google Scholar. It is rated as Rank A conference by the Computing and Research Education Association of Australasia ( CORE   ).

 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI.

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024.

 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 About the ISCA Archive  
 The Archive team  
 The ISCA Archive was originally assembled by Wolfgang Hess (Bonn, Germany), who has also managed it throughout most of its history; since 2016 it has been looked after and extended by Martin Cooke (Ikerbasque, Spain), recently joined by Sebastian Le Maguer (U. Helsinki, Finland).  
 Recent changes  
 [Mar 2024] added 6 laughter workshops 
  [Jan 2024] moved to isca-archive.org 
  [Jan 2024] modified metas to allow indexing by Google Scholar 
  [Sept 2023] Sebastian Le Maguer joins the archive team 
  [June 2022] fast search now covers abstracts 
  [May 2022] many conferences from the past 20 years have been added (TIPS, LISTA, ISCSLP and others) 
  [Sept 2021] added browsing/search functions, enabling users to find papers by topic/author quickly 
  [Sept 2021] support for DOIs, which are now assigned to all INTERSPEECH conferences since 2004 and many conferences post-2016, with more to come 
  [Sept 2021] introduced author-year-conference naming structure, making it easy to find papers after downloading 
  [Aug 2021] increased visibility for conferences that were somewhat hidden away in the previous archive 
  [Aug 2021] added bibtex to each abstract to ease citations 
  [Aug 2021] made archive mobile- and tablet-friendly 
  [aug 2021] resolved some inconsistencies that have crept in over the years 
  Found an error?  
 We are always interested to hear of any errors that you spot. Please note that it is not possible to modify pdfs, and any changes to authors, titles and abstracts should exactly match the content of the pdf. Errors should be reported to archives at the isca-speech main email address (not forgetting the dot org).  
 Getting papers into the archive  
 If you are organising a conference in the field of speech communication, or have organised one in the past and wish to explore placing papers in the Archive, please contact us at the archives email mentioned above.  
 Can I place a copy of my paper in an institutional or other repository?  
 Yes.

 About the ISCA Archive  
 The Archive team  
 The ISCA Archive was originally assembled by Wolfgang Hess (Bonn, Germany), who has also managed it throughout most of its history; since 2016 it has been looked after and extended by Martin Cooke (Ikerbasque, Spain), recently joined by Sebastian Le Maguer (U. Helsinki, Finland).  
 Recent changes  
 [Mar 2024] added 6 laughter workshops 
  [Jan 2024] moved to isca-archive.org 
  [Jan 2024] modified metas to allow indexing by Google Scholar 
  [Sept 2023] Sebastian Le Maguer joins the archive team 
  [June 2022] fast search now covers abstracts 
  [May 2022] many conferences from the past 20 years have been added (TIPS, LISTA, ISCSLP and others) 
  [Sept 2021] added browsing/search functions, enabling users to find papers by topic/author quickly 
  [Sept 2021] support for DOIs, which are now assigned to all INTERSPEECH conferences since 2004 and many conferences post-2016, with more to come 
  [Sept 2021] introduced author-year-conference naming structure, making it easy to find papers after downloading 
  [Aug 2021] increased visibility for conferences that were somewhat hidden away in the previous archive 
  [Aug 2021] added bibtex to each abstract to ease citations 
  [Aug 2021] made archive mobile- and tablet-friendly 
  [aug 2021] resolved some inconsistencies that have crept in over the years 
  Found an error?  
 We are always interested to hear of any errors that you spot. Please note that it is not possible to modify pdfs, and any changes to authors, titles and abstracts should exactly match the content of the pdf. Errors should be reported to archives at the isca-speech main email address (not forgetting the dot org).  
 Getting papers into the archive  
 If you are organising a conference in the field of speech communication, or have organised one in the past and wish to explore placing papers in the Archive, please contact us at the archives email mentioned above.  
 Can I place a copy of my paper in an institutional or other repository?  
 Yes. For any paper published in the proceedings of INTERSPEECH or other ISCA sponsored events whose copyright is transferred to ISCA, ISCA grants each author permission to use the paper in that author's dissertation or in institutional and public repositories such as arXiv, provided that the paper is correctly cited, with DOI if available. This permission applies to all authors of the article. Authors are required to refer to the paper as specified in the ISCA Archive rather than refer to the institutional or public repository copy of the paper.  
 Copyright for papers submitted to INTERSPEECH  
 The following statement defines copyright for papers submitted to INTERSPEECH  
 By each submission of a paper to INTERSPEECH-20xx, the author(s) hereby warrant(s) that the manuscript has been submitted to ISCA (the International Speech Communication Association) for publication in the INTERSPEECH 20xx Proceedings, IS ORIGINAL AND HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION OR PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE and that all trademark use within the manuscript has been credited to its owner or written permission to use the name has been granted. In addition, the author(s) acknowledge(s) that all images such as tables, screenshots, graphics, etc., do not have a copyright that is held by a third party. The author(s) agree(s) to, and hereby assign(s) all rights, title and interest, including copyrights, in and to the manuscript to ISCA. The author(s) retain(s) the rights to any intellectual property developed by the author(s) and included in the manuscript. Note that the ISCA reviewing process is confidential. The copyright is provisionally transferred to ISCA at the time of submission of the article. This copyright is definitively assigned to ISCA if the manuscript is accepted after the reviewing process. If the manuscript is not accepted, the copyright transfer to ISCA is thus abrogated.  
   
 Can I order a print copy of the INTERSPEECH proceedings?  
 Yes, by visiting this page.

   What is IPCO?  
 IPCO (Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization) is a conference that is sponsored by the Mathematical Programming Society. IPCO is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. There are two key features of the IPCO conferences:  
 First, there are no invited talks. Instead, a program committee selects the contributions on the basis of extended abstracts submitted by prospective participants. 
  Second, the papers at the meeting are presented in a single stream (no parallel sessions), and preliminary versions of all papers are provided to participants at the beginning of the meeting. 
  The presented papers are published in the proceedings of the conference. These proceedings serve as a conference record as well as a means of rapid dissemination of results, since they are published within six months of submission. Most journals, including Mathematical Programming, Mathematics of Operations Research, INFORMS Journal on Computing, Operations Research, SIAM Journal on Computing, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, SIAM Journal on Optimization, Theoretical Computer Science do not view publication of an early version of a paper in an IPCO proceedings as a prior publication which would otherwise make the paper unacceptable.  
  What is the Scope of IPCO?  
 The two themes of IPCO - integer programming and combinatorial optimization - are viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in topics such as  
 approximation algorithms 
  branch and bound algorithms 
  branch and cut algorithms 
  computational biology 
  computational complexity 
  computational geometry 
  cutting plane algorithms 
  diophantine equations 
  geometry of numbers 
  graph and network algorithms 
  integer programming 
  matroids and submodular functions 
  on-line algorithms and competitive analysis 
  polyhedral combinatorics 
  randomized algorithms 
  random graphs 
  scheduling theory and scheduling algorithms 
  semidefinite programs 
  In all these areas, IPCO welcomes structural and algorithmic results. IPCO is not restricted to theory. Computational and practical work, implementations, novel applications of these techniques to practical problems, and revealing computational studies, are most welcome.  
  Which Type of Paper is Appropriate for IPCO?  
 The main acceptance criteria used by the program committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. These acceptance criteria have made it possible for younger, less established researchers to present their results in an attractive format to a large audience of active researchers. The program committee normally consists of researchers from a broad variety of fields. Therefore, someone preparing an extended abstract can safely assume that a large portion of the program committee will not be experts in the topic of the paper. These are precisely the readers to whom the abstract should be directed. It also is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. And of course, the claimed results should be correct and new.  
  The Timing of IPCO  
 IPCO is held every year, normally in late spring. Until 2018 years divisible by three (ISMP years) were skipped. From 2021 on, IPCO does take place also in ISMP years, normally with a considerable temporal and geographic distance. The submission deadline usually is in the late fall of the year preceding the meeting. All submissions are read by the program committee. Approximately two months after the deadline, the program committee meets and decides which papers to include in the meeting. Authors are usually notified of the decision of the program committee in the end of January. Authors of accepted papers are asked to submit a final version (which may again be an extended abstract or a full paper) by early spring. These final versions are printed in the proceedings of IPCO, which are provided to all participants at the conference. Finally, the IPCO conference then takes place in May or June. An IPCO conference usually takes three days. During these three days, approximately thirty-three papers are presented; each lecture is thirty minutes long.

   What is IPCO?  
 IPCO (Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization) is a conference that is sponsored by the Mathematical Programming Society. IPCO is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. There are two key features of the IPCO conferences:  
 First, there are no invited talks. Instead, a program committee selects the contributions on the basis of extended abstracts submitted by prospective participants. 
  Second, the papers at the meeting are presented in a single stream (no parallel sessions), and preliminary versions of all papers are provided to participants at the beginning of the meeting. 
  The presented papers are published in the proceedings of the conference. These proceedings serve as a conference record as well as a means of rapid dissemination of results, since they are published within six months of submission. Most journals, including Mathematical Programming, Mathematics of Operations Research, INFORMS Journal on Computing, Operations Research, SIAM Journal on Computing, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, SIAM Journal on Optimization, Theoretical Computer Science do not view publication of an early version of a paper in an IPCO proceedings as a prior publication which would otherwise make the paper unacceptable.  
  What is the Scope of IPCO?  
 The two themes of IPCO - integer programming and combinatorial optimization - are viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in topics such as  
 approximation algorithms 
  branch and bound algorithms 
  branch and cut algorithms 
  computational biology 
  computational complexity 
  computational geometry 
  cutting plane algorithms 
  diophantine equations 
  geometry of numbers 
  graph and network algorithms 
  integer programming 
  matroids and submodular functions 
  on-line algorithms and competitive analysis 
  polyhedral combinatorics 
  randomized algorithms 
  random graphs 
  scheduling theory and scheduling algorithms 
  semidefinite programs 
  In all these areas, IPCO welcomes structural and algorithmic results. IPCO is not restricted to theory. Computational and practical work, implementations, novel applications of these techniques to practical problems, and revealing computational studies, are most welcome.  
  Which Type of Paper is Appropriate for IPCO?  
 The main acceptance criteria used by the program committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. These acceptance criteria have made it possible for younger, less established researchers to present their results in an attractive format to a large audience of active researchers. The program committee normally consists of researchers from a broad variety of fields. Therefore, someone preparing an extended abstract can safely assume that a large portion of the program committee will not be experts in the topic of the paper. These are precisely the readers to whom the abstract should be directed. It also is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. And of course, the claimed results should be correct and new.  
  The Timing of IPCO  
 IPCO is held every year, normally in late spring. Until 2018 years divisible by three (ISMP years) were skipped. From 2021 on, IPCO does take place also in ISMP years, normally with a considerable temporal and geographic distance. The submission deadline usually is in the late fall of the year preceding the meeting. All submissions are read by the program committee. Approximately two months after the deadline, the program committee meets and decides which papers to include in the meeting. Authors are usually notified of the decision of the program committee in the end of January. Authors of accepted papers are asked to submit a final version (which may again be an extended abstract or a full paper) by early spring. These final versions are printed in the proceedings of IPCO, which are provided to all participants at the conference. Finally, the IPCO conference then takes place in May or June. An IPCO conference usually takes three days. During these three days, approximately thirty-three papers are presented; each lecture is thirty minutes long.

   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

 Title: Structurally tractable graph classes   
  Abstract:  Sparsity theory, initiated by Ossona de Mendez and Nesetril, identifies those classes of sparse graphs that are tractable in various ways – algorithmically, combinatorially, and logically – as exactly the nowhere dense classes. An ongoing effort aims at generalizing sparsity theory to classes of graphs that are not necessarily sparse. The notion of twin-width, developed by Bonnet, Thomasse and co-authors, is a step in that direction. A theory unifying the two is anticipated. It is conjectured that the relevant notion characterising dense graph classes that are tractable, generalising nowhere denseness and bounded twin-width, is the notion of a monadically dependent class, introduced by Shelah in model theory. In this tutorial, I will discuss the fundamental notions and results in this quickly developing area. This development combines tools from structural graph theory, logic, and algorithms.  
 Furthermore, IPEC will host an invited talk by one of the 2024 EATCS-IPEC Nerode Prize winners: Hans L. Bodlaender, Fedor V. Fomin, Daniel Lokshtanov, Eelko Penninkx, Saket Saurabh  , and Dimitrios M. Thilikos.  
 Title: (Meta) Kernelization   
  Paper published at:  J. ACM 63(5): 44:1-44:69 (2016), announced at Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 2010.  
  Abstract:  In a parameterized problem, every instance I  comes with a positive integer k  . The problem is said to admit a polynomial kernel if, in polynomial time, one can reduce the size of the instance I  to a polynomial in k  , while preserving the answer. In this work we give two meta-theorems on kernelzation. The first theorem says that all problems expressible in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic and satisfying a coverability property admit a polynomial kernel on graphs of bounded genus. Our second result is that all problems that have finite integer index and satisfy a weaker coverability property admit a linear kernel on graphs of bounded genus. These theorems unify and extend all previously known kernelization results for planar graph problems.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 The papers are submitted via EasyChair  .  
 Each submission is required to be in the LIPIcs format. We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper, with title page containing only the title and abstract and the references placed at the very end of paper. However, the first 12 pages (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat these 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion). PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions, but these submissions will not be eligible for the best student paper and the best paper. Besides this constraint, to be eligible for the best student paper, all the authors must be students at the time of the submission.  
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years. 
  Same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
   
 Double-blind reviewing  
 As in previous years, IPEC employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv  , and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs.  
 PACE 2024  
 The Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) was conceived in Fall 2015 to deepen the relationship between parameterized algorithms and practice. Topics from multivariate algorithms, exact algorithms, fine-grained complexity, and related fields are in scope.  
 This year’s challenge is about the one-sided crossing minimization problem (OCM). This problem involves arranging the nodes of a bipartite graph on two layers (typically horizontal), with one of the layers fixed, aiming to minimize the number of edge crossings. OCM is one of the basic building block used for drawing hierarchical graphs. It is NP-hard, even for trees, but admits good heuristics, can be constant-factor approximated and solved in FPT time.  
 For more details on the timeline and past challenges, please visit the PACE website  .

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track.

  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award.

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI.

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024.

 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI.

 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.
